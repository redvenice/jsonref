It\u0027s also reversing the cuts inflicted on our community by the Conservatives over the last eight hard years of austerity.\u0027Eight years of Tory austerity have undermined much of the social fabric of our society and is putting our future at risk. \u0027Faced with this scale of damage inflicted on our community, we need decisive action to end and reverse austerity, not some vague promises for the future and a few financial conjuring tricks.\u0027Mr McDonnell warned that a \u0027temporary bodge\u0027 over Brexit would do nothing to ease the concerns of investors worried about the lack of economic certainty.He said Mr Hammond - seen as the leading supporter in the Cabinet of a business-friendly \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 - had to take his share of the blame for the problems in the negotiations.\u0027His failure to stand up to the fanatical no-dealers in Cabinet and in his own party makes him as culpable as the Prime Minister for this unholy mess that is putting our economy at risk,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is no use him trying to stand on the sidelines, throwing out the occasional statistical analysis from the Treasury, when it was him who was among the first to publicly threaten a no deal.          Mr McDonnell suggested making good on Theresa May\u0027s promise to end austerity meant reversing the cuts introduced since the coalition came to power in 2010          The shadow chancellor was sporting a painful facial injury after tripping over rubbish in the dark earlier this week\u0027A temporary bodge to get the Prime Minister and him through the next couple of months with no permanency to the deal will not alleviate the fears of investors and business leaders. Far from a Brexit bounce, we will see an ongoing draining of future resources from our economy.\u0027Mr McDonnell was asked five times on Sky News whether he would match the government\u0027s promise to freeze fuel duty, but dodged answering.\u0027We will see what proposals come forward next week. I don\u0027t want to speculate,\u0027 he said. \u0027I want to see the detail of what he\u0027s bringing forward and see whether or not there is something in that that might help in terms of tackling climate change, which is one of our big issues as well.\u0027 Earlier, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Mr McDonnell acknowledged that Labour plans involved significant spending commitments.\u0027They are big. We have said what we would do is we would have a fair taxation system and that will enable us to fund the public services because we cannot go on the way we are,\u0027 he said.\u0027It will require increasing taxes. We have said we will increase income tax on the top 5 per cent, we will reverse some of the corporation tax cuts, we will crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion.\u0027So we have said honestly there would be an increase in taxes.\u0027IFS chief Paul Johnson told Today that the spending commitments in the Labour manifesto from the last election had been \u0027huge\u0027.\u0027It is simply well beyond anything we have seen in the past in terms of the scale of change,\u0027 But Mr Johnson pointed out that programme did not include fully rolling back the austerity brought in under the coalition.\u0027Their manifesto was not about ending austerity,\u0027 he said. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said: \u0027Just like last time Labour\u0027s reckless plans would undo all the hard work of the British people and result in more debt, higher taxes and fewer jobs.\u0027Labour\u0027s eye-watering unfunded spending would let debt spiral out of control and see more taxpayers money spent on debt repayments, rather than on public services.\u0027We will continue to take a balanced approach, living within our means so we can invest in the things that matter.

It\u0027s also reversing the cuts inflicted on our community by the Conservatives over the last eight hard years of austerity.\u0027Eight years of Tory austerity have undermined much of the social fabric of our society and is putting our future at risk. \u0027Faced with this scale of damage inflicted on our community, we need decisive action to end and reverse austerity, not some vague promises for the future and a few financial conjuring tricks.\u0027Mr McDonnell warned that a \u0027temporary bodge\u0027 over Brexit would do nothing to ease the concerns of investors worried about the lack of economic certainty.He said Mr Hammond - seen as the leading supporter in the Cabinet of a business-friendly \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 - had to take his share of the blame for the problems in the negotiations.\u0027His failure to stand up to the fanatical no-dealers in Cabinet and in his own party makes him as culpable as the Prime Minister for this unholy mess that is putting our economy at risk,\u0027 he said.\u0027It is no use him trying to stand on the sidelines, throwing out the occasional statistical analysis from the Treasury, when it was him who was among the first to publicly threaten a no deal.

We have said what we would do is we would have a fair taxation system and that will enable us to fund the public services because we cannot go on the way we are,\u0027 he said.\u0027It will require increasing taxes. We have said we will increase income tax on the top 5 per cent, we will reverse some of the corporation tax cuts, we will crack down on tax avoidance and tax evasion.\u0027So we have said honestly there would be an increase in taxes.\u0027IFS chief Paul Johnson told Today that the spending commitments in the Labour manifesto from the last election had been \u0027huge\u0027.\u0027It is simply well beyond anything we have seen in the past in terms of the scale of change,\u0027 But Mr Johnson pointed out that programme did not include fully rolling back the austerity brought in under the coalition.\u0027Their manifesto was not about ending austerity,\u0027 he said. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said: \u0027Just like last time Labour\u0027s reckless plans would undo all the hard work of the British people and result in more debt, higher taxes and fewer jobs.\u0027Labour\u0027s eye-watering unfunded spending would let debt spiral out of control and see more taxpayers money spent on debt repayments, rather than on public services.\u0027We will continue to take a balanced approach, living within our means so we can invest in the things that matter.

Eheu!Lord Hain made his remarks at the end of a session which, paradoxically, had seen the House of Lords at its worst: a stringy, whingey debate about how they nearly all wanted a second referendum on our membership of the EU.          Lord Hain (pictured) made his remarks at the end of the session in parliamentEx-Whitehall poohbahs such as Lord Butler and Lord Kerslake piled in to take this view, their line being that the voters had not been clued-up enough to know that voting to leave the EU was a dreadful idea.Whitehall’s hatred of Brexit is puzzling. Our looming independence from the EU will actually make the civil service more powerful because it will be able to make more decisions free from Brussels interference. You’d have thought they might like that.But the high point of the debate, at least in comedy terms, came not during speeches by grandees such as Ming Campbell or even ciggy-voice ex diplomat Lord Kerr of Kinlochard (he argued that ‘nobody voted for the Brexit we’re going to get’ – true, mate, because people like you have tried to muck it up!). No. The pinnacle of the day’s intellectual engagement, its Ciceronian oratory, its Noel Cowardesque sophistication, came when fighty bantam Lord Sugar (Crossbench) jumped to his size sixes to give us his, er, wisdom.After an opening in which he succinctly torpedoed the bad-losers nature of a second referendum, he proceeded to tangle himself in logic, rather as a kitten will become tied up in wool.          He argued that Boris Johnson (pictured) and Michael Gove should have gone to prison for selling Brexit on a false prospectusHe argued that Boris Johnson and Michael Gove should have gone to prison for selling Brexit on a false prospectus.Then he said that Brexit would possibly not have been voted for by 17.4million people had he, the mighty Sugarlump, only accepted David Cameron’s invitation to lead the Remain side’s arguments in the referendum campaign’s closing TV debate. ‘I know that in my forceful manner,’ he jawed, ‘I’d have made Boris admit he was lying. Who knows, maybe that could have swung the vote.’Ever the charmer, he also took a swipe at former Labour MP Gisela Stuart for supporting immigration-sceptic Leave. How dare she? She herself was merely ‘a German immigrant’!Lord Kerr, sitting beside not-so-sweet Sugar, was deliciously hard to read. "},{"url":null,"title":"Women SAS TIM COLLINS asks just case PC meddling","story":"    Royal Army Medical Cops medic Corporal Vicky Helsby (left), 29, from Runcorn, and Private Johnson in Salisbury todayBut these were no ordinary females.

The key, as I’ve said, was operational needs. But today, it seems, the Military has changed radically. The announcement by the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, that there are no roles in the military that women cannot do surely suggests that SAS selection will be opened up to them. This could mean one of two things: Women being allowed to attempt selection as it stands, which they will physically fail or that selection will be somehow modified to accommodate them. If the latter is true, it would be utterly misguided because not only would it lower standards, it also is totally unnecessary.As I’ve explained, women have been able to join the SAS in the past without going through traditional selection – and this has been driven by operational need.My fear, however, is that the Defence Secretary’s announcement is not driven by such a need, but by politics.The fact is that the men of the SAS are selected to be an elite. The physical expectation of them is fearsome.We can either abandon our ability to complete such operations in order to fall into line with political correctness or accept that there are some things females cannot do biologically. My fervent hope is that Gavin Williamson is doing this for all the right reasons and not because he has caved into the bankrupt military equality lobby which he so long resisted. "},{"url":null,"title":"Suspicious package near LA office Sen Dianna Feinstein","story":"    A suspicious package was found at the building that houses California Sen.

Sergio Bucher, Chief Executive of Debenham, has backed calls for lower business rates‘So when you are facing a tough market, having business rates that continuously go up is a clear headwind and we definitely need our Government to take action to establish a level playing field across the retail industry.’Mr Bucher added that action on business rates was crucial in securing the future of the struggling high street.I can’t pre-empt what the Chancellor is going to announce on Monday.

It is also, it claims, “the UK’s leading political art prize”. The five artists on this year’s shortlist offer perspectives from Thailand, Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria as well as the US, and yet the shadow of America looms largest. Well it does, doesn’t it? Growing up in Wales, I dreamt of America because it was not England. Now Trump’s America is a nightmare that keeps the world awake, and electrifies the best work in this uneven exhibition.I can’t immediately see the politics in American artist Trevor Paglen’s crystal-clear telescopic photograph of the moon. This beautifully detailed image of rugged craters and dark dust seas appears simply to be glorious astrophotography. Perhaps it refers to conspiracy theories about the Apollo moon landings. Because, guys, this is a very large photograph of the moon and I cannot – repeat, cannot – see any evidence of a human landing. Just saying. #moonlandingsfakedOn a second look, I seem to see a satellite trail. For Paglen’s innocuous-seeming moon belongs to a series in which he exposes how many spy satellites move spookily through the night sky. He has used the techniques of astronomical photography to take pictures not of stars or nebulae but the tracks of surveillance craft. Using data from folk who take a keen interest in these things, he has set his telescopic camera on a long exposure to reveal bright white lines of state technology streaking through space. One photograph is a fantastic abstract swirl of satellite orbits revolving madly, as they might in the mind of a paranoid conspiracy theorist.These are photographs of a state of mind. I am not saying they don’t show what they claim to show. Their power as art, however, comes from the fact that they might not. Paglen really does surf the data universe in a project to spy on the spies. Yet his art is as much about his obsession as it about anything the quest exposes. In another series he aims his telescopic lens at secret bases in the American desert. A man talks into his phone as he descends from a jet on who knows what covert business. A spy plane waits on a runway. Blurred, low-lying military buildings shimmer in the heat. Yet I can’t help visualising the artist, hidden among rocks, focusing his camera on the secret state. A man with a monomaniacal mission. Paglen’s art is the latest in a long line of American reflections on the poetry of paranoia, from films such as The Parallax View and The Conversation to the novels of Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon. He stares into the heart of America at this moment, beset by rage and terror.Moroccan artist Bouchra Khalili has also looked into America’s abyss. Her film Twenty-Two Hours tells how French literary hero Jean Genet went to the US in 1970 to help the Black Panthers. I found this emotionally charged documentary compelling. It goes into arcane and oddly fascinating details such as how Black Panther Doug Miranda got Yale students and staff to strike in support of imprisoned Black Panther party leaders. He told them they needed to take up the gun, he remembers. When he suggested a strike instead, everyone was so relieved to be spared the armed struggle that the strike was a big success.The Black Panther party can’t be repeated, Miranda says. It belongs to history. The revolution needs to learn from history and move on. The film director Jean-Luc Godard also turns up in archive footage and watching this engaged cinematic lecture is like watching him at his most radical.Armed with that lesson I tried to negotiate Egyptian artist Anna Boghiguian’s visions of the Welsh steel industry. White, male, working-class Welshmen protest and riot in her cartoonish cut-outs amid paintings of heavy industrial plants in which steel pipes and tubes become the tendrils connecting the world together. It’s all a chaotic romp, yet the steel industry is apparently meant to represent the coils of global capitalism.That same interconnectedness is depicted as a line linking objects through space in a tapestry by Nigeria’s Otobong Nkanga. So not only is this a political prize but it’s one that seems determined to fold all the shortlisted artists into its own curatorial thesis about the global crisis of capitalism. Or something of that kind. The artists are inevitably done a disservice by this. Instead of showcasing their talent, the exhibition seems to be using them as human slogans.What happened to rewarding artistic quality? Or is that now synonymous with expressing the correct worldview? Any prize shortlist that insists on a common intellectual approach by its chosen artists – political, religious, whatever – is clearly not being objective in its quest for excellence. Indeed it appears proud of that. I’d be happier if the judges shortlisted an artist whose politics repelled them. The provocative French writer and artist Michel Houellebecq would be one choice to liven up this tame event where every good artist apparently thinks the same as the curators do about everything.It comes as a relief that it is so difficult to take any political message from Thai film director and artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s cinematic shadow play Invisibility. Unfortunately it’s hard to take much else from it, either. Vague events are played out in fragmentary light. The projection stops and starts. Maybe it’s about the impossibility of communication.Paglen and Khalili are the best artists here and they both cut deeply into the rifts of our troubled age. Since Paglen has already had a lot of awards they should give this one to Khalili. She can use the money in her Genet-like romantic pursuit of global revolution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe52592842efe1611eae994268b706ade56bcf2/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d509e3464e299dfd7b2a87b6a93bb58","title":"life on the tiny island of migingo in pictures","story":"A rounded rocky outcrop covered in metal shacks, Migingo Island rises out of the waters of Lake Victoria like an iron-plated turtle.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

On Fridays he flies by private jet to the family home in tax-free Monaco or to wherever their £100m superyacht Lionheart is moored. It’s a life far removed from Green’s first job buying up excess clothing from bankrupt companies and selling it on to market traders.Having built a fortune in the retail industry the 66-year-old tycoon loves a good party, especially for his birthday. His party for his 55th in the Males lasted five days, reportedly featured a troupe of topless dancers and performances by George Michael and Jennifer Lopez. It was said to have cost about £20m.So many of his famous friends – including Kate Moss and the Vogue editor Anna Wintour – arrived by private jet that the local airport authorities refused to allow any more to park on the tarmac. The party for his 60th, billed as PG60, was held at the Rosewood Mayakoba resort in Mexico, with performances from Robbie Williams, Stevie Wonder and the Beach Boys. His presents have included a £7m Gulfstream jet and a £250,000 gold Monopoly set.His 65th birthday party, in March last year, was a sedate affair by Green’s standards – just an intimate dinner for 100 close friends at the China Tang restaurant in the Dorchester hotel. After dining on £60 bowls of bird’s nest soup with guests including Tess Daly and the Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, it was a short trip home to the suite he uses as a base for running his Topshop business empire.Earlier this year Green told Oliver Shah, the author of his unauthorised biography Damaged Goods, that the #MeToo debate had gone too far. “Where’s this all going to end,” he said. “There’s no stag parties, no hen parties, no more girls parading in the ring at the boxing. So they’re all banned?”Shah said Green told him on another call: “You really are a sick fucker. I thought you told me you were going to try and write an intelligent book. I’m not sure you could spell the word intelligent, but never mind. What is it you want to achieve? Nobody’s going to buy your fucking book.”Green, who was born in 1952 to entrepreneurial parents who had a string of businesses from launderettes to a portfolio of buy-to-let properties, is not afraid to confront people who challenge him. They include the veteran Labour MP Frank Field and a long list of journalists who questioned his business operations or tax affairs.“Do I say fuck off?” Green said when asked about his bad language by Shah, according to a piece the journalist wrote in Tatler. “Yes, if people don’t behave themselves. Journalists say I’ve bullied them. Well, if they behave like cunts, they get told to fuck off.”It was the acquisition of BHS in 2000 that put Green on the map and on course to become a billionaire. Savage cost-cutting increased BHS’s profits and allowed him to pay himself, his wife Tina who controls the family empire, and other partners more than £400m in idends.He went on to take over Arcadia Group, the parent company of Topshop, in 2002. In 2004 and 2005 he tried and failed for the second and third time to take over M\u0026ampS, which at one point led him to grab the retailer’s chief executive Stuart Rose by the lapels.Green will, however, be forever associated with the downfall of BHS. He sold the historic retailer to the former bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1 in March 2015. The company collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs 13 months later, leaving a pension deficit of about £571m.A high-profile parliamentary investigation into BHS’s demise concluded that the owners had systematically plundered the company, and described the hole in the pension fund as “the unacceptable face of capitalism”.It led to calls for Green to be stripped of his knighthood, awarded by Tony Blair for services to the retail industry in 2006. Green had boasted that he had Blair on speed dial. Blair described Green as “the person who thought up the dream and dreamt the dream into reality”.More than 100 MPs voted in favour of a motion for his knighthood to be cancelled and annulled by the honours forfeiture committee. It was the first time that MPs had proposed someone be stripped of a knighthood.The threat was dropped when Green agreed to pay £363m into the BHS pension scheme in 2017. “Once again I would like to apologise to the BHS pensioners for this last year of uncertainty, which was clearly never the intention when the business was sold in March 2015,” he said at the time. “I hope that this solution puts their minds at rest and closes this sorry chapter for them.”Tina Green, who said she thought her future husband was dreadful when she first met him at a party in 1985, lives in Monaco, where the family own a luxury apartment and their £100m superyacht Lionheart is often berthed.She collected a £1.2bn idend from Arcadia in 2015, the biggest in British corporate history. No tax was paid on the idend because of her Monaco base. The Greens have amassed an estimated fortune of £2bn and are ranked as the 61st richest people in the UK on the Sunday Times Rich List."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5adb6d895e904fd398940d5dbb4a0e0042169a89/0_7_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd58fad92cc188d7087607875f41548e","title":"debenhams in decline what has gone wrong","story":"The retailer is grappling with formidable challenges such as high rents and online shoppingDebenhams has crashed to an annual loss of nearly £500m and confirmed plans to close almost a third of its stores. What has gone wrong?Debenhams has 165 stores around the country, which is too many mouths to feed at a time when its sales are falling and costs are rising. The company had previously outlined plans to close 10 loss-making stores within five years but as its finances continue to deteriorate – it has issued three profit warnings this year - that figure has risen to 50.Last year’s business rates revaluation added pressure on the department store chain’s finances. Retailers with stores in parts of the country where there have been property booms have been particularly hard hit because rates are calculated as a proportion of a property’s value. The company’s business rates bill increased to £80m this year, not so far off the its the firm’s market value.The retailer is best known for the Designers at Debenhams collections created over the past two decades by designers including Jasper Conran and Julien Macdonald.

Theresa May has pledged to give tenants access to the government’s new rogue landlord database after the  and ITV News investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch – and that even when landlords’ names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them.In an interview with the , John McDonnell said: “Landlord licensing is not fit for purpose and the problem of rogue landlords is extensive. We need an effective scheme, local authorities that are properly resourced and improved tenants’ rights.“We are running a consultation to consolidate the powers available to local authorities and I would be in support of a national licensing scheme, in order to make regulation consistent for all landlords across the country and to stop the rogues from switching local authorities.” and ITV News investigation showed how rogue owners are collecting rents – often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit – despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales.Because of the way the law is written – with the tests applying on a borough-by-borough basis – this is usually perfectly legal. It allows landlords to be banned in one borough and operate in another.Landlord licensing came in as part of the the Housing Act, which came into force in 2006 and applies to England and Wales. Under that legislation, landlords must be considered “fit and proper” to be issued with a licence.McDonnell’s comments have been echoed by experts in the sector, who in some cases have been calling for a complete overhaul of housing law, as well as other MPs.Writing in the , David Lammy, the Labour member for Tottenham, said: “To fix this broken system, we need a complete rebalancing of the power relationship between landlords and tenants. The underlying issues of the housing crisis will only be solved by the construction of social and genuinely affordable housing on an unprecedented scale.“Meanwhile, law-breaking and exploitative landlords on the private rental market should be recorded comprehensively and transparently on the government’s database. Local authorities must be given the teeth to properly punish the worst predators.”“We should consider introducing a national landlord registration scheme that could support and complement local licensing schemes by making it easier for local authorities to identify criminal landlords, while recognising the need for locally-led enforcement.Until 2013, licensing typically applied to landlords renting out houses in multiple occupation (HMO). An HMO is a property with at least three people who are not from a single household but share facilities such as a toilet and kitchen. In England and Wales, a “large HMO” – with at least five people from more than one household who share facilities – must be licensed.Selective schemes, under which local authorities can require landlords to have a licence no matter what type of property they were renting out, began to be introduced from 2013.However, they vary hugely from local authority to local authority. There are currently 44 local authorities in England and Wales with selective licensing schemes running. Of those, only four cover the whole of the borough in which they are enacted, according to the property technology company GetRentr.The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, said: “This government is committed to tackling rogue landlords who continue to exploit their tenants. Through fines and banning orders, local authorities are already equipped with strong powers, and I expect them to use them. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home, and I will continue to work with the sector to ensure this is the case.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa0411b0e4628144a2fa7da777ae5c572e1c473/0_395_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfa2525afed13798da16d4df1c67810d","title":"weloveatl how instagram fell in love with atlanta in pictures","story":"A hashtag that started as a way of promoting local photographers has become a movement of love for the city, with over a million postsAtlanta lives on Instagram as #weloveatl, a hashtag started by three local photographers in 2012 to corral shots of the city on social media for a photography exhibition at Young Blood Gallery. They received more than 5,000 submissions and the show ultimately included 275 photos from over 100 local photographers. But the hashtag has lived on well past that show.In the years since, #weloveatl has turned into a movement, with over 1m posts to the hashtag on Instagram and 69,000 followers for @weloveatl. “If you say #weloveatl, it’s a proclamation, it’s different than identifying where you’re at, it’s saying ‘I love my city’ or ‘we love our city’,” co-founder Tim Moxley said in a 2014 interview.Co-founder Brandon Barr told  Cities #weloveatl is now registered as a not-for-profit corporation to connect, support and boost Atlanta’s photographers, online and off, with exhibitions and installations throughout the city. The aim, he said, was to support local nonprofits and promote the love of ATL.“For us as founders, it’s been exciting to give this platform to the many talented photographers in the city and be constantly surprised by the visual storytelling of this community,” Barr said. “It’s a city constantly writing its own story, and that’s pretty special.”Atlanta continues to make its mark on Instagram. Search the city’s hotspots and you’ll find gleaming high-rises and packed stadiums, signage and street art – and even urban rainbows.Lauren Holley, who founded the Atlanta Urban Photo Walkers meetup and posts herself as @graphiknation, says Atlanta flies under the radar with most international travellers, and is best known for its airport. “I think that’s kind of part of the appeal – when people end up here by chance, maybe because of a job, convention or school, they feel surprised – like they ‘discovered’ something really special about a city they never thought much of.” Cities is in Atlanta this week for a special week of journalism.

The question – how not to get sick – generates the same basic answers each year, but still the promise of a magic bullet lingers on. Last year, it was hand sanitiser. If I could distribute travel-size dispensers into every jacket pocket I possessed, no germs would dare to come near me. (They did.)Windows were a thing one year fresh air would do the trick. (It didn’t.) I’ve never gone as far as the Sars mask, but I have definitely gone through mad phases of not holding the pole in the subway.The real answer, I know, is to eat and sleep better but this seems unachievable, or at least deeply uninteresting without some programmatic element with grander marketing promises to make me immortal. And so this year, after everyone in my household promptly got sick three days into autumn and has been engaged in a relay race of infections ever since, it’s meal prep. If I can make my fridge look like a trolley on an airplane, we will hack this cold season and emerge fighting fit in the spring.In this, at least, I am helped by the food preparation services of New York, which have proliferated in the last few years so that any requirement can be met and delivered to your door. If you’re on a blockbuster diet – Paleo, say, or the Whole30 – there is a company that will deliver those meals every day. There is a new company devoted to “fitness” meal plans, which seems to involve the same combination of protein, carb and fibre as its competitors, with the exception that every meal comes with a jaunty fitness-inspired name: “bodybuilder’s essential white rice”, for example, or “athlete chicken teriyaki”.Actually, I tried that last one this week and the chicken did look like it had done a hard workout. The homespun version of all this is meal-prep Sunday, a movement on Instagram and elsewhere in which people post photos of a week’s worth of meals they have prepared on Sunday night. It is supposed to encourage, but something about the image of seven salads in mason jars or a week’s worth of neatly deconstructed chilli bowls fills me with despair.The difficulty is primarily one of scale. Left to my own devices I will eat any old crust I can find lying around, and seem to have existed for three years solely on leftover fish fingers, so clearly there is work to be done. But the outsourcing impulse, or the adoption of radical new habits, is a piece of avoidance that ends up like all other grand schemes – in the bin.The sensible thing, I know, is simply to shop better, which doesn’t mean panic-buying 75 kiwis and, over the course of two weeks, watching them slowly disintegrate on top of the microwave. Still, it is hard to let go of the idea there is something better out there, something bolder and more definitive in its results.And so I go back to the internet. “Avoid contact with people who are sick,” seems to be the main headline on more than one health website, which in my case would mean moving to a separate house from my children. After another night of coughing, I think I have finally found the answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/844166166a804645b22df31ed49da84e2d237066/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9d9a9ad384bfc48300659dc0c0384a","title":"the guardian view on black sea shipwrecks discovering our past","story":"The seabed produces archaeological wonders. The Mary Rose, which sank in the Solent in 1545, and the Vasa, which capsized in 1633 in the harbour of Stockholm, are just two of the famous ships that have been lifted from the deep. There is a long history of fishermen finding classical bronzes in the Mediterranean: the great statue of Zeus (or Poseidon) in the Athens Archaeological Museum was chanced upon in 1928 off Cape Artemision. Still entrancing and puzzling researchers and the public is the Antikythera mechanism, a remarkable orrery-cum-computer (somewhat resembling Philip Pullman’s “alethiometer”) discovered in a wreck in 1902, now also in Athens. At the British Museum in 2016, crowds came to marvel at the Sunken Cities exhibition, the fruit of investigations of the submerged ancient towns of Thonis-Heracleion and Canopus, which once stood at the mouth of the Nile. Damien Hirst exploited the romance of underwater archaeology in his 2017 exhibition in Venice, Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable, which playfully purported to be the fruit of an actual excavation – according to taste, either a brilliant postmodern conceit or utterly preposterous.Now it is the turn of the Black Sea. The Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP), the largest ever expedition of its type, recently completed three seasons of research off the Bulgarian coast, and has this week been holding a seminar in London on its findings. The team, comprising 70 crew from 15 countries, was led by Professor Jon Adams of Southampton University each year they were also accompanied by British school pupils, selected as Stem scholars to assist in the work. The primary aim was to try to understand the changes in the level in the Black Sea after the ice age, which have been subject to a wide range of theories (including that the sea experienced a sudden inundation from the Mediterranean that gave rise to the biblical story of the Flood, a theory that the MAP researchers have found no evidence to support). Highly sophisticated surveying techniques were used to map the seabed. And along the way, 65 wrecked ships were discovered, uncannily well-preserved owing to the fact that the deep waters of the Black Sea lack oxygen.The researchers, using remotely operated vehicles to explore the seabed, produced detailed images and 3D prints of the wrecks. They found 19th-century ships, Ottoman ships, Byzantine ships. Then, towards the end of the expedition, Roman ships. Finally there was the heartstopping find of what is thought to be a Greek ship from the lifetime of Aristotle, with its twin, shovel-shaped rudders and rowing benches intact. The vessel bears a sharp resemblance to the ship pictured on the Attic red-figure stamnos known as the Siren Vase, in the British Museum.This kind of archaeology is punishingly expensive (it cost around £100,000 a day to keep the MAP vessels at sea) and there was no scope to conduct detailed excavations. But a marvellous opportunity for further exploration awaits – if philanthropic support can be found – allowing researchers to begin to understand the history of the region more deeply, both in terms of how people in the past coped with changing sea levels, and how they were connected to each other by trade. There will be more wrecks to find, too: Professor Adams has hopes of discovering vessels from the bronze age, even the Neolithic. These stricken ships are unlikely ever to be lifted from the seabed. Well preserved though they are, they are almost certainly too fragile to be moved. But their tantalising secrets await discovery – and with them, a richer, deeper understanding of the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3865687fb7c9d7a287e31b20f6d0ce7700ed585f/68_757_1791_1075/master/1791.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc42083fe29eafda7d4f6106c1b41050","title":"take two our pick of the best jumpers and midi skirts in pictures","story":"From leopard print to pleats and sequins, the unifying factor for this season’s skirts is the length.

Not because of arrogance, or drunkenness, or because he was in a laudanum stupor, or having a romp with a mistress. But just because he forgot. “Absolutely no excuse, oh dear,” he says, apologetic to the point of mortification. “Look in your diary!” he adds, castigating himself. “I should remember an interview with the  – especially for this film.”The film is Peterloo, Mike Leigh’s historical epic about the massacre that took place at St Peter’s Field, Manchester, in 1819, when yeoman cavalry charged a huge crowd of pro-democracy protesters, an event that, as well as being shocking and significant, was also instrumental in the birth of this newspaper.He is Tim McInnerny and he plays the Prince Regent, the dissolute son of George III who became head of state after his father’s insanity made him unfit. Although, to be honest, it is difficult to marry the two. On screen is an obscene, obese, pampered future George IV who, as well as providing some darkly comic relief, horribly encapsulates everything that is wrong with society in Regency Britain – absolute power, inherited wealth, a metropolitan elite that doesn’t know, or care, that people in other parts of the country are going without a voice or food (you don’t have to search hard to find modern parallels in Peterloo). And here – admittedly in an eccentric private members club in central London – is this modestly dressed, thoughtful man (he does a lot of pausing and erm-ing before speaking) who has dashed guiltily from his Holborn flat, politely asked for a black americano, and then muttered that some humble pie would be good, too.He is pretty unrecognisable, but certainly not bad in the sense he meant. Quite the opposite, in fact, although it might be over-egging it to say that McInnerny steals the show when he isn’t in very much of it. But the last of his three scenes – in which he shares a tiny sofa with Bailey, who feeds him sugared jellies as he is informed of the events in Manchester – is one of the film’s grisly lingering images.He put a lot of research into the part, read a lot of books (“all of which are completely contradictory”), made 50 foolscap (foolscap!) pages of notes and wandered around London marvelling at his character’s imprint on the capital. Then, rehearsing with Leigh for eight hours a day, the pair worked out how the Prince Regent walked and talked, building the character together.McInnerny, 62, borrowed from real people in his own life. “Preferably not famous people, but Mike did allow me a little latitude with that because he said you are playing a prince so it is kind of appropriate that some of them are famous, who might be useful to use as sort of background fodder. I won’t say who those people are.”Oh go on, why not? “Because … they’re not necessarily going to want to be associated with the Prince Regent,” he laughs. “Think of … ha ha ha, I don’t know … tall, overweight, intelligent people of my generation.” Ah-ha, and who you might have worked with early in your career? “Indeed, yes, and we’ll stop right there.” Who could he mean? Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Miranda Richardson … none of them quite fits. Who could it be, I wonder? Whoever, McInnerny is keen to point out his prince is a mixture of many people, including contradictory versions culled from different biographies, lots of non-famous people, and a bit of himself too.McInnerny was in Blackadder, of course, as Captain Darling in the fourth series, and – more memorably still – as Lord Percy in the first two. Foppish fool, alchemist, discoverer of “green” (a tiny bit like gold, but worthless and a different colour). McInnerny stopped doing Percy because he didn’t think there was anywhere else to go with it, plus he wanted to avoid being typecast as a toff. He hasn’t entirely succeeded a decade on from Blackadder, playing nice Max in Notting Hill cemented his social standing in many minds. “I suppose whatever is most successful becomes what people think of as your trademark,” he says.In truth, he isn’t very posh. Born in Cheadle Hulme, in Cheshire, his father was a civil servant attached to the RAF and got moved around sites looking after transport for the Ministry of Defence. A lot of his childhood was spent in Stroud, Gloucestershire, which is where his mother was from. “We were in accommodation that was rented by the civil service, so it was kind of a civil service version of a council house and, you know, six kids, dad went to work on a bike, not posh at all, upwardly mobile lower-middle class.” His mother insisted that they spoke RP and, because the family travelled around so much, McInnerny did not pick up any accent. He has a neutral voice, which is useful as an actor, he says. “I have a very good ear and can pick up anything when I’m allowed to not play solicitors,” he adds, perhaps with just a touch of sadness.There have been many, varied roles in theatre, film and television. He was the voice of Renault for a while, and acted in a pop video for Kate Bush, a hero of his. A couple of years ago, he was in the brilliant Channel 4 Operation Yewtree-inspired drama National Treasure (“pleasingly difficult, and you thought: this is why I became an actor”). And he was Robett Glover in the past two seasons of Game of Thrones, which allowed him to be bitter and bearded (although still a noble). It all tends to come back to Percy. At one charity do McInnerny was at, a woman turned up with her own “green” (actually, her child’s plasticine) that she wanted to be photographed with Percy.McInnerny knew Leigh socially but had never been directed by him before, and he says that working with him was an eye-opener in terms of the level of investment required. “When you meet him for a role, what goes through your head is, ‘This is not going to be like any other way of working you’ve ever done before,’ not to the same extent anyway. So I thought: ‘If I don’t do this, if I find some way of talking myself out of this, then I will never be able to call myself a proper actor, basically.’”Even after he started he had doubts about doing “this proper work”. “Instead of which, he invests you with a great deal of faith. Once you’ve been given the job, it’s like: ‘Well, of course I can do this because otherwise he wouldn’t have chosen you.’ It’s a wonderful thing.”Mostly he is proud of the film because it is a history lesson that is not taught in school. “Why are we talking about all these great kings and queens but we’re not told how these ordinary people having a legal protest, without any weapons, were cut down with swords? It’s kind of extraordinary. I think a lot of people won’t believe it happens in this country.”Even now? “I think it’s saying there are lessons to be learned. I don’t know the kettling of marchers can lead to violence. Things get out of control very quickly if you don’t respond in a human way.” He says actors can be pleased with their work, “but it’s very rare to feel proud of being in something and that it is important. That’s how I feel about Peterloo.”McInnerny describes himself as a “romantic socialist”. The current government isn’t a government: “If the Labour party could get their act together, they could walk all over them.” Corbyn is an honourable man, he says, but not statesmanlike, and there have been too many missed opportunities. Brexit is “embarrassing and shameful”, he says. “As far as I can tell, the economics of it doesn’t work, but also culturally, it’s like we’re happy to be parochial, are we? It’s the opposite of what I try to do in my job.”He wasn’t on the People’s Vote march last weekend, because he was on his way back from filming, otherwise he would have been. He had been in Northern Ireland, not for Game of Thrones but for a murder mystery for Channel 5. He hasn’t been in Game of Thrones since series six. There was no violent death, no explanation, just no call from HBO about which he’s a bit cross. “It’s kind of disrespectful,” he says. “Not just to me, but to the audience. It’s like nobody will notice Lord Glover has fallen off the edge of the world.”It is time for photos, in the alley outside. “I haven’t been able to do my normal cosmetic preparations,” he says, joking I think, before apologising, again, for being late. “Flaky fucking actors,” he mutters.Even that is not the end of it. Later, an email arrives, further apologies from the Prince Regent. OK, you’re forgiven, this time.

It’s time they explored male vulnerability, tooAutumn: season of mists, mellow fruitfulness and the final girl, a lone female survivor triumphing over the masked killer who has butchered her friends. This isn’t a spoiler for the new Halloween film, because we all know that this final girl – the slasher movie archetype incarnated by Jamie Lee Curtis in her early horror roles and first identified by Carol J Clover in her 1992 book Men, Women, and Chainsaws – will survive. She is the last woman standing and always outlives the rest.Unless, of course, the trope is being subverted. But the fact that it can be subverted emphasises how much the final girl is embedded in culture. Her behaviour and sexuality have been analysed, horror films have even been named after her (2015’s Final Girl), but there is one question no one seems to ask. Where are all the final boys?They are there, but you have to dig a bit. There is Chris in Get Out, who manages to turn the tables on his abusers, just as Paxton emerges from Hostel intact, give or take a couple of fingers. Brent gets his feet nailed to the floor, but manages to escape before his captors lobotomise him in The Loved Ones. Mark dodges Death itself in Dario Argento’s Inferno, although you can be sure it will catch up with him in the end, the way it nails Alex, who survives all the way through Final Destination, only for the sequel to reveal that he was later brained, offscreen, by a falling brick. MacReady and Childs make it to the end of The Thing without being infected (or do they? Although heaven knows how long they wll last in those sub-zero temperatures): this is a film that would have had trouble drumming up a final girl since there aren’t any girls in it.And there is a list of quasi-final boys in everything from Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now to Hereditary, in which a male character seems poised to survive – only to fall victim to a last-minute ironic twist.You could almost think men are in danger being erased from the annals of survivors as horror becomes increasingly feminised. “The strongest audience for horror, traditionally the bastion of young males, is now younger females,” Screen Daily reported earlier this year. But although final girls outnumber the boys, it is worth remembering that, before the heroine can triumph, we first have to share in her being threatened and abused. Could it be that film-makers and audiences feel more comfortable with this type of treatment meted out to female characters rather than male ones? How often have you heard men screaming or begging for their lives in horror movies? But if it is rare to see male characters terrorised on screen, perhaps this is because it conflicts with preconceived notions of masculinity.Men are supposed to be pillars of strength, not snivelling victims – that’s the stuff of comedy not horror. Where it is thought noteworthy when women fight back, being the final boy is just business as usual – men are expected to kick ass. Think of Arnie in Predator, Bruce Willis in Die Hard, or James Bond or Jason Bourne defeating aliens or megavillains to emerge as the last man standing.It could be that male directors prefer to terrorise women as a form of surrogate sexual domination – a way to put them in their place. “If they have a good face or figure I would much prefer to watch them being murdered than an ugly girl or man,” Argento once said. The same goes for Carrie director Brian de Palma, who said: “You fear more for her than you would for a husky man.” But this says more about the film-makers than about horror.The French director Pascal Laugier, best known for torturing his heroine to death in the 2008 psychological thriller Martyrs, admits that the bond between the two sisters who are comprehensively abused and tormented in his latest film, Incident in a Ghostland, was inspired by the relationship he had with his brother. So why didn’t he make the characters male? “Male characters pull me back into a sort of realism that I naturally try to escape from, whereas female characters instantly slot into the sort of storytelling that interests me,” he said.To which I say – try harder. Anyone can terrorise girls, but it is far more powerful to explore precisely what it is that makes film-makers so reluctant to put male characters through the wringer, as Belgian director Fabrice Du Welz did in Calvaire, in which the protagonist is abducted, forcibly dressed in a frock, and sexually abused before he manages to flee his attackers. One of horror’s abiding strengths is the way it allows film-makers and audiences to plumb those parts of the psyche into which mainstream genres dare not go, so surely the limits of masculine identity would be a rich and potentially illuminating seam to mine?Just as feminism is as much about liberating men from traditional, restrictive notions of masculinity as it is about furthering the cause of women themselves, it might be useful, even healthy, for more horror films to explore the vulnerability of male characters as well as female ones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f6aa2ae03dc6b6c6f17c462e3ba0ff9bf28931/0_21_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d2797f88b2d55fb56e7e4a6b9e539c","title":"the forgotten cinemas of baltimore in pictures","story":"Since the 1890s, the city in Maryland has been home to more than 240 cinemas and while many of these buildings have survived, only a few of them still show films.

It is a manager’s job to nitpick and he found imperfections in the performance of Ruben Lotus-Cheek, who scored all three goals as Chelsea sauntered to victory over Bate Borisov.The result leaves Chelsea well on course for the next stage of the Europe League, with maximum points from their three group games but Sarri suggested Loftus-Cheek is still some way off a regular place in the first team, although he is at least getting closer.The England midfielder has been frustrated at being restricted to 33 minutes of Premier League action this season and began as one of eight alterations to the lineup who began Saturday’s draw with Manchester United. “He is improving,” Sarri said. “I told him at the beginning of the season he is a very good player and I think now maybe he is becoming more suitable to my football.“In the offensive phase he was wonderful but I think he needs to improve the defensive phase. But not only him. We have four midfielders for two positions and three of them have the same characteristics.”“It’s a very difficult tactical problem to solve without an improvement in the defensive phase. We need to work.”Loftus-Cheek indicated he is willing to do exactly that. “The first thing is to train well and as hard as I can. Keep the good habits, eat well and sleep well and if I keep doing that the chances will come,” he said.While Sarri wants Loftus-Cheek to do better when not in possession, he could have no quibble with what the 22-year-old did with the ball. It took him less than two minutes to open the scoring. Davide Zappacosta scurried down the right and aimed a low cross towards the penalty spot, where Loftus-Cheek was free to sweep it into the net for his first goal of the season.He claimed his second six minutes later, redirecting Willian’s outswinging corner into the net from the edge of the six-yard box. He completed his hat-trick nine minutes into the second half, guiding a side-foot effort from the edge of the area past a feeble e by the goalkeeper. That brought a delighted reaction from the home crowd, who serenaded their academy graduate with chants of “he’s one of our own”.Amid the celebrations Marco Ianni, the coach who riled José Mourinho on Saturday, sat in the dugout, on his best behaviour.The cheers from the crowd grew louder on the hour, when the gifted 17-year-old Callum Hudson-Odoi was introduced for his first appearance of the season. It was all great fun for the home side until, much to Sarri’s annoyance, Chelsea’s intensity sagged and Bate were allowed to score a late goal. Aleksei Rios crept in unnoticed at the back post to turn in a free-kick from Igor Stasevich.That sort of sloppiness has infected Chelsea’s otherwise excellent performances under Sarri and he has expressed a determination to eradicate it.For all that the outcome was never in doubt. Bate may be on course for a 13th consecutive domestic title but they had nowhere near enough quality to threaten a first defeat on Sarri in his 13th competitive match in charge of Chelsea.The Belarusian club’s only previous trip to London – to Arsenal last year – had ended in a 6-0 thrashing and for a while a repeat of that scoreline looked likely.Aleksandr Hleb, the 37-year-old in the heart of their midfield, had joked in the buildup about how much he was looking forward to renewing acquaintances with Cesc Fàbregas, quipping he would take this opportunity to land a sneaky punch on his former Arsenal teammate. But Bate seldom got within touching distance off the home side, and once Loftus-Cheek landed the first blow the contest was over.Several other Chelsea players had chances to join Loftus-Cheek on the scoresheet. Pedro had a shot deflected just wide, while a header from Gary Cahill was cleared off the line and Kovacic stabbed wide from close range.William was a constant delight, except when he overhit a pass that would have put Olivier Giroud clean through. Giroud was later denied by a superb one-handed save by Denis Scherbitski."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a431972a58b7cef14b25a381836efe21cdfbe97f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29c38ef1cacb7f67c2ecacf28771d167","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Mesut Özil has earned his stripes, Jürgen Locadia must step up for Brighton and when will José Mourinho give Fred a chance?While José Mourinho continues to make ever-so-subtle digs about the quality of his squad, it is worth remembering that Manchester United have had a £52m midfielder sitting on their bench in recent weeks. There was plenty of excitement when they signed Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk in the summer but the Brazil international has not been given many opportunities to demonstrate his abilities. He has been a substitute since scoring on his last start – the 1-1 home draw with Wolves – and must be wondering what he has to do earn a place in Mourinho’s starting 11. Nemanja Matic struggled again during the midweek defeat to Juventus and looked cumbersome during last weekend’s draw with Chelsea. Perhaps Mourinho should consider giving Fred a chance to develop a relationship with Paul Pogba when United host Everton on Sunday. JS• How well has Mourinho spent money at Manchester United?• Mourinho denies FA charge of using offensive languageUnai Emery’s Arsenal revolution has been built on a series of minor tweaks, slotting players into different positions to create a deep, versatile squad capable of consistency in the league and in Europe. One player who has had to adapt more than most is Mesut Özil, shifted from one wing to the other in the Premier League before Monday’s home win over Leicester. Returned to the No10 role and given the captain’s armband, Özil struggled until a goal just before half-time sparked a breathtaking inidual and collective second-half display. He has surely earned the right to continue as the team’s creative linchpin at Selhurst Park, where Palace are yet to score at home this season. The challenge for Özil and Arsenal will be to unpick a stubborn home defence and extend the visitors’ winning run to 12 games. NM• Welbeck pounces to give Arsenal Europa League win over Sporting• Are Arsenal genuine contenders for the Premier League title?Cardiff have played Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham and now face Liverpool, but after this game they face none of the current top six and five members of the current bottom half before Spurs visit on New Year’s Day. Indeed, the way Cardiff’s fixtures have fallen has left them with two particularly difficult periods, one from which they will emerge after Saturday, the other falling inconveniently at the end of the season, when their final seven fixtures include games against Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Manchester United. Being out of the bottom three – thanks largely to last weekend’s 4-2 win over Fulham – is significantly ahead of rational expectation and leaves Neil Warnock’s side looking ahead with optimism to the possibility a relatively enjoyable, bookmaker-confounding few months. Once they get this potentially morale-shattering fixture out of the way, of course. SB• Quiz: who are the Premier League top goalscorers by country?With Andriy Yarmolenko likely to miss the rest of the season after suffering an achilles injury during last weekend’s defeat to Tottenham, West Ham’s squad is starting to look stretched. Losing the Ukrainian winger is a blow for Manuel Pellegrini, especially with Felipe Anderson flitting in and out of form and Marko Arnautovic struggling to shake off a knee injury. Candidates to fill Yarmolenko’s spot on the right for Saturday evening’s trip to Leicester City include Michail Antonio and Robert Snodgrass and it will not be a surprise if Pellegrini opts for experience. But perhaps West Ham’s manager will be brave enough to give Grady Diangana another opportunity. While the 20-year-old winger is yet to start a Premier League game, he impressed in the crushing Carabao Cup win over Macclesfield Town last month and Pellegrini introduced the rookie instead of Antonio when Yarmolenko collapsed against Tottenham. JS• David Squires on ... Usain Bolt’s comic-book football adventureThere will be plenty of creative talent on show at Wembley on Monday night, with Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne expected to start. Both returning playmakers will hope the pitch survives an NFL trampling the day before, but if a more direct approach is required, City may have a valuable weapon in Aymeric Laporte. The French centre-back has earned praise for his left-footed, long-range distribution to either flank, and also weighs in with the odd headed goal. City have conceded just once in their last seven games, when Laporte was switched to left-back against Hoffenheim. At centre-back, he has been imperious, tightening Guardiola’s defence and making the leaders almost as tough to break down as they are to keep out at the other end. NM• De Bruyne concerned about playing Spurs at Wembley after NFL game• Guardiola rushed to Manchester Arena to find family after terror attack• Spurs’ academy is succeeding thanks to locally sourced players• Tottenham’s Vorm says: ‘We had to kill PSV game. We know that’This could be a pivotal moment in Jürgen Locadia’s career at Brighton. While Glenn Murray has an outside chance of being passed fit to face Wolves at the Amex Stadium on Saturday afternoon, the expectation is that the veteran striker will be ruled out of contention after suffering a concussion in last weekend’s victory over Newcastle. Chris Hughton is likely to turn to Locadia if that proves to be the case and the Dutch forward, who has not scored since February, will need to make sure that he is ready for a difficult test. Brighton, who are looking for their third consecutive win, rely heavily on Murray for their goals and Locadia has not convinced since his £14m move from PSV Eindhoven in January. This would be a good time for the 24-year-old to end his barren run. JS• Football Weekly Extra: defensive rocks to dazzling DortmundThere might not be much positivity in the air when Southampton host Newcastle on Saturday afternoon. On the one hand, Newcastle’s wretched history in this fixture – one point from their last five visits, conceding 15 goals – means their long-suffering fans will expect the worst on their way to the south coast. An increasingly gloomy Rafael Benítez has already said that Newcastle need to find three worse teams in order to escape relegation, but despite the worrying statistics, his side will regard this as a fine opportunity to earn their first win of the season. Southampton have gone four league games without a goal, sit a point above the bottom three, , and their worries will increase if they cannot muster any ruthlessness against the ision’s bottom side. JS• Belgium top Fifa rankings while win in Spain lifts England to fifthBournemouth have made a strong start, tucked in behind the runaway top five, but there is still room for improvement – particularly in front of goal. Eddie Howe’s side have averaged an impressive 12 shots per game so far this season, but are statistically among the league’s most wasteful sides, with striker Callum Wilson particularly guilty of profligacy. They put just two of their nine shots on target in the stalemate with Southampton, and fired 14 efforts wide of goal in the 4-0 defeat to Burnley. By contrast, Bournemouth put four past both Watford and Leicester despite creating less chances than their opponents, showing what they can do when their collective eye is in. Fulham’s porous defence will surely offer up plenty of chances on Saturday – the trick is taking them. NM• Europa League roundup: Celtic lose at Leipzig, Milan beaten by BetisIn their last home game Watford were routed 4-0 by Bournemouth, and with those memories still fresh their next visitors are walking reminders of a similarly disastrous performance last December, which ended with Huddersfield winning 4-1. “Last year it was a good game for the team and for me as well,” said Florent Depoitre, whose goal at Vicarage Road was his fourth of last season – there have been two more in 27 league appearances since. “It was a really big win for us, so I am hoping we can repeat the scenario. We need to get points now.” Watford are a different proposition this season under Javi Gracia, and despite failing to win any of their last five games before last week’s 2-0 success at Wolves have performed admirably in every fixture except one having also lost at Huddersfield last season, they have a score to settle here. SBChelsea have not lost in any competition since the Community Shield, while Burnley have won only twice in 16 matches this season, and last week fell 5-0 at Manchester City. But a perfect illustration of football’s unpredictability can be found in the game played between these teams on this weekend nearly a century ago, in 1921. On that occasion Burnley were the overwhelming favourites: they were league leaders and reigning champions, while a week earlier Chelsea had lost 5-0 – to Burnley. That was the ninth victory in the Clarets’ first 11 games of the season while their opponents had won just once, and Jack Cock had scored every one of Chelsea’s humble tally of six goals. But despite it all the Londoners, said the , “astonished everybody by their performance”, winning 4-1. “On the face of it there could be only one result,” wrote the Observer, but “Chelsea obliged their many supporters, some of whom had almost given them up, by giving Burnley a really good hiding.” (Unpredictability was all the rage: on the same weekend Aston Villa, beaten 5-0 at Middlesbrough the week before, thumped the same opponents 6-2 while Manchester United, who had gone down 4-1 at Manchester City, prevailed 3-1.) So, in short, it’s a funny old game.

In our earliest months, we respond to facial gestures and tone of voice, smiling our gummy smiles at those who grin at us. As we get older we forge friendships and learn to socialise. A gathering or coming together of family members or pals will, for many, hold happy memories of laughter shared and stories swapped over meals.It can be easy to forget the power of a face-to-face conversation or the comfort of a hug when we increasingly live our lives online. But emojis, gifs and texts can’t replace the feelgood factor of connecting offline and what that can do for our happiness and wellbeing.Packed schedules and the frantic pace of modern life can take their toll. Increasingly, it has become harder to draw the line, with emails pinging in at all times of the day. Mealtimes have suffered – with hastily grabbed lunches wolfed down in front of screens and Netflix dinners taken side by side.But a lunch break should be exactly that – a break – especially since taking time out has been proved to boost focus and concentration. Ditching your desk lunch to eat with workmates is an easy way to feel refreshed, rejuvenated and more productive, as well as being a chance to make meaningful connections and get to know your colleagues better. Similarly, simply switching off the TV, laying the table and asking your family or flatmates about their day over some shared food – and perhaps even a glass of wine – can be transformative, both for your relationships and your wellbeing.Socialising and food go hand in hand for Maider Lizoain, 22, who moved from the Basque country in northern Spain to London to study for her master’s. She speaks fondly of the annual saint feast days held in her hometown. Here, music, massive lunches and merriment abound, as locals gather in the squares to cook together in a joyous, colourful atmosphere. “Family gatherings are a big thing too,” she says. “People have lunch with the whole family every Sunday … My grandpa is from Valencia, so he always cooks paella when we gather.”Bringing the tradition to London, get-togethers with classmates saw Lizoain cook up tortilla: “It’s a typical dish from home and everybody abroad loves it.” As well as being a fun way to connect, dinner parties would give her new friends an opportunity to share a taste of their cultures. “Each person would bring some food or drink. Since we were from different countries, it was a very interesting thing to do,” she explains.Of course, connecting with a new group can be a nerve-racking experience, with a fear of rejection often holding us back when meeting new people. Which is why people find joining groups based on hobbies or interests to be a brilliant way of socialising a common interest can break the ice and sharing a passion makes conversation flow much more easily.For Heather Jones, 31, joining a 20s-30s book club when she first moved to south London worked out not only as a great way to delve into her love of reading, but also as a handy opportunity to make friends locally. Ten years on, she counts many of them as some of her most treasured pals. Their literary meet-ups are still going strong, although they’ve moved away from the library and set up their own book club, favouring gathering at each other’s homes or at a pub instead. “We have a bottle of wine, some food and a catch up,” she says. “We talk about a book that we’ve all read, but really it’s nice to have updates on their lives.”Gathering together around a table to share food and drink has, for centuries, kept people close: from cosy family dinners to clinking glasses of wine at a special occasion. Taking the time to ensure it is a tradition preserved is well worth a moment away from our digital lives.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes. It won’t be any worse for it.Best paired with …With its crisp, fresh flavours, white fruit aromas and delicate stream of bubbles, a glass of perfectly chilled Cava Brut Reserva makes an ideal accompaniment to the sharply-sweet flavours of rhubarb charlotte.Made for sharingSharing is in the vines at Campo Viejo.

As the channel finally airs the show in full, the man responsible fesses upThere’s a vast crowd heaving before the Pyramid stage, dusk is turning into night and some shadowy figures have slipped behind their instruments and started to play space-jazz. Here is the culmination of Glastonbury 2000, the millennium festival’s final act, and, for a moment, everything hangs in the balance. Since 1995, David Bowie has released Outside, Earthling and Hours – each sprinkled with the odd cracking song but all grasping rather desperately for the zeitgeist. Bowie’s 53 now, and although he has toured relentlessly throughout the preceding decade, this isn’t his arena or his production. He’s out on a limb and he could fail in front of all these people and the million or more watching on BBC Two …This was the BBC’s fourth year of filming the festival and I was – as I remain – the overall producer of the coverage. The festival was wilder then, before the wall was built in 2002, and we’d survived two of its wettest years in 1997 and 98. We were determined to make Glastonbury’s headline sets required viewing. We’d had Moby on Friday and Travis on Saturday, but the whole narrative of the festival was built around Bowie. However, there was a problem: Bowie really didn’t want to be filmed.The first time I’d met Bowie, he’d been performing on Later … with Jools Holland opposite Oasis in 1995. Oasis were in their messy pomp and although Liam had been on a three-day bender, lost his voice in rehearsal and didn’t appear, Oasis still opened the show. Meanwhile, Bowie was notably skittish when he chatted at the piano with Jools, as if in horror of being pinned down. He was back on Later… in December 1999, opening the show with Ashes to Ashes while promoting Hours, but none of these brief encounters helped when it came to Glastonbury 2000.Weeks of wrangling, cajoling, even pleading through Bowie’s publicist, Alan Edwards, had resulted in an amiable but immovable stalemate. We could film and broadcast the first four songs of the set and then a song or two from the encore, but no more. We spent an hour’s buildup on BBC Two that night with sets from Embrace and Kelis and a short film in which Billy Bragg brought the then editor of the Spectator, Boris Johnson, to Glastonbury. We had Bowie’s astonishing, hit-laden setlist in our hands by this point and the crowd were chanting “Bowie! Bowie!”At just after 10pm, Bowie appeared on a backstage camera, looking nervous but determined. Moments later, he was on stage, sporting a three-quarter-length Alexander McQueen frock coat, wonderfully wide Oxford bags and long hair swept to the side a la Veronica Lake. Where had I seen this outfit before? It struck me there and then, that Bowie was referencing his own performance at this very same spot almost 30 years earlier, and that he looked just as groundbreakingly beautiful and “gay” now as he did back then. For all his reputation as one of rock’s great shape-shifters, Bowie had decided to headline Glastonbury as … himself! He launched into Station to Station’s Wild Is the Wind, then China Girl, and already the nerves were gone and he was visibly beginning to enjoy himself. He followed it with Changes, a song he’d debuted at that 1971 Worthy Farm appearance as the sun was rising. We were only three songs in and the crowd were already eating out of Bowie’s hand.Bowie had not been one for playing greatest-hits sets, but that night it was clear he’d come to reclaim his legend. And as Edwards and I began watching the set in director Janet Fraser-Crook’s scanner, it was obvious we were heading for a broadcasting disaster if we cut it short.I persuaded Edwards to accompany me to the edge of the Pyramid stage, where he would try and get a word to David via Coco Schwab, his legendary assistant. The set was so clearly going to be a resounding triumph, that surely – surely – this had to be shared with the watching nation? We stood there watching Changes and some of the fourth song, Stay, but there was only a shake of the head from Coco and no sidelong glance from the stage, where Bowie and band were riding high. At least these shenanigans bought our broadcast one more song assistant producer Alison Howe was charged with staying with the set until I returned to the BBC Two scanner, and so we shared a fifth song – which just happened to be Life on Mars?I rushed back into the BBC Two scanner moments before the end of Life on Mars? and had to explain to the presenter, Jamie Theakston, that we were coming off Bowie. I should have asked him to explain to the nation that it had been insisted upon by the artist himself. But naively I didn’t want to blame Bowie: it was the early days of our coverage and I hadn’t yet reasoned that the audience’s expectation of a Glastonbury headliner no longer sat with the artist but with the BBC.Unfortunately we had nothing to screen that might remotely explain why we were coming off the great man in full flow. To the viewers, it seemed as though it was the BBC’s editorial decision. Jamie sat there by the campfire and – clearly smart enough not to take the hit – proceeded to read out the entire setlist. Which we wouldn’t be broadcasting … “I am not sure I’m supposed to do this,” he announced, before running through hit after hit while the sound of Absolute Beginners wafted over from the Pyramid stage.Jamie promised to bring “an encore or two” from Bowie’s set later on, but that was nearly 90 minutes away. Basement Jaxx weren’t on yet, neither were Ozomatli. And anyway, how could any other band replace Bowie in his pomp? In the end, Jamie introduced a short film exploring the world of underground theatre at Glastonbury, which culminated in Jools accompanying Michael Eavis on some Elvis gospel from the Rabbit Hole. It was bizarre and inexplicable and, if I had been a viewer, unforgivable.Meanwhile Bowie’s set progressed, constantly scaling new heights. The frock coat came off early but the intensity just kept on growing. At one point he told the crowd: “This is so cool for us, it really is cool – I fucking love it!”As we were providing images for the huge stage screens, we rolled the tapes so that at least the footage of the show would exist. Meanwhile, our broadcast staggered on. We went back to Embrace and played their post-Oasis anthem All You Good Good People. We joined Basement Jaxx on the Other Stage, left when they suffered a power cut and returned to Jamie to explain what had happened. We returned to Basement Jaxx, we joined Ozomatli, we went back to Basement Jaxx. Finally, just after 11.30pm, as per our agreement, we rejoined Bowie for two encores, Ziggy Stardust and “Heroes”. Wonderful, but too little and much too late.I spent the next two weeks writing to viewers who complained about us not showing more – or all – of Bowie’s set. Since then I’ve often tried to persuade his management to let us screen more of that night’s performance. There were mutterings about audio quality, about some aspects of the performance, but I think the great man already had at least half an eye on posterity.Of course, Glastonbury 2000 wasn’t Bowie’s last show, far from it. There were the massive Heathen and A Reality tours and then the heart attack on 24 June 2004 in Germany that effectively drove him from the concert stage. Bowie then all but disappeared for a decade, until those final two albums and the brilliantly orchestrated occasion of his passing in January 2016 when, once again, he took centre stage.These days, headliners have largely come to believe that sharing their whole set live on BBC Two is part of the attraction of playing Glastonbury, that they want to embrace the occasion and play to the world. Some knock it out of the park, some less so. But I think Bowie knew exactly what he was doing on the night of 25 June 2000. He wasn’t about to give away his peak performance or his catalogue for nothing. He hoarded that night so that one day it could be shown in all its glory as his legacy, the culmination of his golden years and surely his greatest concert since he buried Ziggy Stardust at Hammersmith in July 1973. It’s a time capsule of his life, ready to be shared with us now that the stars have aligned.

We lower our tariffs, the EU doesn’t lower theirs,” said Martin Haworth, director of strategy at the NFU.Arla Foods, which works as a co-operative, sells the produce of one in four British farms.“No deal would not be good for anyone, nobody is benefiting, the supply chain would be broken down the middle with tariffs and non-tariff barriers like extra documentation adding further costs,” said Giørtz-Carlsen.Doherty told the conference that exports of the parts of carcasses that British consumers reject, such as bone and offal, are a key part of the farmer’s business model."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1067e4689b929c7ad2e5cb343f879f7a41c7546/0_460_1489_893/master/1489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8044cd3f5cef430751729f10269375d1","title":"recording of mothers voice more effective than smoke alarm study finds","story":"Sleeping children three times more likely to wake to voice recording than to loud beeping, research findsIt’s every parent’s worst nightmare: there’s a fire in the house, the alarms are beeping, but the children are sleeping on oblivious. Now scientists say they have found a better way to rouse slumbering youngsters.Researchers in the US have discovered that playing a child a recording of their mother’s voice is about three times more likely to wake them than a traditional alarm. What’s more, it does so faster and is linked to a quicker escape.The team say the research supports a smaller study previously conducted by the group, but reveals that using the child’s name does not make a difference to the effectiveness of the voice alarm. Smith said the team now want to explore whether a voice other than the child’s mother can be just as effective, or if the gender of the voice matters.“If we can get something that can be generically developed and just taken straight out of the packet and is effective for children in this age range then that is our goal,” he said.While one alarm featured a high-pitched beep – the sort commonly found in households – the other three featured the voice of the child’s mother calling either the child’s name, giving instructions such as: “Wake up! Leave the room!”, or both.Each child slept in a lab-based room that resembled a real bedroom, and were shown how to escape from the room before they went to bed. The children were also kitted out with electrodes, allowing the team to make sure that the alarm was sounded when the children were at the same sleep stage each time.The children were each asked to sleep at the lab on two occasions, and were woken up twice with alarms each time, meaning each experienced all four alarms – the order of which was chosen randomly.In addition, the children shook off their slumbers faster, with a median value of two seconds for the voice alarm, regardless of which words were used, compared with more than two and a half minutes for the traditional alarm. Similarly, escape times were longer in the cases of the beeping alarms.Rick Hylton of the National Fire Chiefs Council welcomed the study, but said people should not worry about how effective their current alarms are.“We know smoke alarms save lives. They will alert occupants early, if working, fitted and installed in the correct location. This gives adults, parents or s the opportunity to wake children and leave the house,” he said, adding that children should also be shown an escape plan.Prof Niamh Nic Daéid, director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee, said the research backed up work by her team that found a human voice combined with a low-frequency pulsing tone was far more effective in waking children than a traditional high-pitched alarm.But she noted that the latest study involved children sleeping in a location other than their own bedroom, which might have made them more receptive to an alarm, while more work was needed to explore whether other familiar sounds, such as a dog barking, might also prove effective in rousing children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97b474252a23b496d7cb295479bd9ec86ed6c53e/0_202_3586_2151/master/3586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbc24ac1aa018f825207e1d872a66ba5","title":"story of a nation hs2 rail archaeological dig begins in uks biggest excavation","story":"Early discoveries on 150-mile route are Victorian time capsules and prehistoric toolsArchaeologists on the HS2 rail link between London and Birmingham have begun work on the UK’s biggest ever excavation, cutting an “unprecedented” slice through 10,000 years of British history.The mammoth archaeological project, taking in more than 60 separate digs along the 150-mile route, is the first stage in construction of the controversial rail line ahead of main building works starting next year.The developers have now revealed some of their early finds including a prehistoric hunter-gatherer site on the outskirts of London, a Wars of the Roses battlefield in Northamptonshire, a Romano-British town near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire and an Iron Age settlement in Staffordshire.Their discoveries include prehistoric flint tools, a Romano-British cremation urn and two late Victorian time capsules dug up close to Euston station in London, containing rolled-up newspaper tied with twine, calling cards and leaflets promoting temperance.More than 1,000 archaeologists, bone specialists, scientists and conservators will be working on the sites until 2020, making the excavations the largest archaeological dig ever undertaken in Britain and potentially in Europe, according to Helen Wass, the project’s lead archaeologist.“It’s an unprecedented undertaking certainly there has been nothing in Britain on this scale,” said Wass. “We are really going to be able to tell the story of a nation.”As part of their initial surveys, the developers put together a Lidar (light detection and ranging) map – based on laser scanning – of the entire route, and archaeologists have carried out ground-penetrating geophysical surveys of the equivalent of 14,000 football pitches.At Colne valley, to the west of London, archaeologists have been examining evidence of herds of horses and reindeer which roamed the floodplains during the early Mesolithic period (from 11,000-8,000 BC), and of the humans who occupied the valley continuously from that date until the medieval period.A very different excavation in Fleet Marston, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, has revealed a Romano-British town at the junction of a number of Roman roads. “We have roadways, the remains of buildings, animal enclosures and fence lines,” said Wass, “and you can get a really great picture of how people at that time lived and worked and moved around the country”.In Handsacre in Staffordshire, a dig has uncovered the remains of an iron age house and a pit alignment, thought to have been used as a farming boundary during that period in the same way as hedges are today.And in Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire, the ruins of an Anglo-Saxon church and burial ground will allow scientists and historians to study bodies dating back to the 12th century, to build a picture of the history of the village and its inhabitants over almost 1,000 years.Asked if she had a personal favourite discovery, Wass mentioned the site of the Battle of Edgcote, in Northamptonshire, where the armies of the Earl of Pembroke were defeated in 1469 by a rebel force led by Robin of Redesdale during the Wars of the Roses.“It just looks like a field,” said Wass. “It wasn’t a period of history I knew a huge amount about, but by reading the research that our specialists have undertaken about that time in our history when we were moving towards the Tudors, you have Welsh poets writing about the battle, you have the armies of various people moving across the landscape, and some of those markers are still there today. So that is one of our exciting sites.“But there really is going to be something for everybody, because we do cover the entire range of history.”A battlefield site presents particular challenges, she said. “They are really ephemeral in the landscape, because people just met there for a day, moved across, had combat and went away.” Archaeologists will use metal detectors to hunt for arrowheads and weaponry, while there is a slim chance of burials on the edges of the battlefield.“But you’re just trying to look for something that can validate the written sources that we have, that are obviously hundreds of years old. If we find arrowheads of the day, or weaponry of the day, or pieces of armoury, that helps us really pin down what people were writing about. Because obviously history was generally written by the victors, so they might have a particular spin on the battle. So are they telling the truth?”In Birmingham, excavations include exploration of the 19th century Park Street burial ground on what will be the site of the new HS2 Curzon Street station, which the archaeologists say will offer an insight into a period when the city’s population grew tenfold in the Industrial Revolution.At the other end of the line, another burial ground at St James’s gardens, next to Euston station, is expected to be the largest archaeological excavation of human remains from 18th and 19th century Britain.The cemetery, where up to 61,000 people were buried between 1788 and 1853, was the final resting place of both paupers and nobility, including a number of notable names including Captain Matthew Flinders, who completed the first circumnavigation of Australia, and Bill ‘The Terror’ Richmond, a freed slave who was born in New York but came to London and became a famous bare-knuckle boxer who taught Lord Byron to spar.Wass said the project would seek to engage people living along the length of the rail line, offering community events, pop-up museums, apprenticeships and training opportunities at different sites.“We are really trying to engage communities, because I think everybody is very interested in their locality, even if they haven’t been particularly aware, for example, of the Roman site down the road. I think people always want to know who these people were, where they lived, how they lived, how they cooked their food – all those stories that bring our ancestors to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

Ministers must “take decisive action, not more warm words,” he said.He said the government should offer “housing delivery contracts”, where developers sign up to targets for the rate of housebuilding on a site, with fines if these targets are missed.Healey said that would provide much greater power over the speed at which homes are built. Councils only have the power to give or refuse permission to build.Earlier this year, Labour proposed the creation of a new English Sovereign Land Trust, to buy discounted land and allocate it to a range of developers, breaking up the number of big firms on larger sites.Landowners sell at a price that factors in a significant increase in value after obtaining planning consent, meaning a hectare of agricultural land worth £20,000 can sell for closer to £2m if it is zoned for housing. Developers regularly deny using land to speculate, arguing more profit can usually be made from building.Labour is considering a policy to give the Land Trust powers to buy sites at closer to the lower price, by changing the 1961 Land Compensation Act so the state could compulsorily purchase land at a price that excluded the potential for future planning consent.“The chancellor must use the budget to break big developers’ stranglehold over new homes and speed up housebuilding,” Healey said, saying housing was still below pre-crisis levels despite a number of government initiatives.“This means giving councils the power to set tough new rules to ensure homes get built quickly. The number of new social rented homes is stuck at the lowest level since the second world war. We need decisive action, not more warm words from ministers.”Greg Beales, the Shelter housing charity’s director of policy and campaigns, said the UK could not afford to fall behind. “We have become overly reliant on big developers who will only build as fast as they can sell, but many people simply can’t afford the homes they have to offer,” he said. “This has created a massive logjam, which can only be unblocked if we bring down the cost of land and start building the social homes which people actually need.”The former cabinet minister Oliver Letwin is chairing a review of land banking, which Shelter said it hoped would recommend strong legislative changes to the Land Compensation Act to bring down the cost of land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b68b399bcca1c267b8bfc2e9b2efbca02dc1a2/461_202_4520_2712/master/4520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2518f5559663807889ceed8e8555deb5","title":"england captains dylan hartley owen farrell south africa autumn internationals","story":"• We are usually pretty aligned, adds roommate Owen Farrell• England busy at Algarve camp in advance of South Africa TestOwen Farrell says he will run out holding hands with his fellow England co-captain Dylan Hartley if required and insists there is no risk of mixed messages when the pair start their new job-sharing arrangement at Twickenham next week.With Hartley having missed the summer tour to South Africa – where Farrell led the team to a 2-1 series defeat – the head coach, Eddie Jones, has already joked about them emerging from the tunnel hand in hand to face the Springboks. Farrell is not yet ruling that out – “maybe, it might be an option” – and believes the two friends, who are regular roommates on away trips, will prove a natural fit.The Northampton hooker and the Saracens fly-half have not yet had a chance to sit down and fully establish how certain on-day duties will be ided but Farrell is adamant that, tactically, the pair already speak with one voice.“It fits into what we’ve been doing pretty seamlessly anyway,” Farrell said, talking for the first time about the new arrangement. “I don’t think we’re too precious about it. If there is something that pops up, we’re close enough and honest enough to bring it up. I don’t think there would be anything too awkward if either of us had a problem. We see it working to our benefit more than anything.”Neither Farrell nor Hartley had a huge amount of advance warning before Jones revealed the new leadership structure at the squad announcement last week but the former is adamant there will be no on-field disagreements when, for example, there is a choice between kicking to the corner or taking three points.“It doesn’t work like that,” Farrell said. “They are joint decisions anyway. There can be a debate before you come up with a decision, but it’s not a case of ‘I want to do this’ and ‘I want to do that’.“There might be times when we have to think about it a bit more but we’ve been on the same page for a long time. We are usually pretty aligned, probably because of the amount of conversation we have off the field. I guess that’s a pretty important thing going into this.”Whoever calls the shots, Farrell hopes England have learned the lessons of their series defeat in South Africa in June, when their only victory came in the final Test in Cape Town after losses in Johannesburg and Bloemfontein.“We probably learnt a lot in South Africa,” Farrell said. “The main bit for me is what we did in terms of sticking together. We weren’t going in separate directions, we were getting better together and learning from what was going on.”With the Boks having twice ruffled New Zealand in recent weeks, England’s challenge is to rise above the loss of several key forwards, with the All Blacks also due at Twickenham on 10 November. Preparations in the Algarve before the autumn series are set to crank up this weekend and Farrell accepts a sluggish start against South Africa is out of the question.“We have to make sure we hit the ground running. It’s a lot different now to what it was in the summer. They’ve spent a lot of time together since then but we’re excited about the challenge of the first game. We want to be as prepared as we can be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bebc3d6733e47fb228ca2343d5910f24c32fc22/139_99_3613_2168/master/3613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de8ce44cd140fee0d7f445d99eb8434b","title":"lewis hamilton formula one mexico grand prix max verstappen","story":"• Hamilton needs to finish only seventh in Mexico• Dutch driver targets repeat victoryLewis Hamilton is confident of closing out his fifth Formula One championship on Sunday but faces a real threat from Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who won in Mexico last year.The Mercedes driver has a 70-point lead over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel and needs to finish only seventh to be the champion, while his rival must win to keep his chances alive.Verstappen is brimming with confidence after picking his way through the field from 18th place to finish second at the US Grand Prix and the 21-year-old is confident he can triumph at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.“This is definitely the best chance for me to win out of the last three races,” the Dutchman said. “In qualifying we may not have a chance but in the race we seem to be working well, so I expect this to better than Austin. But Lewis will want to win, so I don’t think that will change anything.”If Hamilton does claim the F1 championship the 33-year-old will have equalled Juan Manuel Fangio’s five titles and will be two behind Michael Schumacher.“I am really enjoying racing, I am here to race, I am here to win, to deliver the championship for the team,” he said. “I choose what I am focussed on, I don’t allow any negativity in. I am on a positive wave at the moment. If there was one point between us it would be a lot more intense but I am a decent amount of points ahead so that does naturally help a little bit but I think it is more the experience.”Last year Hamilton sealed his fourth title in Mexico with ninth place. A crash with Vettel on the opening lap put Hamilton to the back of the field from where he had to fightback to secure the place he needed. It was a nerve-racking race that Hamilton admitted had been “a horrible way to do it, to be honest”.He was unequivocal that he did not expect there to be any poor sportsmanship, given a DNF is likely to be the only thing that prevents him from taking the title.“It has never in my entire racing career come into my mind,” he said. “I feel there is a great respect from drivers. I have not felt any disrespect or negativity from any drivers. Everyone is here to do a their job. I don’t think anyone will taint their own history or future by doing something.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d2ca4f66f8e248447674d63b91471c368a5c27/0_84_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ab7fdb2682b6c688c9f2a633ee8b5e8","title":"tour de france cycling power meters route 2019 team sky","story":"In yet another attempt to make the Tour de France a more open race, which will be seen as a further move to break Team Sky’s domination, the organisers are to push for the abolition of the use of power meters. The ubiquitous device which helps a rider to gauge his effort by recording power output as he rides also “annihilates the glorious uncertainty of sport”, according to the Tour organiser, Christian Prudhomme.It remains unclear whether this will be put in place for the 2019 edition, which looks particularly mountainous and which continues the trend towards fewer and shorter time trials. However, it is actually unlikely that the move will drastically affect Team Sky speaking to Le Monde on Thursday, the defending Tour champion, Geraint Thomas, pointed out that he and his team train so frequently with the devices that they end up riding as much according to physical “feel” as to the readout on their screens.Also with the aim of encouraging aggressive racing, the 2019 Tour will also include more time bonuses on key climbs towards the end of hilly and mountainous stages – in addition to the bonuses on offer at the finishes – while the organisers will lobby the governing body, the UCI, for the intermediate bonuses to be higher than during the 2018 event.That follows the reduction in team size from nine to eight, another step widely seen as an attempt to curb Team Sky but which did little to change the outcome of the 2018 race. The principal beneficiary of the bonuses this year was Thomas, who banked them like a squirrel hoarding nuts for the winter.The 2019 Tour route contains little that will cause sleepless nights for the British team who have dominated six of the last seven races, winning with Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Thomas. The inclusion of a single 27km inidual time trial – there is also a team time trial of similar length – will be mildly frustrating for the Dutch specialist Tom Dumoulin, the more so as its inclusion nine days from the finish, with the heavy mountain work in the Pyrenees and Alps still to come, means the climbers will have ample time to recoup any losses.The questions for Team Sky will revolve less around the route than around their two competing champions: it is unclear whether Thomas will be able to replicate the immense physical and mental effort that it took for him to achieve his best climbing form ever, while Froome will be 34 when the 2019 race starts. The volume of climbing will suit this year’s discovery, LottoNL’s Primoz Roglic, while another open question is how much Dumoulin can improve if he concentrates solely on the Tour, as he said he intends to.On paper, the route is best suited to Froome, simply because of the volume of repeated climbing, which is greater than in any recent Tour, with more ascents over 2,000m and a record 30 major ascents the bulk of the climbing is packed into the final eight days’ racing between the time trial in Pau and the summit finish on the final Saturday at the Val Thorens ski resort.Pau also provides the route for La Course, the women’s race run alongside the men’s Tour since 2014. There is no hint of it becoming a true equivalent of the men’s Tour and the organisers are still seeking a definitive format for the event in 2019 it will consist of five laps of the time trial circuit, on what should be a punchy route including five climbs of the Côte d’Esquillot.For the 2018 Vuelta a España winner, Simon Yates, the shorter, steeper climbs of Spain look more suitable, along with the less controlled style of racing that is seen in the Giro d’Italia. It might well be that having looked at this route Yates will go with his “gut feeling” and look to complete this year’s unfinished business in the Italian Tour.There are three summit finishes over 2,000m, on the Col du Tourmalet in the Pyrenees and at Tignes and Val Thorens, with Tignes coming on the final Friday. The three days in the Alps look particularly brutal, with day one crossing over the Col du Galibier and finishing in Valloire, a descent so brief that this will feel akin to a summit finish.The paucity of sprint stages will make this a tough Tour to control, which is precisely what the organisers have been seeking every year since 2012.Since 2011, they have been largely unsuccessful, but 2019 could be the exception. After all, hope springs eternal in Paris in October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b56aa1cd43320d62b3d79d6db531fa175eaf14da/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0f62426d6111f9b17a2025082aa0413","title":"amazon shares record profit third quarter","story":"Company sees fourth quarter of profits greater than $1bn but revenue growth is lower than expectedAmazon has announced a record profit for the last three months of close to $3bn.

But still, two years on, when I am awake at the witching hour, two lines from Camping creep out of the rank oubliette of my memory castle and into my tender conscious mind. Once in there, they try to force me to decide which is worse: “Mummy’s stinky was bald,” or “Her urethra was very fat and raw.” Sometimes, for light relief, the haunted face of Tom (Rufus Hound) being forced to go down on Adam (“Mmpf – it’s like a hammer!”) will emerge and my laughter will chase the devils away, but otherwise it’s a long night.So it was with a strange mix of abject fear, dread, delight, anticipation and soft weeping that I greeted the news of a new series from the appalling genius that is Julia Davis. And it was with trepidation and strong drink that I sat down to watch last night’s first episode of Sally4Ever, starring Davis as the reckless, manipulative partygirl and nightclub singer Emma, who insinuates her way into the life of meek office worker Sally (Catherine Shepherd) after a torrid few nights together. Sally has recently, and reluctantly, become engaged to her long-time boyfriend David (Alex Macqueen, who played Edmund in Hunderby, and oh! for the halcyon days when “bubbly milk” was the worst thing I had ever heard), who refers to “bickies” and “intercourse”. The proposal scene (“Pleeeeease says yes, Sal, pleeeeeeease!”) is drawn out long enough to provide an enforced, full 360-degree inspection of the self-delusion, emotional agony and humiliation humans can experience and inflict on each other. It is a reminder that, when discussing Davis, new words for “black” and “comedy” need to be found. As are the foot-moisturising scene, the masturbation scene (“Could you watch?” “Do you mind if I don’t?”), the singing scenes, the egg-marketing office scenes and all points in between.Moving to Sky Atlantic from the BBC has meant that Davis has kept all her creative control and fashioned another wholly sadistic half hour that leaves the viewer skewered and writhing in exquisite agony, the actual jokes and laughter highlighting the pain at the same time as they afford you just enough relief to carry on. The zenith – or nadir – is the extended sex scene between Sally and Emma that confirms Emma’s lesbian awakening and encompasses all its creator’s greatest hits: intimacy viewed through a corrupted lens, a lingering look at bodily fluids and functions you would rather glance swiftly over, parodies of screen conventions, alongside somehow (given the unremitting physicality of the activities) a flaying of the soul.Sally breaks off her engagement to David, even though he has offered her his mother’s wedding dress to wear (stained, by “her overactive gland”). In vain does she try to explain that she still loves him but is just not attracted to him any more. “Since when?” he asks, snivel-whining in a manner that somehow still manages to wrench your heart. “I don’t know,” says Sally. “The last seven years or so?”In the final scenes after David has left the near-marital home, Emma confesses her impending homelessness to Sally, who evades the implied request but lets her in when she sees her standing outside her house later that night in the rain. If you find yourself shouting “Don’t, she’s a MONSTER!” at the screen and not knowing quite whether you are meaning Emma or Davis herself, you are not alone.Tom, Adam’s hammer – please come and chase the devils away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b91345fa4da6091edf006e543e33cd74f71224b/0_133_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47d21651cde17b700b14e1d45bdcd8dc","title":"us troops mexico border caravan","story":"Defense secretary expected to sign order as Trump seeks to make fear of immigrants a top election issueThe Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the midterms as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico.The US defense secretary, Jim Mattis, is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border, bolstering national guard forces already there, an official said Thursday.The action comes as Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from US soil.Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the 6 November midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters.The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the border patrol, said the US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced.It’s not unusual for the national guard to help with border security. Active duty troops, however, are rarely deployed within the US except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods. Fears of militarizing the border were fanned by a May 1997 incident in which a marine on a counter-narcotics mission shot to death an 18-year-old who was herding goats in Redford, Texas.Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the US is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border”, whom he has painted with a sinister brush.He has claimed, without any apparent basis in fact, that “Middle Easterners” were among the group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats organized the caravan.He tweeted Thursday: “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency”.Most of the migrants in the group are Hondurans, seeking to escape poverty and violence, and include families with children.The caravan swelled to about 7,000 people after crossing the Mexican border on 19 October, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers.Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.“To those in the Caravan, turnaround,” he wrote. “We are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!”The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them. When asked about Trump’s tweets, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep heading north.Candy Guillermo, a 37-year-old migrant in the caravan, said she and the children in group would be considered a threat. “Trump should be more humanitarian,” she said. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”Migrants who do reach the US border can claim asylum under US and international law. Those who clear an initial screening are often released until their cases are decided in immigration court, which can take several years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

It announced tie-ups with Total and the US oil services firms Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, as well as 11 other agreements with companies from Japan, China, India and the United Arab Emirates.One attendee, who asked not to be named, said he believed many more deals were signed on the sidelines of the event, which was well attended, albeit mostly by Saudis and people from the Middle East.“There were battalions of bankers, hedge funds and venture capitalists here, all wanting to find out how to tap into Saudi monies via the Public Investment Fund and also investment opportunities across the region,” the source said.Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, told the FII that Khashoggi’s killing was a “heinous crime”. He vowed to increase the standing of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf on the world stage. “The new Europe in the next 30 years will be the Middle East,” he said. Conference attendees were shown a presentation of some of Saudi Arabia’s much-vaunted “giga-projects”, including a futuristic new city called Neom, a luxury tourism project including new islands along the Red Sea coast and a gigantic amusement park called Qiddiya.The projects are part of efforts to modernise the country and ersify the economy away from oil, a strategy known as Vision 2030 and led by Bin Salman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ab8374adb8bd5c2524f88074c3d04676f08fc9d/0_0_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ee90fc10af3e511df0fda448e72be2b","title":"when do the clocks go back 2018 last time they change","story":"EU countries could ditch practice as research finds effects of changing time are worse than previously thoughtIt’s that joyous time of the year when pretty much everybody in the UK gets an extra hour in bed, as the clocks go back at 2am on Sunday 28 October with the end of British summer time. Joyous, of course, unless you are parent of small children, own pets, are working a night-shift over the weekend, or don’t like the trade of of earlier sunsets for a bit more morning light.2018 may mark one of the final times that the continent of Europe changes the clocks back in unison with the UK – or indeed at all, as moves are afoot to abolish daylight saving time in the EU.Since 2002, EU Directive 200084EC has regulated the time change between winter and summer time in the EU, stating that the last weekend in March and the last weekend in October should be the switchover dates. But a 2017 report by the European parliament into the practice has led to the European parliament voting that daylight savings time arrangement be reconsidered, allowing member states to opt out of changing their clocks. Some non-EU European countries, like Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland, have already abandoned the practice.The argument in favour of the harmonising the clock change across the EU is that it helps the single market to function, and is beneficial to the transport sector, especially cross-border, while also making some energy savings.But scientists and politicians have become increasingly worried on the impact it has on the human sleep cycle. In 2016 an investigation by the German Bundestag concluded that “the process of adaptation to the time change might be more difficult for some people than has been assumed in earlier years”.Researchers had previously thought that the clock change, particularly in spring, caused people to suffer minor jet-lag style symptoms for a couple of days after the change. They now think, according to the Bundestag report, that the effects can last up to four weeks, and that “for some people the process of adaptation itself takes place only insufficiently or not at all”.While not the highest consideration in Brexit talks over the Irish border, it raises the possibility that in the future Dublin could have to choose between abolishing daylight savings time and creating a time-zone border with Northern Ireland, or retaining it and being out of step with the time zones of some fellow EU states.Changing the clocks seems set to stay in the UK. It is just over 100 years since the concept of changing the clocks was introduced by the 1916 Summer Time Act, and there doesn’t appear to be any great groundswell of opinion among British politicians about changing domestic arrangements for British summer time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/288972e85f60d907203b236a9212edd8f011ab5c/185_378_3815_2289/master/3815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e7785df7a38a9977971217ded406066","title":"party island of boracay reopens minus drinking smoking and raw sewage","story":"Philippines tourism hotspot limits visitor numbers and clears out casinos and beach vendorsThe Philippines has reopened its famous holiday island of Boracay – spruced up and newly regulated after it was closed to mend decades of harm caused by unchecked tourism.The sandy idyll was closed to visitors in April after President Rodrigo Duterte called it a “cesspool” tainted by raw sewage flowing from hotels and restaurants straight into the sea.But the rechristened resort has a slew of new rules that restrict drinking on the beach, limit the number of tourists and hotels, all while renovations continue.Under the new regime, the beachfront has been cleared of the masseuses, vendors, bonfires and even the builders of its famous photo-op sandcastles. Buildings have been bulldozed and businesses pushed back to create a 30-metre buffer zone from the waterline.All water sports save for swimming have also been banned for the time being, while Boracay’s three casinos have been permanently closed, in line with Duterte’s wishes.Years of overdevelopment on the tiny island – which previously handled 2 million tourists a year – had left it soiled, crowded and pushed to its limits.Thirty-year-old tourist Roan Tadle from Manila said: “Even if there are many renovations and it’s not yet perfect, when you go to the beach you realise that closing it for six months was worth it.”Boracay, which major tourist magazines consistently rate as among the world’s best beaches, measures a mere 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).At peak times there would be 40,000 visitors there, spending $1bn a year but also leaving mountains of garbage and an overflowing sewer system.The new rules say 19,200 tourists will be allowed on the island at any one time, with the government aiming to enforce that by controlling the number of available hotel rooms.Nearly 400 hotels and restaurants deemed to violate local environmental laws have already been ordered closed and airlines as well as ferries have been told to restrict services.Drinking and smoking are banned on the beach and the huge multi-day beach parties dubbed “LaBoracay” that drew tens of thousands of tourists during the 1 May labour day weekend will be a thing of the past.Tourism secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat says she hopes the new Boracay will be the start of a “culture of sustainable tourism” in the Philippines, adding other tourist destinations will be next.The Boracay Foundation, the main business industry group on the island, has not commented on the restrictions but welcomed the return of tourists.Tens of thousands of workers were left unemployed when the island’s tourism machine was deprived of visitors.“Life will go back to normal. We will have money and work again,” said Jorge Flores, 45, a hotel worker. “In the past six months, hotels here were like … a ghost town.”Other places in the region strained by mass tourism have also used closures as a tactic to protect the sites from destruction.Thai authorities announced in October that the glittering bay immortalised in the movie The Beach will be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the impact of tourism."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"C\u0026ampAG notes just 246 of 547 housing bodies have signed up for regulatory systemThe newly refurbished facility will not house the 22 inmates \u0026lsquowho should not be in prison\u0026rsquoD\u0026uacuten Laoghaire-Rathdown says proposed interchanges will have negative impactTransport authority said it did not have the resources to attend local information meetings throughout the summerDermot Ahern says 2009 law was designed to make prosecutions for the act impossibleGovernment officials are working on \u0026lsquoplan B\u0026rsquo amid fears over possible collapse of processMore than 5,000 neurosurgical procedures carried out at Temple Street over past decadeHSE papers also claim senior Church figures were involved in trafficking of childrenChallenging conditions make Cape Clear the ideal location for the pilot schemeGovernment is considering the move amid surge in public order incidents on trainsInjuries are not life-threatening after gun shot to the armSustainable Energy Awards also honour Gurteen College for \u0026lsquoambitious\u0026rsquo energy planNephew of ex-taoiseach Albert Reynolds is best known for setting up Electric PicnicMinister for Communications to consult AG on Sinn F\u0026eacutein TD\u0026rsquos digital safety BillDepartment signed off on rapid build schools, says Western Building SystemsDriving with 50-80 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood will result in fine and three month road banFirst stages in planning application for ring road made to An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela"},{"url":null,"title":"irish is spoken in house of commons for first time in more than 100 years","story":"  October 24, 2018Plaid Cymru MP is one of only a few MPs to use Irish in the House of Commons   October 25, 2018, 1901: \u0026lsquoAn angry yell of indignant astonishment arose from the Irish benches\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"president higgins defends use of government jet on rt%C3%A9 debate","story":"  October 23, 2018Casey accuses incumbent of telling \u0026lsquolies\u0026rsquo as candidates trade criticisms in heated discussion   October 24, 2018Viewers of RT\u0026Eacute presidential debate got an even-handed free for all   October 24, 2018Prime Time\u0026rsquos presidential debate had no winners \u0026ndash and the big losers were its viewers   October 24, 2018RT\u0026Eacute figures show high levels of interest in final TV debate featuring all six candidates "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676056.1540493917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lack of trust between eu and britain emerging as issue in backstop talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen EU leaders discussed Britain’s departure in Brussels last week, they were happy to continue delegating the negotiations to Michel Barnier. This is partly an expression of Brexit fatigue, which may also explain why the leaders are relatively relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: APThis was supposed to be “hell week” for Theresa May after mutinous Brexiteers foretold her political assassination in grisly metaphors in last Sunday’s papers. But after surviving a Brexit statement in the House of Commons on Monday, a fiery cabinet meeting on Tuesday and an appearance before the 1922 Committee on Wednesday, the prime minister ends the week in a stronger position than she began it.But May still faces the challenge of agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU that is acceptable to her cabinet, her party and to parliament. Negotiators on both sides have had informal contacts this week but the EU will not restart formal negotiations until Britain is ready to come back with a proposal to break the deadlock.The prime minister’s statement on Monday, when she set out four tests for a deal on the Northern Ireland backstop, persuaded backbench Brexiteers that she was hardening her position in the negotiations.Downing Street sent out a similar message, signalling that May was ruling out any Northern Ireland-specific backstop appearing in any form in the withdrawal agreement.What she said was that “we must make the commitment to a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory legally binding, so the Northern Ireland-only proposal is no longer needed”. She also insisted that neither the temporary customs arrangement, an extension of the transition period nor the backstop itself could last indefinitely.The EU agrees that the temporary customs arrangement and the transition period must be time-limited, not least because the European Court of Justice is likely to rule that anything else is unlawful.The backstop, on the other hand, is an insurance policy that must, in Michel Barnier’s phrase, be “all-weather” and must remain in place “unless and until” a permanent solution is found to ensure that the Border remains open.The EU remains firm in its demand that the Northern Ireland-only backstop must remain in the withdrawal agreement and that a UK-wide customs arrangement cannot replace it but can mitigate it.When they met in Salzburg last month, EU leaders expressed concerns about a customs arrangement that would allow British goods free circulation around the EU without Britain having to comply with EU environmental and other standards.An ambitious free trade agreement could make many elements of the backstop unnecessary through measures such as a comprehensive veterinary agreement and customs facilitation. Both sides are looking at an improved version of Turkey’s customs union with the EU which would remove some of the asymmetries that disadvantage Ankara.At the heart of the dispute over the backstop is the issue of trust, with the EU asking Britain to agree to a legally binding Northern Ireland-specific backstop with the promise of a UK-wide version in the political declaration.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox, who has emerged as the cabinet’s Grand Brexit Poohbah, wants a stronger legal guarantee and the final stage of the negotiations will centre on how to reconcile the two positions in a legal text.EU negotiators are willing to come up with language that offers reassurance of their good faith and with compromises that make the backstop more acceptable to Britain. But in the political environment at Westminster, there is no guarantee that such compromises would persuade sceptical MPs to back a Brexit deal that includes the backstop.When EU leaders discussed Britain’s departure over dinner in Brussels last week, they were happy to continue delegating the negotiations to Barnier. This is partly an expression of Brexit fatigue, which may also explain why the leaders are relatively relaxed about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.European businesses are less sanguine about the economic cost of a cliff-edge Brexit next year without the buffer of a transition lasting at least 20 months. If negotiations resume after budget votes at Westminster next week, a special summit could be convened in late November to sign off on a deal.If November slides into December, pressure for a deal could raise the question of whether the backstop has to be in the withdrawal agreement. Instead of asking Britain to trust the EU, could Ireland be asked to trust both Britain and the EU to deliver a guarantee against a hard border as part of the future framework?There is no sign that other member states would agree to such a change of sequence, partly because of solidarity with Ireland but chiefly because they fear that Britain would seek to weaponise the Border in the next stage of negotiations to gain competitive advantage in a future trade deal."},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleDuke and Duchess of Sussex serenaded with anti-mosquito song in Zika-hit TongaUS tycoon Robert Durst ordered to stand trial over murder of friend 18 years agoLewis Carroll meadow under threat from £5.5 billion road and home schemeEast coast towns will be ‘given up to the sea’ How the power of Parliament came down against Sir Philip GreenWho is Lord Peter Hain?

He\u0027s always out in the garden. Hopefully he will make a full recovery.He was rescued by Devon air ambulance and the Devon and Cornwall fire brigade, and remains at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth in a stable condition.Firefighters say they were called to the incident in Bigbury-on-Sea, Devon.at 8.38am on Wednesday after the alarm was raised.Devon \u0026amp Somerset Fire Service said: He appears to have climbed on to his house extension on a ladder.We sent three appliances and an aerial ladder platform to the scene.The space to work in was far too narrow for our aerial platform, so firefighters used a stretcher from ambulance to climb up onto the roof and rescue him.It was reported to us that he had been up there for around three days.

The use of Parliament in this way is healthy and it shows democracy at work.”Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead who previously led condemnation of Sir Philip over the treatment of BHS pensioners, said: The charge sheet against the knighthood is growing. Parliament and the country have made their views clear on this matter. Ultimately it\u0027s a decision for the honours forfeiture committee.He added that he is planning to raise with ministers the need for a mechanism for abuse victims\u0027 voices to be heard in Parliament.Mr Field said: I have been talking this evening with somebody who witnessed grotesque bullying at work. They would like for what they witnessed to be shared, through the House of Commons, with the nation.I am seeking to raise urgently with the Government the importance of having a mechanism in Parliament through which the voices of victims of abuse can be heard.This would develop the role of the House of Commons in a way which stands up for people who have little money, against those who have much.Number 10 said that it could not comment on cases which were ongoing.Sir Philip Green refused to comment on “anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today” but denied any “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”.The  has spent the past eight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman, and the lengths he has gone to to cover up the claims. However, on Tuesday this newspaper was prevented from revealing details of the non-disclosure deals by Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls, the second most senior judge in England and Wales.The intervention makes it illegal, outside Parliament or in reports of Parliamentary proceedings, to reveal the businessman’s identity or to identify the companies, as well as what he is accused of doing or how much he paid his alleged victims.It was the latest twist in a legal fight which began in July, which saw the appeal court rule that the confidentiality of contracts was more important than freedom of speech.It overturned a previous High Court ruling which found that publication of the allegations would be overwhelmingly in the public interest and would significantly contribute to debate in a democratic society.As well as re-igniting the #MeToo \u2028debate, the gagging of The  has renewed controversy about the use of injunctions to limit British press freedom.Lord Hain, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, told a hushed House of Lords: “My Lords, having been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying, which is compulsively continuing, I feel it’s my duty under parliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of this story which is clearly in the public interest.”After his statement Jess Phillips, the Labour MP who sits on the Women and Equalities Committee, said: “I think that today we have proven that wealth and power and arrogance will not always provide you with cover. Whilst people can be silenced with money, as is often the case, I am pleased that actually that has its limits and that we respect the spirit of the law when people like this are revealed.”Maria Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Committee, added: “I think that given the huge influence that Philip Green has in the business world and the thousands of people that work for him it is surprising that the Court of Appeal decided that it wasn’t in the public interest to make this more public.“I think that we now have to answer another question when it comes to NDAs which is how we stop them being used to cover up serial offenders. That has to be a point that is answered by the Government proposals.”James Cleverly MP, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, said Lord Hain\u0027s action had shown people must now realise that injunctions and super-injunctions are nothing more than a good way to part with large sums of money and a bad way to keep things secret.      The business world also reacted to the claims. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, said: “Sexual harassment and racial abuse is illegal and has absolutely no place in modern Britain. Accusations this serious must be thoroughly and quickly investigated.”   There has been days of speculation about the identity of the inidual, with several prominent businessmen including Lord Sugar and Duncan Bannatyne taking to social media to state that it was not them.In light of the scandal, the Judicial Office was forced to issued a rare statement emphasising that this was a “TEMPORARY injunction preventing publication only until there can be a trial.”There has been growing condemnation over the use of NDAs in this way from both campaigners and senior legal figures, including three former Home Secretaries, a former Director of Public Prosecutions and a former solicitor general.Amber Rudd, former Home Secretary, said: “My concern is that these are being used to intimidate people who would otherwise speak up about illegal activity, by that I mean sexual harassment. We need to stop it.”Lord Falconer, former Justice Secretary, added: “Sexual harassment and bullying should not be covered by NDAs at all. It should not be possible for an employer to use an NDA to suppress any allegation which might be in the public interest. It\u0027s a terrible iniquity, it is a very, very clear abuse of power. The Prime Minister has vowed to bring forward a consultation on reform of the use of NDAs.Sir Philip bills himself as a rags-to-riches businessman and is renowned for his expletive-ridden outbursts.A guest at the now notorious President’s Club Dinner, he has previously questioned the MeToo movement, reportedly asking: “Where’s this all going to end? There’s no stag parties, no hen parties, no more girls parading in the ring at the boxing – so they’re all banned?”The Daily  front page on WednesdaySir Philip said in a statement on Thursday night: I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today.To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated.Arcadia employs more than 20,000 people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees.In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers.

Within a few years, it would be worth more than $10 billion and would eventually peak above $300 billion – surpassing the market cap of the payments giant Visa.Yet despite this success, bitcoin and the thousands of cryptocurrencies that have since appeared are still largely a fringe technology, unable to truly break into the mainstream.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearWhile bitcoin has taken off and is seen as the leader of the cryptocurrency market, it’s been adopted by the few not the many, said Chakib Bouda, chief technology officer at US-based payments firm Rambus.Confusion amongst users has played a part, but arguably the biggest failings for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past years lies with security, in the first six months of 2018 alone over $761 million bitcoin was stolen, with experts predicting that the amount stolen from exchanges will top $1.5 billion by the end of the year.The key to overcoming this issues, Bouda\u0026nbspsuggested, is keeping the private keys needed to access and use cryptocurrency funds both secure and easy-to-use.\u0026nbsp One way of doing this would be adopting technology used within the traditional financial sector to bring cryptocurrencies up to the levels of security and usability that people expect of a modern currency.Once this secure ecosystem is in place, it’s going to transform how many sceptics view bitcoin transactions, Bouda said. So whilst cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have been described as the ‘Wild West’ by the UK treasury, we expect that in 10 years’ time, bitcoin will become mainstream and have a remarkably different reputation.If bitcoin is able to transform its reputation in this way, bitcoin could find its way into everyone\u0027s pockets through mobile wallets –achieving\u0026nbspmainstream adoption\u0026nbspin time for bitcoin\u0027s next\u0026nbspbirthday.It\u0027s a view shared by Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of the online trading platform eToro. The next decade could see bitcoin being accepted as the norm when it comes to money transfer and payments, he said. As with any startup idea, early days are always risky, but I feel these are now few and far between.Alternatively, if another cryptocurrency is able to become a safe and\u0026nbspconvenient payment method\u0026nbspbefore bitcoin developers implement the necessary technology, bitcoin\u0027s place as the world\u0027s most popular cryptocurrency could be usurped.This is the view of Nigel Green, founder and CEO of the deVere\u0026nbspGroup, a financial consultancy firm based in London. Mr Green suggested that bitcoin\u0027s influence will drastically reduce in the cryptocurrency sector, however the overall crypto market will expand by at least 5,000 per cent.“Bitcoin is what kickstarted the crypto revolution and it has changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets, amongst other things, forever.\u0026nbsp It all began with bitcoin, Mr Green said.\u0026nbsp“However, whilst I don’t wish to rain on anyone’s parade, I believe that\u0026nbspbitcoin’s influence and dominance of the cryptocurrency sector will drastically reduce in its second decade.\u0026nbspThis is because as mass adoption of cryptocurrency grows, more and more digital assets will be launched – by organisations in both the private and the public sectors. This will increase competition for bitcoin and dent its market share.He continued: “In addition, it is likely that bitcoin will be hit by the superior technology, features, and problem-solutions, offered by existing and yet-to-be-released cryptocurrencies.”If the deVere\u0026nbspCEO\u0027s forecast is correct, the boost from\u0026nbspmajor institutional and retail investors will see the cryptocurrency market rocket towards\u0026nbspthe $20 trillion mark by 2028.Financial institutions and regulators, amongst others, understand that cryptocurrencies are the future of money, he concluded.\u0026nbsp“As such, the market will have grown beyond recognition when bitcoin celebrates its 20th anniversary.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And what does this turmoil mean for Saudi’s economic modernisation dreams? Ben Chu reports from the Future Investment Initiative in RiyadhClick to followThe IndependentThe Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message about the regimeIf you wanted to build a room in which to conceal an elephant it would probably have the dimensions of\u0026nbspthe opulent main hall of the King Abduaziz International conference centre in Riyadh.The neoclassical marble columns framing the rectangular space must be at least seven\u0026nbspmetres high. Crystal chandeliers hang from the stuccoed ceiling like enormous frozen explosions of bling. Everything is almost comically oversized.Everything we know about the death of Jamal KhashoggiBut even this aircraft hangar-sized Saudi Arabian ballroom could not hide one pachyderm this week: the killing of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s embassy in Istanbul earlier this month.Few spoke about it, but everyone was staring at it.The Saudi “Future Investment Initiative” – the\u0026nbsp“Davos in the desert” – was conceived as a way to suck foreign investment into the Saudi economy and to make a reality of the 33-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” economic reforms.But while “MBS”, as he is known, wants to attract foreign cash and foreign technical expertise he also wants foreign interest, foreign enthusiasm for a modernising Saudi Arabia.Before the conference began that seemed to be a dream that had been extinguished, along with the life of Khashoggi.Bosses from some of the world’s biggest corporations and financial companies – Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, Stephen\u0026nbspSchwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Masayoshi Son of Softbank to name but a few – dropped out in the wake of Khashoggi’s killing and the global wave of abhorrence about an act apparently ordered from Riyadh. Politicians did the same, from the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, to Christine Lagarde of the IMF, to our own trade secretary, Liam Fox.It was one of the most impressive no-show\u0026nbsplists in the history of parties.Yet anyone who had assumed that the conference\u0026nbspin the heart of the Saudi capital, which began on Tuesday,\u0026nbspwould have been a purely domestic, or regional, affair was mistaken. Chinese money managers and Indian business people had either not got the memo about the boycott, or did not care to join.\u0026nbspAnd there were a fair number of Western business delegates here in the sprawling Riyadh conference centre, although they tended to have less exalted titles such as “chief scientific officer” and “vice president international ision”. \u0026nbspMany were keeping a low profile and spoke about the Khashoggi case only obliquely as “the political situation”.“It’s not a good situation if the facts are as they seem,” said one Indian private equity magnate, sucking his teeth.Yet others were privately less concerned. “Look it was a mistake – but China does this kind of thing all the time and yet they get praised\u0026nbspfor being a huge infrastructure investor across the world,” complained one American. The Saudi delegates, many of them working for state companies, were on message.Most of the sessions, despite the lavish video presentations that accompanied them, were rather sparsely attended, with people preferring the mingle in small groups over Arabic tea in the\u0026nbspcorridors of the centre.But the 1,400 capacity hall was packed for the crown prince’s panel, where he would make his first public remarks since Khashoggi’s death.The stage management was not very subtle. Many of the delegates were wearing the traditional Saudi ankle-length white shirt and red-patterned headdress and a glance at their ID lanyards showed that many worked for state – or state-linked – Saudi firms. They cheered loudly\u0026nbspthe prince’s rather defiant statements and responded to his\u0026nbspjokes with ostentatious laughter.The\u0026nbspmotivation for the defiance was clear.\u0026nbspThe US and Turkey have brought extreme pressure on MBS over the killing. But there was also a clear domestic message too: “I’m not going to be toppled.”It’s not a fantastical proposition. The crown prince has alienated a lot of powerful Saudis – a year ago he locked dozens of them, including princes, in the Ritz-Carlton hotel, right next door to the very conference centre in which he was speaking, until they agreed to hand back assets to the state which they were accused of corruptly appropriating. Whatever the truth about the legitimacy of their claims to those assets, this was hardly a model of open justice and transparent government.Will it work? Did bin Salman shore up his position with his words?But, despite reports from Turkey this week that President Recep\u0026nbspTayyip\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspis not set on regime change in Riyadh, Ankara seems determined to turn up the pressure on MBS\u0026nbspfurther over the killing. And, of course, nothing said before a friendly audience in Riyadh is likely to sway the White House and its erratic occupant.It seems fair to say that the fate of the crown prince remains in the balance.And so, inevitably, does that of his ambitious economic reforms, which include building a $500bn high-tech city in the desert and turning the kingdom into a tourist hub to rival Dubai.The crown prince boasted of $50bn of inward investment deals signed with Western energy and infrastructure firms at the conference. But there was little detail and some analysts said some were likely to have been projects that had already been announced.We will likely not know for many months how much damage has been done by the Khashoggi affair to the appetite of Western firms to invest in the kingdom. The irony is that few would deny that bin Salman has identified the right economic strategy – ersification away from the liquefied dinosaur export business known as oil. Around 40 per cent of the kingdom’s GDP and 90 per cent of Riyadh’s\u0026nbsptax revenues come\u0026nbspfrom fossil fuels at present. That is a precarious position in a world in which there is now a broadening (if not total) consensus that decarbonisation is environmentally and economically necessary. Jamal Khashoggi death ‘the worst cover up ever’Another rather bitter irony is that MBS’s\u0026nbspsocial reforms seem genuinely popular, especially among younger people.One single female Saudi economic consultant stressed to me over lunch in the heaving dining room of the Ritz-Carlton how important the granting of the freedom for women to drive cars was.“Before I had to have a driver. Now I can travel to meetings on my own. And it’s changing attitudes too. Men must now look at us as human beings not objects,” she said.“It’s a sexual revolution – I’m not joking,” said one European-based energy executive who comes to Saudi around 100 days every year. “You should tell your readers about that!”Yet MBS has not been a political reformer. Most non-partisan observers agree that the political realm is now\u0026nbspslammed shut. And the Khashoggi killing has sent a terrifying message to those who might have been minded to criticise the\u0026nbspregime.Another irony is that amid the uproar over the killing of Khashoggi another story has gone ignored. The United Nations warned this week that Yemen, where Saudi forces are attempting to suppresses a Houthi insurgency through a blockade, is on the brink of a “massive loss of life” due to famine.That, alas, was an elephant in the room that everyone at this week’s tense conference in the Arabian desert seemed to manage to ignore without any difficulty at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The CPS has issued European Arrest Warrants for the extradition in connection with the Novichok poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal The store closures will bring the Debenhams estate down to about 100 locations and come on top of 10 earmarked earlier this year.As part of the shake-up, Mr Bucher will attempt to take £130m\u0026nbspof costs out of the business, including suspending the idend.Sales for the year also slipped 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspto £2.9bn, while like-for-like revenue fell 2.3 per cent.Despite the dire\u0026nbspresults, some analysts point\u0026nbspto positives for the department store chain.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Debenhams\u0026nbspis capitalising on a growing consumer preference for experiences over material goods.The chain has installed gyms and food outlets in a bid to make the most out of the large amount of floorspace it has.\u0026nbsp“The retailer is also investing in improved customer service, which is vitally important, as this is something digital-only players can’t replicate,” Mr Khalaf said.“Debenhams is also focused on its online offering, which is bearing fruit and growing strongly, albeit not enough to outweigh declines on the high street.”Debenhams’ problems come as a raft of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare also embark on store closure programmes.Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026nbsphas a chance to reduce the pain for retailers with tax changes in his Budget announcement next week.He is rumoured to be considering giving retailers a £300m\u0026nbspbusiness rates cut for town centres that have been particularly badly hit by the shift to online sales.But leading retail figures want the chancellor to do more. Last month, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis urged ministers to implement a £1.25bn “Amazon tax” for online sales.Mr Bucher told the BBC on Thursday: “I promise my 26,000 staff that we will try to protect as many jobs as we can.\u0026nbspAs our numbers show, we are a publicly solvent business.“I think it’s no surprise that customers have shifted online, they buy less in store, they buy more online.“That is the issue we are addressing with our announcement today. We want to have fewer but better stores.”Mr Bucher\u0026nbspdeclined to say which stores he planned to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The companies said the pair-up is expected to be a success because Sainsbury’s and Oasis cater to very similar demographics. Two Oasis concessions will open at Sainsbury’s supermarkets before Christmas at Sydenham in south London and at Selly Oak, near Birmingham. Sainsbury\u0027s sales growth slows as it slashes pricesSainsbury’s launches new vegan range due to increasing demandMPs accuse Sainsbury’s of giving staff ultimatum over new pay dealsSainsbury’s said these two locations had been “carefully selected” because they are stores where the Tu clothing range performs “particularly strongly”. Sainsbury’s director of commercial, James Brown, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Oasis to Sainsbury’s stores. Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base. The retailer has previously agreed partnerships with Clarks and Specsavers. Meanwhile, the group is in the process of buying Asda, which will make it the UK’s biggest retailer, ahead of Tesco, if the deal completes. The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The suspects Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, are Russian nationals, and approximately 40 years old. They travelled on a Russian passport and it is likely that they were travelling under aliases and that these are not their real names. The CPS has issued European Arrest Warrants for the extradition in connection with the Novichok poisoning attack on Sergei Skripal The store closures will bring the Debenhams estate down to about 100 locations and come on top of 10 earmarked earlier this year.As part of the shake-up, Mr Bucher will attempt to take £130m\u0026nbspof costs out of the business, including suspending the idend.Sales for the year also slipped 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspto £2.9bn, while like-for-like revenue fell 2.3 per cent.Despite the dire\u0026nbspresults, some analysts point\u0026nbspto positives for the department store chain.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Debenhams\u0026nbspis capitalising on a growing consumer preference for experiences over material goods.The chain has installed gyms and food outlets in a bid to make the most out of the large amount of floorspace it has.\u0026nbsp“The retailer is also investing in improved customer service, which is vitally important, as this is something digital-only players can’t replicate,” Mr Khalaf said.“Debenhams is also focused on its online offering, which is bearing fruit and growing strongly, albeit not enough to outweigh declines on the high street.”Debenhams’ problems come as a raft of retailers including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare also embark on store closure programmes.Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026nbsphas a chance to reduce the pain for retailers with tax changes in his Budget announcement next week.He is rumoured to be considering giving retailers a £300m\u0026nbspbusiness rates cut for town centres that have been particularly badly hit by the shift to online sales.But leading retail figures want the chancellor to do more. Last month, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis urged ministers to implement a £1.25bn “Amazon tax” for online sales.Mr Bucher told the BBC on Thursday: “I promise my 26,000 staff that we will try to protect as many jobs as we can.\u0026nbspAs our numbers show, we are a publicly solvent business.“I think it’s no surprise that customers have shifted online, they buy less in store, they buy more online.“That is the issue we are addressing with our announcement today. We want to have fewer but better stores.”Mr Bucher\u0026nbspdeclined to say which stores he planned to close.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And for medicine, the number of EU applicants fell from 1,800 to 1,660.The fall comes despite the government’s confirmation in July that EU students enrolling in English universities in the first academic year after Brexit will pay the same tuition fees as British students.Jo Burton, a policy analyst at the Russell Group -\u0026nbspa self-selected association of twenty-four public research universities -\u0026nbspsaid: “It’s too early to say precisely what’s driving down the numbers.She added: However, given ongoing Brexit uncertainty, factors could include the lack of clarity over EU student fees, the longer duration of medicine courses and concerns over how UK qualifications will be recognised abroad once we leave the EU. The fees for EU students starting at English universities next year were only confirmed by the Government in July – just three months before the application deadline.This simply\u0026nbspisn’t enough time for many people considering international study and we urge ministers to provide clarity asap on EU fee levels for 202021 and beyond.”Professor Jenny Higham, chair of the Medical Schools Council, said: “The continued lack of clarity around leaving the EU has caused uncertainty in the higher education and healthcare sectors, both of which impact medical education and the supply of doctors.But she added: “Despite this, the new figures reveal the highest number of overall applications to medicine for many years, showing that it remains a highly attractive course and profession.\u0026nbspIn part this may be connected to the funding by government of a 25 per cent increase in places in England.\u0026nbspIt will also relate to the ongoing work medical schools do to promote the importance of the profession and its accessibility to anyone with the right attributes to become a doctor.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Daily  today reports that they were subject to a gagging order to prohibit them publishing the details of a leading businessman who is facing allegations of sexual assault and racial abuseThousands of female workers have today taken to the streets of Glasgow over an equal pay dispute with the City CouncilFormer politan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who has called for an urgent review of the evidence around legislation of cannabis.

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count. Hong Kong felt very far away from it all, and to be honest Brexit gave us an excuse for a boozy lunch in some drab Belgian-themed pub and the opportunity to use the suffix “exit”\u0026nbspto describe the leaving do of a friend moving away from\u0026nbspthe city.Created with Sketch.In pictures: The coffin homes of Hong Kong Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A general view of residential and commercial buildings in Yau Tsim Mong District which is a popular location for the \u0027subided units\u0027 in Hong KongA five year-old boy plays outside his tiny home, which is made of concrete and corrugated metal on the rooftop of an apartment block as he lives with his parents in an illegal rooftop dwellingA resident walks outside his illegal rooftop dwelling, which is located next to a public housing estate, in the backgroundLi Suet-wen and her son, 6, and daughter, 8, live in a 120-square foot room crammed with a bunk bed, small couch, fridge, washing machine and small table in Hong Kong.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The companies said the pair-up is expected to be a success because Sainsbury’s and Oasis cater to very similar demographics. Two Oasis concessions will open at Sainsbury’s supermarkets before Christmas at Sydenham in south London and at Selly Oak, near Birmingham. Sainsbury\u0027s sales growth slows as it slashes pricesSainsbury’s launches new vegan range due to increasing demandMPs accuse Sainsbury’s of giving staff ultimatum over new pay dealsSainsbury’s said these two locations had been “carefully selected” because they are stores where the Tu clothing range performs “particularly strongly”. Sainsbury’s director of commercial, James Brown, said: “We are delighted to be welcoming Oasis to Sainsbury’s stores. Its on-trend fashion ranges will complement our high quality Tu clothing offer and support our strategy to make our stores leading fashion destinations.”Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said: “Trialling Oasis in Sainsbury’s is an exciting development for us. This is about presenting the Oasis product proposition and brand experience to Sainsbury’s customers. The customer demographic of both brands is very similar and therefore it is a natural strategic partnership.”This is the latest in a string of deals Sainsbury’s has executed in a bid to ersify its offering and grow its customer base. The retailer has previously agreed partnerships with Clarks and Specsavers. Meanwhile, the group is in the process of buying Asda, which will make it the UK’s biggest retailer, ahead of Tesco, if the deal completes. The companies are waiting for regulatory approval from the competition watchdog, which may require the closure of hundreds of stores before the takeover can go ahead. The CMA has said it will assess whether the merger “could lead to a worse outcome for shoppers through higher prices, a poorer shopping experience, or reductions in the range or quality of products offered”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Lady Green owns all of the shares in their company, Taveta, which is registered in Jersey and controls Arcadia.\u0026nbspSir Philip has claimed he chose to live in the principality\u0026nbspbecause of a “heart scare” he had twenty years ago.Lady Green has pointed out other benefits to tax havens: “My understanding is that jurisdictions such as Jersey and the British Virgin Islands are commonly preferred for their strong regulatory regimes,” she wrote to MPs\u0026nbspin 2016.The Arcadia Group is the clothing empire that made Sir Philip’s reputation as a retail king and remains the source of much of his wealth. It boasts some of the biggest names on the high street: Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, Wallis, Evans, Burton and - the jewel in the crown - Topshop, which has successfully expanded into the US in recent years.But the rapid upward trajectory has recently reversed with the Arcadia’s value being slashed by half in just a year. Topshop’s revenues dropped 5.6 per cent last year, in spite of a jump in online sales.Topshop lost £10.9m in the year to August 2017, compared with a £59.4m profit in the previous 12 months. It also has a worrying pension deficit of up to £1bn - not the first time one of Sir Philip’s companies have experienced problems in that regard.The tycoon bought BHS for £200m in 2000 and took it back into private ownership. He rebranded it as British Home Stores and brought it under his Arcadia umbrella before ridding himself of it in 2015, by which time it had racked up £1.3bn in debt including a large pension deficit.\u0026nbspUntil the recent sexual harassment allegations it was Sir Philip’s conduct during and after the disposal of BHS that had most tarnished reputation.Pensions committee chair Sir Frank Field summed it up succinctly earlier this year: “Sir Philip Green stripped BHS bare and then left it for dead, with contemptuous disregard for the pensioners.”\u0026nbspPhilip Green\u0027s case is proof that we need to get rid of NDAs for good£500,000 in 28 seconds is the fastest money Philip Green has ever lostPhilip Green named in parliament as businessman who gagged mediaSurrounding himself with \u0027yes\u0027 men was Philip Green’s undoingAre Sir Philip Green and Frank Field up for a rematch? Let\u0027s just seeThe businessman sold BHS for £1 to a company controlled by a Dominic Chappell, a man who had been declared bankrupt three times and had no retail experience.\u0026nbspThe chain collapsed into administration a year later, with 11,000 jobs lost and a £571m deficit in the pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe Pensions Regulator found that the “main purpose” of the transaction was so that Sir Philip could avoid liability for the fund which contained 22,000 people’s retirement savings.Sir Philip came under heavy and sustained fire from the regulator and MPs, before eventually making a voluntary payment of £363m to help make up the deficit.\u0026nbspMPs recommend former BHS owner Sir Philip Green is stripped of knighthoodSir Philip owns three luxurious yachts including the 295ft Lionheart which he bought for £100m at about the same time as he took collection of a £46m Gulfstream private jet and offloaded BHS.He was believed to be holidaying on the Lionheart in the Mediterranean when he stated in September 2016 that he was “working every day” to save the stricken retailer’s pension scheme.\u0026nbspThe previous month he was filmed\u0026nbspon the Greek Island of Ithaca attacking a reporter who tried to question him about BHS’ demise. “That’s going in the f***** sea,” Sir Philip shouted while pointing towards the reporter’s camera equipment.The Pensions Regulator said at the time that the vessel could be seized in order to generate cash to pay into the BHS fund. In the end he kept both the yacht and his knighthood, though there will now be renewed calls for him to be stripped of the latter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Today, I want to take the opportunity to apologise to those affected by this practice.”The home secretary said the majority of cases identified had been part of a 2016 operation aimed at addressing fraud.He said\u0026nbspseven cases in this operation were refused on suitability grounds solely for the failure to provide DNA evidence, and a further six were refused partly for that reason.Fifty-one further cases have\u0026nbspbeen identified as part of a 2013 scheme\u0026nbspto allow relatives of Gurkha soldiers to settle in the UK, which wrongly stated that DNA evidence was required, Mr Javid said.A third scheme assessed immigration applications from Afghan nationals working for the UK\u0026nbspgovernment on the basis of mandatory DNA testing. Mr Javid\u0026nbspsaid no one from\u0026nbspthis cohort\u0026nbsphad been refused on these grounds.He said his\u0026nbspdepartment would seek to reimburse any inidual who has suffered financial loss as a result of the errors and was continuing\u0026nbspto closely examine whether any other groups had been affected.Home Office forcing immigrants to take DNA tests against own policyHe also said he was taking action to correct the situation\u0026nbspand had given “clear instructions” that officials should not seek DNA samples. The provision of DNA evidence must be entirely voluntary, he added.Expanding on his apology, Mr Javid\u0026nbspsaid: “It is not fair, and this should not have happened. No one should have faced a demand to provide DNA evidence and no one should have been penalised for not providing it.”It comes after it emerged in July that a\u0026nbspletter had been sent by the Home Office to an applicant’s solicitor stating that it was “imperative” they submit DNA evidence to confirm the paternity of their client’s child, despite the fact that the child already had a British passport.The applicant\u0027s solicitor, Enny Choudhury, of\u0026nbspthe Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said:\u0026nbsp“My client and her child were rendered destitute for 2.5 years as a direct result of the Home Office’s illegal practices.It is clear that countless others will have been subject to the same treatment and it is astonishing that ministers still do not have a grasp on the failings of the Home Office.We agree with the home secretary that there must be a review, but it must be fully independent of him and his Home Office. No one could have faith in its competence to properly investigate its own failings.” \u0026nbspYvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: “Coming after\u0026nbspWindrush, this shows something is going very wrong in the Home Office again.\u0026nbsp“A new wider review must be independent and should examine oversight failure and impact of policies on culture of Home Office operations.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, of Amnesty UK, said the\u0026nbspHome Office had “once again been exposed as being a law unto itself”.He added: “The home secretary needs to face up to the fact that problems in his department are systemic, chronic and deep-rooted.\u0026nbsp“Over several decades, successive governments have consistently encouraged policies and practice which disrespect the law and harm the people directly affected.“This dysfunctional department cannot continue to be rewarded by being given more powers while vital safeguards, such as appeal rights and legal aid, are stripped away.\u0026nbsp“Root and branch reform is urgently needed and protections restored to keep the Home Office in check.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The lack of debate equates to a major, and troubling, democratic deficit at the heart of the proposals.”Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingGreen MEP for the South East Keith Taylor said the study revealed “the terrifying extent of the impact of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc”, and questioned the legality of pushing ahead without consulting with local communities.“It clearer than ever that the project a monumental disaster and act of environmental sabotage,” he said.Responding to the claims,\u0026nbspan NIC spokesman\u0026nbspsaid: “Our recommendations come with the clear condition that new schemes should not compromise the high quality natural environment for existing and future residents, and do not need to involve any changes to existing Green Belt protections.“In fact, our report made clear the need for significant investment in landscape improvements, affordable housing and sustainable transport. These changes are vital to make the most of the area’s economic potential and the contribution it makes to the wider UK economy.”CPRE\u0026nbsphas called for a full assessment to be conducted that looks at the impact on people’s health and wellbeing as well as environmental impacts including climate change.Instead of investing in the new expressway, the group called for investment in improved public transport in the region alongside a commitment to building “genuinely affordable homes”.The government is aiming to build 300,000 new homes need to be built each year in England to meet demand, and experts have warned of significant backlogs.Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Understanding the ‘clans’ offers valuable insights into who might want what from Brexit and how this might affect future elections, or indeed referendum outcomes.”Between the 2015 and 2017 election both Labour and the Tories increased their share in many of the groups, squeezing out smaller parties.Created with Sketch.How big are the UK\u0027s voter clans and how do they vote?

Instead, he said, he had argued that claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspthe party\u0027s costings contained factual mistakes were irrelevant.He wrote on Twitter: Apparently the prime minister quoted me saying about Labour\u0027s 2017 manifesto \u0027the numbers did not add up\u0027. In fact I said \u0027let us suppose the IFS was correct\u0027 and examined consequences. I have never taken a view on whether they diddidn\u0027t add up. If that is what she said, she lied.In a blog post titled The day Theresa May lied in parliament about something I wrote, he continued: The point I wanted to stress was that it didn’t matter if the IFS were right that the numbers didn’t add up, because the fiscal stance was good for the economy, and could well satisfy Labour\u0027s very good Fiscal Credibility Rule.Of the prime minister\u0027s comments, he said: Was this an unfortunate case of misreading? It seems extremely implausible. I’m certain that when the PM or more probably some adviser misquotes someone in a draft PMQ response, someone - possibly even the person themselves - checks that the quote is correct. You have to have serious comprehension difficulties to misunderstand the meaning of \u0027let us suppose\u0027.He suggested Ms May\u0027s claim was a deliberate\u0026nbsplie told to gain political effect but said he would be\u0026nbspwilling to accept it was an honest mistake if the prime minister\u0026nbspor someone from her team could explain how it happened.\u0026nbspHe said: In the scheme of things the issue is very minor, but the prime minister\u0026nbsplying whatever the context should be important. But the sad thing is that no one is surprised by this kind of thing any more.We in the UK look at Trump’s lying with horror and think this is something uniquely American. But this government has been pulled up countless time\u0026nbspfor misleading the public by misusing statistics and of course the lies of the Brexiters are shameless.Mr Wren-Lewis said he had\u0026nbspasked the Conservative Party for an apology but was not holding my breath.The matter was raised in the Commons by Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, who suggested Ms May should apologise.Khan warns Labour MPs not to \u0027blackmailed\u0027 over PM\u0027s Brexit dealUK to \u0027revoke Saudi suspects\u0027 visas today\u0027 over Khashoggi\u0027s murderMay confirms she will attend showdown meeting with Tory rebelsMay sidesteps rebels with plans to enshrine Brexit proposal in lawMaking a point of order, he said: During Prime Minister’s Questions, the prime minister asserted that the respected Oxford economist and professor, Simon Wren-Lewis, said, in reference to Labour’s manifesto, \u0027the numbers did not add up\u0027.However, Professor Wren-Lewis disputes the accuracy of those remarks.Quoting\u0026nbspthe academic\u0027s tweet, he added: Would it be appropriate for the prime minister to come back to this House to correct the record and apologise to the renowned professor in question?The deputy speaker, Eleanor Laing,\u0026nbspsaid she was sure Ms May\u0027s comments were made in good faith and that\u0026nbspit was not her job to assess the accuracy of claims made in the Commons.No 10 has been contacted for comment.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He thought he could get the documents he needed showing he was orced, a legal requirement, from the people in Washington. I think they told him it was a simple matter. But then they said he needed to go to Turkey to get the papers. I am not sure whether he was told about going to Turkey by people in DC or Riyadh.”Created with Sketch.

But now, after what has happened, there is obviously cause for suspicion.\u0026nbsp“Let’s face it, they would not have dared to do what they did in Istanbul in America. They must have thought it would be much easier in Turkey to do what they planned. This has backfired, but we still don’t know if those really responsible will\u0026nbspface justice.”One of those most insistent in trying to persuade the journalist to return to Saudi Arabia was Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant of the crown prince, who made Mr Khashoggi a number of lucrative offers in an attempt to get him back to the Kingdom, including a senior government position and a senior post in the administration.\u0026nbspHe repeatedly reassured Khashoggi, say multiple sources, he had nothing to fear by going back home.It subsequently been\u0026nbspclaimed that Mr al-Qahtani directed the journalist’s seizure, torture and killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul via Skype, allegedly telling the team dispatched for Mr Khashoggi to kill him and “bring me the head of the dog”.Mr al-Qahtani had launched vitriolic and sustained attacks through\u0026nbspsocial media on the Kingdom’s supposed enemies, and declared they would “pay the price” for treachery. The Saudi government claimed that Mr al-Qahtani was fired after Khashoggi’s killing, along with another senior official. Eighteen others have been arrested.Mr al-Qahtani, it has been reported, led the interrogation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri when he was detained in Saudi Arabia last year after being enticed to the country to meet the crown prince.\u0026nbspThe questioning, it has been claimed, was accompanied by verbal and physical abuse. Mr Hariri was freed and returned to Beirut only after intervention by French President Emmanuel Macron.Everything we know about the death of Jamal Khashoggi‘If anyone was aware of Khashoggi plot, crown prince was,’ says TrumpRussia refuses to criticise Saudi Arabia after journalist’s murderTurkey’s Erdogan says ‘savage’ murder of Khashoggi was premeditated Mr al-Qahtani claimed he had the support and approval of the Saudi royal family in all he did. “Do you think I make decisions without guidance? I am an employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the King and my lord the faithful Crown Prince” he tweeted last summer.Mr Khashoggi had met the Saudi ambassador to the US, Prince Khaled bin Salman, a brother of Prince Mohammed, on one of his visits to the embassy a few weeks before his death. He had told friends that the ambassador had been amiable and pleasant.Prince Khaled, known as KBS, flew to Saudi Arabia after Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance in Istanbul and has not returned to the US. \u0026nbspIn a text message sent to a number of people in Washington, and disseminated later to the media, the ambassador said that Khashoggi “has many friends in the Kingdom, including myself” and had “maintained regular contact when he was in Washington ... Jamal is a Saudi citizen whose safety and security is a top priority for the Kingdom, just as is the case with any other citizen. We will not spare any efforts to locate him.”There is no suggestion that Prince Khaled had played any part in Khashoggi travelling to Istanbul from Washington for his papers.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has charged that Mr Khashoggi had been targeted in a Saudi plot which had been in place for a long time. On Thursday authorities in Riyadh stated that Khashoggi’s murder was premeditated.\u0026nbspThis was yet another change of stance from the Kingdom’s government, which had firstly claimed that the journalist had left the consulate by a back door (a Saudi official was later found to have been impersonating him doing this) and then that he was killed during a “fist fight”. The murder, they say now, is due to a “rogue operation”.Jamal Khashoggi death ‘the worst cover up ever’“There were offers made to Jamal to return from people close to the royal family, there were quite a few from Qahtani. I don’t think Jamal trusted him, he had a reputation. \u0026nbsp“It is also the case that his orce took place partly because his wife could not cope with the propaganda being aimed at him by the government, and Qahtani, of course, was running the propaganda against all who were considered enemies.” \u0026nbspThe investigation into Khashoggi’s mutilation and murder continues. Gina Haspel, the CIA director who has flown to Turkey, is reported to have now\u0026nbspheard audio tapes provided by authorities in Ankara.\u0026nbspPrince Mohammed\u0026nbsphas stressed that Saudi and Turkish investigators are working together. “We will prove to the world that the two governments are cooperating to punish any criminal, any culprit and at the end justice will prevail,”\u0026nbsphe said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He laughed at me, Daud tells Sun Online.He later took McGowan to court and won damages, but his local council didn’t prosecute.“I will never forget that night as long as I live,” Daud says.“I went home at pm in a neck brace to find all my worldly possessions, including a ripped photo of my mum on her wedding day in Somalia, thrown into the street.“I had nowhere to go, and that night I felt suicidal. I saw no point in living.A friend offered him a temporary place to stay.Three years on, Daud, now , is proudly running his own community centre in Brent - All Nations - helping people from all ethnic backgrounds with problems such as the one he experienced. He also has a council property to call home.“That night changed my le and made me realise that I was going to have to start my le all over again. I love helping people and I am proud of the work I do.”Property owner Bernard McGowan boasts of having a £m portfolio but has been convicted six times since , and was fined more than £, for property offences last year.His tenants have complained of intimidation, electricity being disconnected, locks being changed and deposits never being ed - and of forced evictions from homes riddled with cold, damp and vermin, sometimes with beds and personal possessions strewn outside the front doors.Many of McGowan’s tenants are vulnerable. Erskine Clarke was sleeping rough before the council housed him in a West London property costing almost £ a week for a ft x ft room in a shared house with mould, a faulty boiler and a leaking toilet.Erskine says requests for repairs to McGowan were ignored, and the boiler problem went on for two years, resulting in no heating or hot water.He still lives at the property but now has a new landlord who is renovating it.The scarred tenant adds: “Nobody should be living in the state it was in. It made me depressed. I lost a lot of weight and got very sick. Why does the government let people do this But sadly, Doud and Erskine arent the only tenants suffering.Between  and , landlord Gary Fixter, , failed to act on repeated warnings to improve the standard of his properties, despite collecting £, a year in rent and earning a salary of £, a year as an IT consultant.He pleaded guilty to  offences between  and , with eight convictions for renting out substandard shared houses, often without heating, water supplies or fire alarms.He rented out a shed for £ a month, a property with live wires spilling out from the mains electrical unit, and another infested with rats.One of those hoping for justice for private rental tenants is -year-old Askel Douglas, who last year was spending every penny of his £ a week universal credit on a Neasden flat above a supermarket in London which flooded three times.“I was totally ripped off by my private landlord, Askel, who has now moved, told The Sun Online.There was water coming out of the walls and ceilings so it was knee-deep and a total mess, and stinking, dirty water was coming up through the plug so I couldn’t even have a bath.Jacky Peacock OBE, is director of London charity AdviceRenters, which is campaigning for reform of the private renting sector.She and her colleagues regularly witness the appalling standards in domestic renting which can be so bad they make tenants ill.“The things I see are atrocious. Filthy flats in a state of complete disrepair, but also we see many problems with overcrowding,” Jacky told The Sun Online.“People are exploited by employers as well as landlords, often migrant workers who are hardly paid anything, and they end up in these dreadful places, trying to raise their children.“We recently saw a Hungarian couple who lived with their six-year-old child in one small room. The husband was a mini cab driver who worked all hours to earn money for them, and he came back to the property one day to find the landlord had let himself into the room and was molesting his we.“The landlord brandished a kitchen kne and tried to stab the tenant – this is the kind of atrocious thing we’re seeing day after day. It makes me so angry that vulnerable people are exploited like this.”Access to a ing, clean kitchen can be dficult when people are crowded into one property.“We were in a flat last week where the sink leaked, so every time the tap went on, the downstairs flat was flooded. The landlord had been to fix it but basically he’d just propped it up,” says Jacky.She believes a flood of amateur landlords – buy-to-let owners investing in property with no knowledge of their legal responsibilities – are making the problem worse.AdviceRenters is urging the government to introduce and enforce a national regulatory scheme for the private rental sector.The charity shared a series of recent photographs with The Sun Online, all of them taken in London properties in shocking states of disrepair.They show damp, rotten fire escapes, leaking toilets, sinks and showers and boarded-up windows.Tenants suffering at the hands of unscrupulous landlords are often on low incomes or benefits - people with no bargaining power and little choice as to where they live. They’re crammed into houses in large and dangerous numbers andthey complain, they’re evicted.A grim roster of greedy iniduals taking cruel advantage of society’s most vulnerable has been revealed in an investigation by ITV News.Rogue landlords are collecting rents – often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit – despite being convicted of housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales.Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal.The government’s efforts to police rogue landlords have been branded “weak” and “pathetic” after the investigation found convicted landlords continuing to operate through loopholes in the law.In response, Heather Wheeler MP, the minister for housing and homelessness, has said: “Everyone deserves a decent and safe place to live, and we are reforming the private rented sector to make it fairer for all.”Angry tenant Askel blasts: “I can’t understand why the government lets people like me get ripped off for every penny we have.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ending austerity will have to wait. ECONOMYEd Conway, economics editorI am looking out for...the chancellor manages to break out of the restraints imposed on him.Ever since the era of Gordon Brown, the chancellor has had two big annual opportunities to deliver major changes to the UK economy.When he came into office, Philip Hammond changed that: as well as shting the budget from the spring into the autumn, he proclaimed that from now on there would only be a single major fiscal event every year. One change to sht the needle every  months.The great irony is that now Mr Hammonds single shot has come around, he is so penned in that there is not all that much he can do.The biggest elephant in the room is Brexit. We are still days, week, possibly months away from having a deal on Brexit - and until that is determined, there is little point in the chancellor making major fiscal plans.The second issue is that without a majority, the government has little scope to introduce radical policies. The final constraint is that the prime minister has also laid down some crucial red lines.In her party conference speech earlier this month, Mrs May promised to end austerity. She has also committed to considerable extra spending on the NHS.Those two commitments mean Mr Hammond has little leeway. Happily, tax receipts have come in much stronger than expected in recent months, so he no longer needs to raise taxes considerably to fulfil those aims.The budget will be a steady-as-she-goes affair. A survival budget.Whether it is enough to keep Mr Hammond - or for that matter Mrs May - in office for the next  months is another question.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey\"\" data-targeting-\"\" data-tag\"\" data-component-name\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label\"Advertisement\" id\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance\"\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/10/2048x1152/skynews-robert-de-niro-joe-biden_4464381.jpg?20181025141133 ","title":"us mail bombs fbi focus on florida in suspicious packages investigation","story":"The packages were intercepted two weeks before the US mid-term elections and has brought Mr Trumps harsh rhetoric towards his adversaries to light.He condemned the attempted attacks but hit out at the mainstream media on Twitter.\"A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely  and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,\" he wrote.\"It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description.

The former cabinet minister used parliamentary privilege to name the Topshop tycoon after the Dailywas barred from publishing allegations of sexual harassment and racial abuse against him. The paper wants to reveal confidential information from five employees, who have been prevented from discussing their claims by non-disclosure agreements .But Sir Philip categorically and wholly denied being guilty of any unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, in a statement issued hours after the Labour peers dramatic intervention in the House of Lords. Lord Hain told BBC Twos Newsnight he had received overwhelming support - particularly from women. Lord Hain told peers he had been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case and felt it was his duty to use parliamentary privilege to name Sir Philip. Having been contacted by somebody intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying, which is compulsively continuing, I feel its my duty under parliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of a story which is clearly in the public interest, he said.  Lord Hain later confirmed his statement referred to the chairman of Arcadia Group, whose brands include Topshop, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit. Sir Philip responded in a statement, saying: I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today. To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. Arcadia and I take accusations and grievances from employees very seriously and in the event that one is raised, it is thoroughly investigated. Arcadia employs more than , people and in common with many large businesses sometimes receives formal complaints from employees. In some cases these are settled with the agreement of all parties and their legal advisers. These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.  The principle of parliamentary privilege means that MPs and peers cannot be sued for libel for comments made in the Houses of Parliament, and offers protection to media outlets reporting those comments. Speaking to Newsnight, Lord Hain explained his decision to speak out, saying: What concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse. And that was what led me to act in the way that I did. Its for others to judge whether Ive been right or wrong. But theres no point in being in Westminster - which is the sovereign centre of the British constitution, has sovereignty and with it the parliamentary privilege that is a privilege ...you never discharge thatyou never deploy the precious rights of parliamentary privilege.  He stressed that the cloak of privilege should be used extremely carefully with integrity and very responsibly - never just loosely.On Wednesday, Theresa May pledged to hasten measures to improve regulation around so-called gagging clauses in response to questions about the case.The Prime Minister said some employers are using NDAs unethically as she criticised abhorrent sexual harassment in the workplace. Mrs Mays spokesman declined to comment on Lord Hains statement. Askedthe PM feels it is acceptable for parliamentarians to use the protection of privilege to put information into the public domain in this way, the spokesman said: The rules of parliamentary privilege are a matter for Parliament and how they exercise these rules is obviously a matter for inidual members.

The tycoon was today unmasked in Parliament by Lord Hain as the figure accused of trying to gag the allegations. Greens expensive efforts to remain anonymous over sexual harassment claims were ended in Parliament today. Veteran politician Peter Hain used parliamentary privilege to name Green in the Lords – something he would not be able to do outside the House. And the move sparked further demands for businessman Green to be stripped of his shyknighthood after he managed to cling on to it despite the collapse of the BHS chain with the loss of , jobs and a poundmillion pension black hole.  The -year-old had used a court injunction to stop the Dailyfrom revealing he was the figure who agreed financial settlements and non-disclosure agreements with alleged victims of sexual shyharassment, racist abuse and bullying. Green denies all the allegations. Sir Vince Cable said: “I find it dficult to see how he could credibly hold on to an honour in these circumstances. “He narrowly and luckily escaped losing his knighthood over the pensions scandal. If these allegations are correct, he should certainly be stripped of his knighthood.” Labour MP Clive Lewis added: “If he has used his wealth to gag people and given the disgrace of what happened on the BHS pensions, how that was basically asset-stripped and the lives of thousands potentially ruined, I think it says a lot about this countrysomeone like that can be given a shyknighthood and keep their knighthood having the reputation they do.” Neil Saunders, managing director of industry experts Global Data Retail, warned the claims against Topshop boss Green could be potentially damaging to his business.  He said: “While the allegations are only claims and have not yet been legally proven, Philip Green’s association with them is highly damaging for both him and the retail businesses he owns. “Unless the claims are proven to be  then there is no coming back. The stench of sexual misconduct lingers for le.” Women and Equalities Select Committee chair Maria Miller blasted judges for granting the gagging order. She said: “Given the huge influence Philip Green wields in the world of business it is surprising the Court of Appeal decided it wasn’t in the public interest to make public the string of payments that have been made.” Thespent eight months investigating the claims against Green. But on Tuesday, it was prevented from revealing the existence of a string of non-disclosure deals after a ruling by senior judge Sir Terence Etherton, the Master of the Rolls.  Green hired a team of seven lawyers and reportedly spent nearly pound, on legal fees. But Labour minister Lord Hain told the Lords: “I had been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful shybusinessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying. “I feel it’s my duty under shyparliamentary privilege to name Philip Green as the inidual in shyquestion given that the media have been subject to an shyinjunction preventing shypublication of the full details of this story which is clearly in the public interest.” Lord Hain said later: “I’m not disputing judges’ shyresponsibilities or timing or anything like that, that’s a matter for the judiciary. “I’m just charging my duty as a parliamentarian and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse. “And that was what led me to act in the way that I did.”  Arcadia chief Green broke his silence last night to insist: “To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations.” The interim court injunction made it illegal to reveal Green’s identity or name his companies, as well as details of the claims against him. The -page ruling states that in five cases “substantial payments” were made to five people who accused Green of “discreditable conduct”. It added: “In all five cases the complaints were compromised by settlement agreements under which shysubstantial payments were made to the complainants.”  Under these shyagreements “both sides undertook to keep confidential the subject matter of the complaints”. The ruling did not shyidenty any iniduals but stated that “the most serious allegations of specic and particularised incidents are denied” by the businessman. Theprovided the court with “no corroboration of those incidents but only the allegations of the employees”. A previous High Court ruling, which could only be reported this week, found in favour of the , stating that “in all the circumstances, the public interest in publication outweighs any confidentiality attaching to the information”. But the Appeal Court ruled this week the judge “left out of account the important and legitimate role played by non-disclosure shyagreements in the consensual shysettlement of disputes”. It ruled: “There is a real prospect that publication by thewill cause immediate, substantial and possibly irreversible harm to all of the claimants.” Green’s lawyers Schillings have worked for shyCristiano Ronaldo, Lance Armstrong and Ryan Giggs, all who have used NDAs or shyinjunctions to silence those accusing them of wrongdoing.

MPs today warn the Department for Work and Pensionsappears to be turning a “deaf ear” to these concerns. The Public Accounts Committee said the Tory “fortress mentality” is failing claimants who are struggling to adapt.It added: “The introduction of Universal Credit is causing unacceptable hardship and dficulties for many of the claimants it was designed to help.”A “department in denial” cannot learn from mistakes and the culture needs to change, the PAC said.  It said: “The department’s systemic culture of denial and defensiveness in the face of any adverse evidence presented by others is a signicant risk to the programme.” The committee added: “Unless the department learns to listen, it will not be able to adapt the programme to make it a success.” Universal Credit, which is being rolled out gradually, replaces six existing benefits with a single payment - but critics have argued the programme, which has been subject to several delays, is flawed. Some . million people are expected to be on Universal Credit by  - but the PAC said there is a “real risk that we will see claimants facing hardship on a much larger scale”. The PAC said the DWP has persistently dismissed evidence Universal Credit is causing hardship for claimants and additional burdens for local organisations and “refuses to measure what it does not want to see”. Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: “This report provides further damning evidence of a culture of indference at DWP - a department disturbingly adrt from the real-world problems of the people it is there to support. “Its apparent determination to turn a deaf ear to the concerns of claimants, frontline organisations and Parliament is of real concern. The culture needs to change. “A department in denial cannot learn from its mistakes and take the action necessary to address the desperate hardship suffered by many Universal Credit claimants.”  She said the department’s “painfully slow approach to correcting underpayments, years after it accepted responsibility, indicated weaknesses at the highest levels of management”. Ms Hillier added: “As a priority the department must demonstrate a tangible sht in the way it listens and responds to feedback and evidence.” She said a recent Government announcement of changes to the rollout of Universal Credit “offers no guarantee that the problems facing claimants will be resolved”. Universal Credit is taking too long to pay people the money they need to live on, the PAC said, adding food bank use has increased more rapidly in areas where Universal Credit has been rolled out. The proportion of claimants paid in full and on time must be signicantly improved and methods for measuring claimants’ hardship should be established, the PAC said. It said the package of support to help claimants adjust to Universal Credit is “not fit for purpose”. Personal budgeting support is often offered to claimants when they are already in debt and may not include debt advice. The report was released as Citizens Advice said single disabled people could lose out under Universal Credit under a range of circumstances. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Even when disabled people do get the support meant for them under Universal Credit, whether they are in work or not, they can be hundreds of pounds worse off a month than the previous system. “This is money people desperately need to cover their bills.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a coppers copper count scotland","story":"NewsA coppers copper - the Count of Scotland Yard Herbert Hannam who helped send a double killer to the hangmans nooseHerbert Hannam was the policeman who helped send the man behind double murder to the gallows and forged a career as a tough law enforcerShareCommentsByStephen Wade:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsHannam was known as The Count of Scotland Yard \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTop coppers, as well as lowly constables, are equally tried and tested in a courtroom. Legal process and smart performers in the drama of a trial will catch them out. But Bert Hannam, in his long career, would match any barrister, and survive cross-examination with a flair and panache that won him admirers, but also made some enemies. It was March,  in Number One court at the Old Bailey and the man in the dock was a family doctor, being tried for murder. The previous year was free of hangings, as the pressure for reform and for abolition of the death penalty was gaining momentum, but now here was John Bodkin Adams , long-serving doctor in Eastbourne, being potentially the first person hanged after the year when the public executioner was rested from his duties.The police officer charged with the task of gathering evidence against Adams was one of the Yard’s top detectives, Bert Hannam. The sleuth and his team were faced with the task of crossing swords with a brilliant defence barrister, Geoffrey Lawrence, and Lawrence has fastened on one meeting of Hannam with Adams which was, as the detective stated, a ‘chance meeting’ at which searching questions had been asked.  Lawrence had already made the medical experts called by the prosecution look hopelessly inept, and Bart knew he was in for a tough time. He was cool, controlled and ready with factual details which explained away the chance meeting as nothing sinister or threatening to the doctor.Hannam, ‘The Count of Scotland Yard’ came through and held his own with a brilliant legal brain. The Yard had had learned this the hard way. Starting as a young copper in the late twenties, he worked his way through the ranks during the war and proved his mettle in cases of theft, fraud and corruption. He was not noticed by the press though, until the notorious Teddington Towpath murders in the summer of  when the world could talk of nothing  but the coronation and the royal family. Alfred Whiteway had raped and killed two young women on the towpath, and Hannam found himself leading a murder investigation, after playing second fiddle to other men, gather valuable experience and acquiring the confidence and the professional skills involved in dealing with serious crime. He got his man, but again, his main obstacle was a courtroom tussle, brought out when it was known that a constable had taken away the murder weapon in the police car, back to his home. Bert Hannam, by the time he faced the formidable Geoffrey Lawrence, was the man the Yard brought in to sort things out. In the Towpath murder trial there was an allegation from Whiteway that his confession had been forced from him.Hannam, the defence lawyer put it to Hannam that the confession was ‘completely manufactured’ and Hannam, unflustered and calm, said simply but with authority, ‘That is absolutely untrue.’ ‘The Count’ was a man with charisma.  He was meticulously concerned with his appearance, his manner and his confidence as a man who would inspire confidence and trust. When he went north to lead the investigation into the brutal murder of an aged shop-keeper in Halax, Emily Pye, the local paper was impressed and their account of him makes clear the power of the man’s presence, And in an interview with a reporter we have a brief instance of his matter-of –fact efficiency: The Scotland Yard chief... made a special appeal to Halax people for information about anyone who was not at home between  noon and three p.m. on Saturday. I know this sounds like an enormous task but I would like to see them all the same. This was a most terrible crime. The woman was really brutally attacked. Bert Hannam was a man who cultivated the habit of having men working with him who could be trusted to absorb and apply his methods, and these were always carefully planned and discussed. He had learned from the best, and he had been compelled to conduct investigations in wartime, in the heart of the Blitz, where he made many friends working in the criminal justice system, including the brilliant Molly Lefebure, assistant to Dr Keith Simpson, the Home Office pathologist. He was not the most forthcoming person when faced with the curiosity of the media, and his arch-enemy was Percy Hoskins, chief crime reporter of The Express. Percy took against the extreme thoroughness of Bert’s gathering of evidence of Adams the higher echelons of the judiciary and leaders of the government were faced with the potential hanging of a family doctor and Hoskins began to see Bert’s determined and prolonged search for evidence as a witch-hunt against a man who was easing the passing of people near death.  One way or another, the victory in court, keeping Adams out of the death cell and from the end of a rope, had to happen. In an age when detectives were glamorous and beginning to appear on radio and television dramas, Bert Hannam merely got on with the job in hand and never succumbed to the vain courting of celebrity.He had that most valuable of detective capabilities: discretion. What is not widely known about the man is his participation in currency regulation investigation in the immediate post-war years. He was not merely an officer linked to murder cases far from it in fact, because he always acquired what we would now call a wide portfolio of expertise on his c.v. He learned fast and he understood that he was working at a time when police corruption was in the air as well as in the news. Even the fact that took part in enquiries regarding this corruption could have given him a tainted image. But he kept to professional actions and attitudes and pressed on with duties regardless of criticisms. In the s, when Britain was still slowly and painfully recovering from the deprivations and sufferings of the war, the police were gradually reformed and reorganised. New strategies of police training came along, to replace the Trenchard measures of the pre-war years, Bert Hannam became something of a consultant and mentor, and his son was to later become the man who ran the new college. The Hannam name was firmly placed in recent police history.

The Google memo said: We are dead serious about making sure we provide a safe and inclusive workplace.We want to assure you that we review every single complaint about sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct, we investigate and we take action. In recent years, weve made a number of changes, including taking an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority: in the last two years,  people have been terminated for sexual harassment, including  who were senior managers and above.

Controlling John McLaughlin even quit his job so he could sit outside Devon Brown’s work for eight hours and monitor her every move. And inside the house they shared he fitted a CCTV camera after becoming so convinced the mum-of-one was having an affair. The -year-old also left booby traps and hacked the black box in Devons car to track her movements.  Police uncovered McLaughlin’s bizarre behaviour when they were called to deal with a domestic violence incident. At first, -year-old Devon, from Wigan, thought McLaughlin was insecure and tried to overlook his behaviour until it spiralled out of control. She said: “He was never violent or aggressive. He never even raised his voice. But he controlled me completely. It was mental torture and eventually I had a breakdown.  “I actually bought the handcuffs on Valentine’s Day to spice up our relationship, just as a bit of fun. “But John became so controlling and possessive that we ended up handcuffed together, lying in bed, so that he could keep a check on me. “He gave up his job so that he could keep an eye on me. He would sit outside my work for eight hours at a time. “He even checked my underwear at the end of the day to make sure I hadn’t been having sex with my colleagues.  The couple met in June last year while Devon was working as a letting agent and John came in to rent a house. She said: “I fancied him straightaway, he had gorgeous green eyes and I fell for him. It was very romantic and exciting.”After being charmed by McLaughlin, the pair began dating on Halloween last year.Devon said: “John was lovely, a real gentleman, and so caring and affectionate. I had a little girl, Ellie, and he was brilliant with her, reading her bedtime stories, cooking meals and planning days out.  He had a good job as an engineer, and he seemed like the perfect catch.” In January this year, the couple moved in together. But their relationship immediately showed signs of cracking. Devon explained: “John would meet me every day after work, which I thought was lovely at first. ButI tried to make any other arrangement, he would go mad. He insisted on collecting me from work and then taking me home, and I realised he wanted to keep a check on me. “I just thought he was a bit insecure.  “I loved him so much, and my daughter adored him, and so I was desperate to make things work.” But John then began accusing Devon of having an affair with their neighbour. Devon said: “Our neighbour was married and middle aged, he was a mate of my dad’s. He was in no way flirty or inappropriate. “But John was convinced I was having an affair with him and that we were meeting up secretly during the night. “He started jamming paper on the top of our doors, so he would knowthey had been opened during the night. He would leave his phone on record all night, to catch anyone sneaking into the house.  I tried to reason with him, but it was no good. I even bought a CCTV camera, to show him I had nothing to hide. But John set the camera up to film inside our living room. He spent hours and hours checking the tape, trying to catch me out. “If there was any sort of glitch on the tape, he would accuse me of stopping it whilst I had sex with the neighbour. “I had a black box fitted to my car, for the insurance, and John hacked into it and followed everything I did. I couldn’t even drive to the corner shop without him demanding an explanation. “If I went to see my mum or my sister I had to send him a selfie, to prove where I was. “I had bought a pair of handcuffs for John, for Valentine’s Day, just for a bit of a laugh. I was trying to make our relationship fun again.  “But John accused me constantly of having affairs. “My best friend asked me to her bridesmaid and he accused me of knocking off her fiance, that same day. He accused me of having affairs with our friends, neighbours, and the men who worked at a factory down the road. He even accused me of having an affair with his own dad! “In the end, I said to him: ‘Why don’t you handcuff me  That will prove my point.’ But John actually took it seriously and we went to bed handcuffed to each other, so that he could monitor my movements.  “I lay there for hours and eventually it was his decision to release me because he couldn’t sleep.” McLaughlin also gave up his job so that he could monitor Devon’s movements full time. She added: “He would call and text me all day at work. Once he sat outside my work, from am to pm, in my car. He was really starting to worry me and I pleaded with him to stop. “After work, he would insist on inspecting my knickers, to checkI’d been having sex at work. It was degrading. I was starting to lose my confidence and the stress was really getting to me.  “I wasn’t allowed to take my phone with me upstairs, in case I was texting another man. He would even wait for me outside the toilet. “He would say ‘You’re mine and only mine.’ He refused to share me – even with my family. In the end, I gave up my job, because I just couldn’t cope. “But even with me at home full time, he was still full of accusations. “My family could see he was a destructive force but I was completely under his control. I had totally lost sight of the girl I had once been.  At the end of May, Devon decided to end the relationship, but John refused to accept it. Devon said: “We had a huge row and I tried to get out of the house but he wouldn’t let me go. He pushed me and he smashed me over the head with a can. The police came and he was arrested.” McLaughlin appeared before magistrates in July and pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend and engaging in controlling or coercive behaviour between January  and June . He will be sentenced at the end of the month at Bolton Crown Court. Devon is now in a new relationship and wants other women and men to know that evena partner isn’t physically assaulting them they could still be abusing them. She added: “I thought I loved him, but I didn’t. I was vulnerable at the time, having some problems, and he took advantage of me. “He’s a monster.”If you are being abused contact the National Domestic Abuse Violence freephone helpline on   ."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan harry instantly transported back","story":"NewsMeghan and Harry are instantly transported back to their wedding day by this one thingHarry makes the revelation in the audio commentary notes for a new Windsor Castle exhibition about his weddingShareCommentsByTony Jones:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghans-dress-goes-display-royal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duke of Sussex has revealed he picked the poignant music his we walked down the aisle to - and it will forever transport them back to that moment.

Something that epitomises the whole day, the whole feeling that I have for her, and this incredibly impactful music with no organ whatsoever, with a soloist who actually did the most incredible job, to the orchestra.

The Duchess of Sussex wore a striking floor- white dress to attend a reception and dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The incredible dress is by New York based fashion label THEIA under Irish creative director Don ONeill. Don, , has been speaking about his experience with the dress after he was reportedly contacted by Meghans stylist last month. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Royal Tour: Best photos from Day  of Duke and Duchess trip The designer said he sent the dress to the palace within two days, but was asked for it to be remade with extra seam allowance. We knew immediately why this extra allowance was required, but Mums the word, he told FEMAIL. It wasnt until several weeks later that the news of the couples pregnancy was announced to the world, so it would appear the dress designer had to keep the secret to himself.  The brand is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia and the dress itself featured cap sleeves and beaded detailing on the shoulders. The website states: Inspired by the Greek Goddess THEIA, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, THEIA who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant.  She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears THEIA will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

No, its not that Meghans left the tag on her clothing again - but it is to do with the Duchess. It appears the Duchess of Sussex is almost always photographed walking slightly behind her husband - even when theyre holding hands. And etiquette expert William Hanson has suggested an interesting explanation for this - and its all to do with respect.  Eagle-eyed royal fans have spotted that during the course of their overseas tour to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. the parents-to-be have barely left each others side. But even when theyre together at engagements, its always seems to be Harry taking the lead - hes quite literally one step ahead. Mr Hanson believes this is because Meghan isnt a royal by blood. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: It is standard practice for British royalty to allow the blood royal to walk or stand a few paces in front of the royalty who has married in to the family, as with HM The Queen and HRH The Duke of Edinburgh and TRH The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  Even though TRH the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are currently presenting their own, informal, tactile interpretation of British monarchy, they are still adhering to the precedent with Meghan knowing she, as a non-blood royal, should defer to born royalty. The royal couple, who married in May, might be following protocol in this instance, but there have been several notable occasions on their tour when theyve both broken the rules. This has included, hugging members of the public instead of giving them a handshake and taking selfies with royal fans. As well as breaking official rules, theyve also done several things that may be frowned upon by more senior members of the royal family.

It was just ridiculous. I would eat anything and everything, just as much as I could.

At one time, business titan Sir Philip Green counted Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Campbell and Simon Cowell among his A-list friends. And he has been pictured at countless events with his arms draped around the likes of Liz Hurley, Kate Moss, Beyonce and Cara Delevingne. The tycoon enjoys the trappings of his enormous wealth and is not shy about showing it off. He commutes to London by private jet from his home in Monaco and stays in his own suite at The Dorchester hotel in posh Mayfair.  His vast personal fortune comes from building a retail empire that stretched from Topshop and Topman to Burton and Miss Selfridge. But his crown slipped with the doomed sale of BHS to investors with no retail experience in . A year later the department store went to the wall with , job losses and a poundmillion pension fund black hole. After y talks, and a storm of criticism, Green agreed a poundmillion settlement with regulators. Yet it was not enough to restore the image of a man who, in , was knighted for services to retail by then Prime Minister Tony Blair. Green was born into a well-off family from North London in March . His mum Alma built a buy-to-let property business and dad Simon’s firm repaired radios and rented out TVs. But a book published earlier this year by journalist Oliver Shah claims Green’s upbringing was “emotionally barren”.  It claims Alma “starved her children of affection, relentlessly drilling into them the importance of making money above all ” and played them off against each other to “toughen them”. Green was just  when his father died, aged only . After leaving school, he forged a career in business. He started out working for a shoe-importing firm and began to rake in money through a series of shrewd business deals. But not all of his brash deal-making paid off. In the early s he opened a discshyount designer shop in Mayfair, West London, and persuaded Joan Collins to collaborate on a denim range. Green boasted of booming orders, but the range flopped and had to be sold off at huge discounts. Nevertheless he quickly bounced back. The opulence and extravagance of Green’s lestyle are typied by his birthday celebrations. For his th,  guests were flown on a private plane to a luxury hotel in Cyprus. He was lavished with gts including a solid gold Monopoly set with real money from we Tina, a Harley Davidson and a Ferrari.  Messages came from stars including Britney Spears and Sylvester Stallone, who reportedly told him: “Men don’t really become sexy until they’re .” The celebrations, said to have cost poundmillion, culminated in an infamous toga party, with Green dressed like Emperor Nero as rocker Rod Stewart performed on stage. His th birthday party in  was even more ostentatious and rumoured to have cost poundmillion. Held in the Males, it featured live performances from Gladys Knight  the Pips, George Michael and Jenner Lopez. For his th in , just four years before BHS collapsed, Green had a poundmillion four-day bash in Mexico. Guests danced on the beach to performances by Stevie Wonder and Robbie Williams. Green also lavished money on select friends, including flying over Earth, Wind and Fire for Cowell’s th bash in London.  Richard Caring, owner of high-end restaurant The Ivy, was once a good friend and a major supplier to his fashion empire. He received poundmillion in payouts during the early days of Green’s ownership of BHS. Green has also indulged his passion for superyachts, with the poundmillion Lionheart the latest. The ostentatious interior was designed by we Tina who, along with his mother, has been an big influence. George Maude, a business associate of Green’s, has said: “Tina was a bit like Philip what she wanted, she tried very hard to get. She wanted Philip and she tried every which way to get him.” They married after five years, in , apparently when Tina became pregnant with their daughter Chloe. They went on to have a son, Brandon. Tina now controls the family holding company, Taveta Investments, and has been a staunch defender of her husband over the years.  Fashion designer Chloe, , has raised eyebrows with her relationship with “Hot Felon” Jeremy Meeks, . They had a son, Jayden, in May. Along with Green’s reputation for big spending, he is known for his explosive outbursts. I, like many other journalists, have been on the receiving end while covering the BHS collapse. Yet what has been conspicuous since the controversy around the chain’s demise is the lack of celebrity friends willing to back him in public. Cowell, for example, hasn’t spoken to him for almost three years.  Friends say the music mogul lost all respect for Green over the way he dealt with the BHS pension crisis. Green’s th, at The Dorchester’s China Tang restaurant, was mooted by his standards, with guests entertained by Dynamo. But with questions over Green’s empire, it seems the bullish billionaire may have lost his own once-legendary magic touch.

Sarahs uncle today revealed it was the first time he had ever known Anthony Wellgreen, , to cry. Bus driver Keith Wellgreen said he is absolutely gutted her disappearance is being investigated as a potential murder. He last saw the mother of five at his brother Ronalds th birthday party in November . The -year-old from Fareham, Hants, said: I find it very upsetting - you just never think it is going to happen to a member of your own family.  Ive been thinking over the past couple of days of going up to Kent myself over the weekend to help look for her. A lot of our family only meet up at weddings, funerals and occasional birthdays but I speak to my brothers Ronald and Anthony once or twice a week. I might not have seen Sarah often, but shes still my niece and Im absolutely gutted. When I spoke to Anthony at the weekend I couldnt understand a word he was saying because he had burst into tears - Ive never seen or heard him cry before. Mr Wellgreen added that Sarah would not have missed her childs birthday on purpose - after it was revealed one of her children has had a birthday while she has been missing. He said: I know damn well Sarah loves her kids and wouldnt have missed a birthday on purpose. Ive seen lots of pictures on Facebook of them all on holiday together having a good time, so its all very strange. I still hope shes alive - andshe is alive somewhere, I really hope she gets in contact with the family soon.  It comes as Sarahs eldest son begged shysearchers to “bring my mum home”. Lewis Burdett, , made the appeal as volunteers helping police scour countryside were told to look for the mum-of-five’s mobile phone. Sharon Brine who has been coordinating the community hunt for Sarah, , said: “We’re now looking for a body really. We want to find her and get closure for her children. Lewis is besides himself.” The police search was today extended to Dartford town centre, eight miles from Sarah’s home in tiny New Ash Green, Kent.  Lewis and his brother Jack, , both from Sarah’s previous marriage, are said to be looking after their mum’s three younger children, one aged  and twins aged six. One of Sarah’s neighbours said: “We’re fearing the worst now. It’s a terrible situation. “It’s a very disturbing time. They were such a happy family, it’s been really shocking. Everybody is talking about it. “Sarah was very close to her children. She wouldn’t just leave them and not say anything after all of this time. She was a very proud mum and she loved her children.”  It was rumoured today that CCTV cameras on the front of Sarah’s house were turned off the night she disappeared. Kent Police did not comment on the claims. Last week a man in his s was arrested and bailed in connection with the disappearance.

The Duchess of Sussex, , was adamant on three specic details she wanted the exquisite gown to feature as she knew her wedding to Prince Harry, , would be watched by the eyes of the world. The Givenchy dress took , hours - equivalent to  days - to make by a team of . And when Meghan walked down the aisle of St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle on May  she looked every inch the perfect bride.  Pregnant Meghan said designer Clare Waight Keller respected her vision for the dress, from the shape of the neckline to theof the sleeves - and recognised the importance of tailoring as the outfit had to be modest. But Meghan insisted the dress should have a bateau neckline, cropped sleeves, and a timeless feeling. The bridal gown is the star attraction of a new Windsor Castle exhibition about the royal wedding, which includes audio commentary recorded for visitors by the duke and duchess. Touching stories behind the couples big day are revealed, from Harry joking about joining the Queen and Meghan for a meeting to choose a tiara, to how a cold Easter meant there were less flowers to pick for his wes wedding bouquet.  Meghan says in the commentary: I had a very clear vision of what I wanted for the day, and what I wanted the dress to look like, and so what was amazing in working with Clare is that sometimes youll find designers try to push you in a dferent direction. But she just completely respected what I wanted to see for the day, and she wanted to bring that to le for me. So I knew at the onset I wanted a bateau neckline, I wanted a cropped sleeve, I wanted a very timeless, classic feeling and, obviously with respect to the environment we were in and St Georges Chapel, being really modest in what it would look like, I knew that the tailoring was so key, because the dress itself would be so covered up.  Meghan says in the commentary she had followed Clare Waight Kellers career for a long time and she ticked all the boxes from being British, to reflect the duchess new home, and a woman, to working for Givenchy as artistic director, a global fashion house which added an international dimension to the big day. Meghans five-metre long silk tulle veil was also embroidered with flowers from each of the  Commonwealth nations. The dress luminosity is down to the double-bonded silk cady - fabric woven on both sides of the loom - which catches the light. Speaking in the commentary Meghan adds: There was a great level of detail that went into the planning of our wedding day.  I think for us, we knew how large the scale of the event would be, so in making choices that were really personal and meaningful, it could make the whole experience feel intimate, even though it was a very big wedding. On her wedding day, Meghan wore Queen Marys diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, lent to the duchess by the Queen, which is part of the exhibition. The duchess described her visit to the head of state to choose a headpiece as an incredibly surreal day. The duke, who joined Meghan for the visit to the Queen, joked in the commentary: Every girls dream to be able to try on a tiara, and, funnily enough, the one that suited the best, the one that looked the best on you without question, I shouldnt have really even been there, but such an incredible loan by my grandmother, it was very sweet.  The brides bouquet, which featured a number of plants and flowers including sweet peas and sprigs of myrtle, was designed by florist Philippa Craddock and has been recreated using articial silk flowers for the exhibition which opens on Friday. The duke and duchess said cold weather earlier in the year meant there were less flowers available for the wedding bouquet from their cottage garden at Kensington Palace. Meghan revealed they had been doing some planting in the fall and said the duke made a really beautul gesture by picking blooms for her on their wedding day.  Harry added: We didnt have as many flowers in our little garden as we had hoped for because I think it snowed at Easter. That kind of ruined the whole thing. But, theyre very much a bouquet of wild flower, wild flower meadows and making sure that we had forget-me-nots in as it was one of my mothers favourite flowers... The dukes Household Cavalry frockcoat made for the wedding is not available for the exhibition but another identical one owned by Harry has been loaned for the display  Also on display are the wedding outfits worn by pageboy Prince George, a miniature version of Harrys coat, and bridesmaid Princess Charlotte, an ivory silk dress by Clare Waight Keller. Harry joked: We had  bridesmaids, page boys under the age of seven which everybody says is impossible to have them behaving, but they did it. Meghan quipped: It was a miracle.

Ben McCabe, , who needs treatment every day for his burns, has shared a heartbreaking warning ahead of the popular annual event. He urged: I want people to think about the consequences of setting off these fireworks and how easy it is for something to go wrong - when you dont know what to do. Ben was just four years old when he was left screaming in agony as the firework came hurtling towards him and set his shirt on fire.  He had been watching the pyrotechnics with dad Alan in the suburban cul-de-sac where they live in Glasgow, on November , . After being struck by the firework, Bens dad rushed him into the house and put him in a cold bath, calling we Amy to tell her what had happened. Ben then spent three weeks in hospital and was left with third degree burns and needing skin grafts across his chest and neck. The brave schoolboy says he now copes with the annual event by pretending its just another day.  Last bonfire night I managed to make it to the door to look outside but Im still very scared of them, he said. I usually sit in my room and pretend its just another day. Mum Amy, , who had just clocked onto a sht as a nurse at Glasgows Royal Hospital for Sick Children, recalled the terrying incident. She said: The firework headed straight for Ben and went into his shirt which then caught alight.  He was screaming so loud and no one could believe what had just happened. Alan put him into a cold bath until the ambulance came - there was nothing left of his shirt. Amy ran down the hospital corridor to the AE department to meet the ambulance and spent the next three weeks by Bens bedside. As a parent it was killing me inside seeing him like that. I had to try and keep calm for the family - and for Ben, she said.  He was in hospital for  days and still needs skin grafts and massages four times a day to keep the skins elasticity and that can be really hard going. I am so very proud of my son - he is so much braver than me, and anyone I know. But after the initial horror of the accident and the subsequent medical treatment, the family had to live with the prospect that Ben would be scarred for le - and deal with how it would affect his confidence.  Amy, who now works as a dental technician, said: I was worried about what people would say when they saw his scars and how he would react. There was an incident at the swimming pool when he had his pressure garment on and some boys were staring at him and shouting stuff to him. I was looking around for their parents and at the same time worrying what this would do to Ben. He came over to me and said Mum can you take the garment off - so I did.  He put his chin up and walked past these boys bearing his scars with this presence that made my heart skip a beat of pride. He is so much braver than me. The family found support from The Scottish Burned Childrens Club, and Amy said: Ben is so much more confident and determined and wants to help others. He has an amazing network of friends through the club and I cant describe how much it has helped him.  For myself it has been a Godsend to meet other families with similar stories - to know you are not on your own and that you are actually doing OK. Its like a new family and a forever connection that no one  can understand. You cant buy the support. Deputy Assistant Chief Officer for Prevention and Protection John Miller said: Bonfire Night is typically the services busiest night of the year.  We are appealing to the public to attend organised events rather than do-it-yourself bonfires and fireworks displays. Our firefighters work extremely hard to engage with people of all ages and equip them with the knowledge and the awareness of how to stay safe around bonfires and fireworks.

Thomas has made more approaches to Kensington Palace and even appealed to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who married Prince Harry and Meghan, for help. And sources say his anger at being cut out of his daughter’s le is such that he may even hire a legal team to force visits through the courts.  A source said: “The palace is acutely aware of what problems could lie ahead with Thomas. He strongly believes the baby should be as much a part of his le as they will be Prince Charles’s. “Thomas says the Markle blood will be as much in the child’s veins as the ‘blue blood’ of the royals and he has ‘rights’.

Thomas has reached out to Kensington Palace more so since news of Meghan’s pregnancy broke, hoping the baby will be what finally breaks their estrangement.” He has offered to fly to the UKhe can sit down with Meghan and Harry, , when theyfrom their royal tour of Australia. His push comes as Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, may be poised to move from Los Angeles to be nearer during the pregnancy. Thomas learned Meghan was expecting when he heard it on his car radio.  He said: “The first thing I thought about was holding Meghan as a newborn. I thought, ‘My baby is having a baby’. A baby is a blessing and I look forward to seeing a little Meghan or a little Harry.” Friends of the retired film lighting technician claim he would even like the baby to be called ThomasMeghan has a boy. His only son is also called Thomas.  Meghan has not spoken to her dad since her wedding in May. Thomas failed to attend after being declared too unwell to travel following heart palpitations.

An agreement was reached to allow them to use the space at certain times and that has gone some way to curbing the problems.“An area the size of Camperdown is very hard to police and we certainly don’t want people riding down nature trails in the park.“It would seem to be a sensible option to try to work with the riders to find a safe area for them to use.”Strathmartine councillor Stewart Hunter said he was happy to look at finding a solution to an “old problem”.He said: “In my time as a councillor there has always been a problem with scrambler bikes.“The police do all they can butthere was a place where the riders could go it would certainly make a lot of sense.“The problem is finding a suitable location that is safe and secluded.”Fellow area councillor Ian Borthwick said the latest incident was another example of “reckless” behaviour by those involved.He added: “I will certainly bring this latest incident to the attention of the authorities.“I’ve been made aware of issues in the park in the past.”Alan Ross, convener of the city council’s community safety and public protection committee, urged anyone who witnesses antisocial behaviour involving scrambler bikes to contact the police or the community safety wardens.He added: “This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and is a blight on our communities.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/10/Jimmy-Carr.jpg.jpg ","title":"comedian jimmy carr coming to dundee","story":"Comedian Jimmy Carr is performing in Dundee. vw, px\"  The TV star is bringing his Terribly Funny tour to Caird Hall on Friday September  The  Out of  Cats host will make jokes #about all kinds of terrible things#, according to publicity.#Terrible things that might have affected you or people you know and love.#But they’re just jokes # they are not the terrible things.#Having political correctness at a comedy show is like having health and safety at a rodeo.#Now you’ve been warned, buy a ticket.#Tickets go on sale tomorrow at Dundee Box Office."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bcee1f8093d1-e1540285944998-785x564.jpg ","title":"george cran roles reversed as pressure now on dunfermline and allan johnston as dundee united look to gather momentum","story":"With the first quarter of the season behind them, it’s fair to say it’s been a bumpy ride so far for Dundee United.Often coaches will use this point of the campaign as the first real chance to assess how things are going as they prepare to meet sides for the second time in the league.For the Tangerines, though, a report card right now can’t possibly tell the whole story with Csaba Laszlo not even lasting to this marker in charge of the team.And to judge his replacement Robbie Neilson after just two matches in charge wouldn’t be fair.However, comparing the fortunes of their next opponents Dunfermline since they met on the opening league match of the season makes for interesting reading.That’s because the atmosphere around Allan Johnston’s Pars since they finally overturned a -match winless run against the Tangerines to continue a lightning-fast start to the campaign has flipped almost completely.While the Tangerines struggled and stumbled under Csaba’s reign at the start of the season, Johnston was enjoying seeing his side inflict a - win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

down as Jambos skipper Steven Naismith found the back of the next.The start to the second half was even worse as Steven MacLean made it - just  seconds after the restart and put the game beyond the home team.The lapses that led to all three goals were frustrating for Jim but at least he felt able to praise some of the work put in, particularly in the first half.“The players showed plenty of character at -

You’ve got to make sure you are taking the game to them as well.“I felt they did that on a number of occasions and we drove Hearts back and created opportunities. When you get those opportunities that lts the belief to go to the next level.“Obviously the penalty is the biggest chance and we have a great chance with a head as well and we should have done better at that.“The pleasing thing is we didn’t crumble and feel sorry for ourselves.”Things don’t get any easier for Jim and his players and after a free weekend, next up at Dens Park are Champions Celtic a week tonight.After that one comes what is already looking a massive clash at Motherwell on Saturday week."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

As it stands, maternity leave begins when the child is born.Hazel got the inspiration for her campaign after her son Logan was born seven weeks early and spent time in the neonatal unit at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital.Hazel and her husband David, both , were allowed to take him home two weeks later, but it got her thinking about other families, who can spend months in the hospital.Hazel, who works as an in-house legal counsel, said: “While we were in the neonatal unit we met so many other families – some with babies much more premature or sick than Logan. As you can imagine, it was a very stressful and emotional environment.“We were not expecting our baby to arrive so early and were really just going through the motions in hospital.“Nobody plans on having their baby in the neonatal unit, and I can tell you it’s stressful enough without having the additional worry about wages and the pressure put on partners having to make dficult decisions over whether to exhaust their paternity leave or annual leave holidays,they have any, or beg for compassionate leave before their babies are even home.“Personally I believe any time spent for either parent in a neonatal unit with premature babies should be paid and it should not impact either parent’s entitlement to leave.“The mother should still have her full entitlement when she gets home, as should the partner.”Luckily for Hazel and David, from Bridge of Don, Logan is now happy and healthy, but they are aware that this isn’t the case for everyone, and the maternity and paternity leave rules can make an already stressful situation worse.Hazel hopes the Scottish Government will consider extra leave for families who have a premature baby.She added: “My petition is aimed at premature babies, but as others have highlighted, this is also an issue faced by parents of sick babies. The introduction of paternity leave and shared parental leave is great but this is still an area the UK could improve upon.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Ensuring parents are well supported during the early stages of family le is also key to improving outcomes for all our children.“We believe everyone should have access to reasonable support from employers when they become parents.“Although the relevant legal powers are currently reserved to Westminster, we are committed to promoting and supporting flexible working, particularly for parents whose babies are born prematurely or require additional support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"drivers urged to take alternative route as section of busy aberdeen road down to one lane","story":"Drivers are being urged to find an alternative route tonight after an oil spill on an Aberdeen road.A section of the southbound lane on Wellington Road has been closed due to the leak from a broken down crane.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray centenary poppy display takes shape","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAhead of the th anniversary of the end of the First World War, the people of Inveraray and surrounding areas have been hand-knitting poppies for display in and around Glenaray and Inveraray Church.The poppies will be displayed inside and outside the church from Monday November  until the week following the Armistice Day commemoration.Also to mark the anniversary, Inveraray and District History Society has arranged for the widely acclaimed #Home Fires, Broken Sons# drama to be presented at Inveraray Church Hall on Tuesday November  at .pm.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car.

have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring

As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much. They are actually meeting up and having their version of a ceilidh!"},{"url":null,"title":"pass-the-parcel-over-new-railway-station-for-east-linton","story":"A campaign has been ongoing for nearly two decades, with the earliest opening of the station thought to be .However, fears have repeatedly been raised that the timeline could change, with the opening of the station, along with one at Reston in the Scottish Borders, slipping further down the line.Transport Scotland has stressed the plans remain ldquoon schedule and the commitment to the scheme is ldquounwavering.Tom Thorburn, chairman of Rail Action Group East of Scotland , aired his frustrations at RAGESrsquo AGM last month.He said: ldquoWe have been campaigning for these stations to open for nearly  years.ldquoWe have been shunted from one Transport Minister to another with delaying tactics from each so that no firm decision is taken when our new stations will happen.Various discussions have taken place with a succession of Transport Ministers since , when Stewart Stevenson MSP, according to Mr Thorburn, confirmed that a second Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidancewould not be required as the case for the Edinburgh to Berwick local service with a re-opened station at East Linton was so strong.However, since then, progress has been slow, with still no date confirmed for when work could begin on the station.Already, East Lothian Council has agreed to put forward more than pound million for the station, with Scottish Borders Council doing similar for the station at Reston.The new East Linton station would not be on the site of the former station there, which closed in , and instead would be to the west.Mr Thorburn said: ldquoThere is now a sixth Transport Minister, Michael Matheson, and when I tried to make an appointment to see him, his staff said his diary was full.ldquoWe have no way of knowing when our stations will happen ndash will it be by  or will they drop off Network Railrsquos agenda altogether ldquoIt seems that it is a lsquopass the parcelrsquo exercise from one minister to the next and East Linton and Reston stations are not seen as a high priority project by the Scottish Government.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said: ldquoIt was agreed by the Scottish Government and East Lothian Council that East Linton station will be delivered during the next railway investment periodas part of a larger programme of works to enhance the East Coast Main Line.

Members are drawn from local residents, licensees, health professionals and police.The board, which approved its new revised licensing policy for the next five years at a meeting earlier in the morning, scrapped the overprovision statement.Forum member Elizabeth Oldcorn said the decision was ldquodisappointing and against the views of the forum and the NHS, which she represents on it.She said: ldquoI think the board has done itself a disservice.And concerns were raised that not having an overprovision statement ndash which allows the board to reject licence applications from new premises on the argument an area already has enough premises ndash left it vulnerable.Forum convenor George Hood warned: ldquoI thinkyou do not have an overprovision statement you will find it very dficult not to grant a licence.The board argued that, while there were ldquosignicant health and crime problems in our communities that should not be ignored and ldquoaccess to alcohol is a key issue, it did not believe the harm caused by alcohol in East Lothian was a ldquodirect and sole consequence of the number of premises.Councillor Jane Henderson, board member, said: ldquoWe have to be absolutely certain about the causal link.Rudi Fruzynski, the boardrsquos licensing standards officer, said that one of the issues was a lack of guidance from the Scottish Government as to what qualied as overprovision.He said: ldquoThere has not been clear guidance from the Governmentrsquos policy unit.ldquoIt does not give us the information needed to put a policy in place with confidence it will not be challenged."},{"url":null,"title":"six-new-electric-vehicle-charging-points-for-east-lothian","story":"The Department for Transportcash will create chargepoints in residential areas in Aberlady, Dunbar, Stenton, North Berwick and West Barns.East Lothian Council applied to the DfTrsquos Office of Low Emission Vehiclesfor the funds following calls from residents who wanted to invest in electric cars.The new funds will be topped-up with money from Transport Scotland.Councillor Norman Hampshire, the councilrsquos cabinet member for the environment, said: ldquoThese chargepoints will improve access for everyone in the area, not just the residents who made the initial approach.ldquoIrsquod encourage anyone with suggestions about locations for new points to get in touch.The cash comes on top of pound, funding from Transport Scotland awarded to the council this year to increase the number of electric vehicle charging points.The six locations for new electric chargepoints are: Haddington Road, Aberlady Church Car Park, Stenton Forth View, West Barns Links Road, North Berwick Dunbar Leisure Centre Car Park and Dunbar High Street Car Park."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-halloween-tale","story":"HIDDEN on the edge of Gford woods are the lonely ruins of Yester Castle. The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is one of more than  local networks set up by UN Global Compact around the world to help translate Sustainable Development Goals into business action and innovation.ldquoThe Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group is focusing on two key challenges, Preston says. ldquoFirstly, how can businesses seize the opportunities of Sustainable Development Goals by building them into their business models and also benefit the Scottish economy, environment and most importantly, our people  ldquoSecondly, how can the Scottish approach to One Planet Prosperity and Sustainable Development Goals create transformational impact across the UK and globally These are big ambitions. So the vision is to translate the global helicopter view of Sustainable Development Goals into practical hands-on tools andapproaches that can be used in the day-to-day work of businesses ndash with benefit for them, their local communities and the environment.There are already great examples in Scotland of Sustainable Development Goals in action. For example, Scottish Water and SEPA have signed a Sustainable Growth Agreement focused on finding new ways to recover more resources from the wastes it manages and generates. It aims to contribute to ten of the Sustainable DevelopmentGoals. On the Isle of Lewis, the Outer Hebrides Local Energy Hub is an innovative partnership project between Comhairle nan Eilean Siar , Community Energy Scotland, Pure Energy Centre and The Scottish Salmon Company demonstrating how dferent renewable energy technologies can be integrated to support local energy economiesand circular supply chains.In the retail industry, brands including Aldi, Asda, Ikea, Boots and Next have signed up to the British Retail Consortiumrsquos Better Retail Better World initiative, which sets out a range of targets in line with Sustainable Development Goals. There are many more examples ndash and the hope is that businesses will share ideas and experiences through the new Scottish SDGs Reporting Working Group.ldquoThe group will run for  months, with the aim of delivering a suite of practical tools and approaches by st April  ndash World Creativity and Innovation Day, Preston explains. ldquoWersquoll do this through themed events and building partnerships, with an initial focus on strategy and reporting to create a consistent approach for everyone.Then wersquoll look at dferent lsquoScotlandrsquos businesses have a critical role to play in leading our contribution to achieving Sustainable Development Goals approaches based on dferent types and sizes of organisations, because a global financial institution might take a dferent approach to a small business or a non-governmental organisation. The last stage will involve pulling together our learnings and experience into a package of tools, simple guidance and case studies for promoting more widely to businesses.SEPArsquos One Planet Prosperity strategy reflects that society is currently using the resources of three planets, and needs to live within its means. ICAS also promotes best practice amongst its members on environmentalsustainability and related corporate social responsibility issues.This includes the importance of building sustainability measures into the reporting of company accounts, to help drive decision-making in this area.ldquoICAS and SEPA could have steered this initiative on their own, but something much bigger and better will be delivered through businesses driving the working group and collaborating to develop shared ideas and action, Preston concludes.Organisations interested in helping to shape the future of sustainable development goal action and reporting, can contact Catherine Preston, SEPArsquoshead of innovation.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the Scottish Government with key organisations and campaign partners.

However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils.In a statement to the Scottish Parliament Mr Swinney said: \"It is important to further evaluate how the assessments are working which is why I have decided to commission an independent review of P assessments to reconsider the evidence.\"While an independent, evidence-based review could conclude that P assessment should be reformed, the review could also recommend a halt to the assessments.\"The Educational Institute of Scotlandunion, which has opposed P testing, said any review of the evidence should have taken place before the introduction of the assessments.Larry Flanagan, the unions general secretary, said: \"EIS members have serious reservations over the educational value of standardised assessments at all stages, but particularly in relation to testing of four and five-year-old children.\"We are disappointed therefore that a delay has been engineered around a decision to end compulsory P assessments.\"Sue Palmer, chair of the Upstart Scotland charity which has campaigned against P testing, added: \"Mr Swinney has passed the responsibility for deciding whether P children should be tested to an independent review.

a Peoplersquos Vote on Brexit, also calculates that a Chequers-style withdrawal would likely cost young people around pound, over the same period while a softer EEA-style Brexit, where the UK would stay in the single market, would likely cost around pound,.The conclusions of Young People and Brexit are endorsed in a foreword to the report by Sir John Major, the former Prime Minister, who wrote: ldquoI would urge every parliamentarian to read and absorb the findings of this report.He pointed out Brexit ldquowas never the choice of the young, who voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU while

were modelled at a worst case of up to pound, in lost earnings for young people by  with the likely cost amounting to some pound, in lost wages.It noted how a hard Brexit would cost young people three times more than university tuition fees and amounts to more than double the deposit first time buyers need to buy a house.OFOC commissioned the research from Thomas Peto, an economic researcher at

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney Youth Café staff and users are delighted to announce that they have successfully secured funding which will keep the Café open for the next three years. £, has been awarded from Children in Need, and will fund staff, activity and running costs.

Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness.

We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Friday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It will also look at whether the tests should continue or “whether they be substantially modied or whether they should be stopped”.Mr Swinney added: “The outcome of the review could be a recommendation to stop the assessments. The review will be led by evidence and what is best for pupils.”Ministers have defended the tests, insisting they provide an important gauge of children’s development in the crucial early years and identy particular areas where they may need help.Ministers have also insisted there should not be “set specic windows” for schools to undertake assessments.Some councils have already looked into the prospect of scrapping the tests, since the vote in parliament and amid concerns among parents.Larry Flanagan of the EIS teaching union said the reservations of the profession over the value of the tests had been spelled out to Mr Swinney.He said the union was disappointed the tests were not being scrapped immediately, but added: “We accept, however, that in establishing an independent review, the Deputy First Minister is open to evidence about the efficacy of the SNSAs [Scottish National Standardised Assessments], although we would make the point that perhaps a review of the evidence before the introduction of the tests would have been more appropriate.”The move prompted an angry reaction from opposition parties after they united to out-vote the minority SNP government at Holyrood last month and backed a motion calling for the tests to be axed.• Read more: Quiz: Could you pass Scotland’s P test Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: “This whole statement was a justication for refusing to respect the motion and defying this Parliament. The cabinet secretary demands that we focus on education needs – that’s exactly what we did in reaching the conclusion that we did a month ago. Parliament listened to teachers, parents and the education arguments and voted accordingly.”Conservative MSP Liz Smith hit back at Mr Swinney’s claims that opposition parties were guilty of political opportunism in their opposition to the testing regime. She questioned whether “Primary  teachers and those members of the public and parents opposing these tests are also a disgrace and guilty of political opportunism”.The review was branded a “missed opportunity” by Greens education spokesman Ross Greer. He said: “They could have proven that they’re listening to teachers, parents, experts and parliament. They could have called a halt to these tests of four- and five-year-olds, but instead, the tests will continue.”Liberal Democrat education spokesman Tavish Scott said: “ days ago John Swinney published what he said was an evidence-based review and it was a whitewash. Now he wants another review.“Teachers say national testing of five-year-old boys and girls add nothing to their knowledge of the child’s progress.

In an attack on Jeremy Corbyn’s lukewarm support for a fresh referendum on EU membership, the group added that “this is being waved through by the Labour frontbench, but no majority exists in Parliament for the current Brexit trajectory.”The SNP’s Westminster leader has signalled a strengthening of the party’s support for another Brexit referendum in recent days, saying he is prepared to push the issue forward in the CommonsMPs reject the Prime Minister’s deal with Brussels.Following yesterday’s meeting, Mr Blackford said: “The UK government’s reckless approach to negotiations threatens livelihoods and ignores the clear wishes of the people of Scotland.“Scotland voted to remain in the EU and we continue to press the UK Government to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union so we can protect jobs and living standards”Mr Cable said he told Mr Barnier it was “time to start serious contingency planning for a People’s Vote... because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”Mr Barnier was also asked to provide guarantees to UK citizens living in the EU that their rights would be status would be protected even in a no-deal Brexit. “It is simply the right thing to do,” Mr Cable said.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said yesterday that while Labour were open to a second EU referendum, its preference was for a general election because “we are trying to bring the whole country together”. “The country is still ided right down the middle,” he added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4819721.1540468577!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp steps up people s vote bid as mps see barnier","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader has said the Nationalists will lead the bid for a second EU referendumparliament rejects Theresa May#s Brexit deal.The SNP’s Westminster leader has said the Nationalists will lead the bid for a second EU referendumparliament rejects Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Ian Blackford said the SNP would put forward a motion on a so-called People’s Votestaying in the single market and customs union is closed off or the UK heads for a no-deal Brexit.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory.

Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area.

Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

Mr Waggott was arrested in  following a search of his property. PSNI seized £, in cash, a mobile phone and a ledger detailing the sale of almost £, worth of contraband goods including cigarettes, fireworks and clothing.The Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Revenue  Customs and the National Crime Agency have established the PCTF to tackle criminality linked to paramilitary activity as part of the Executives action plan on Tackling Paramilitary Activity, Criminality, and Organised Crime.Detective Inspector Lynne Knox from the PCTF said: “The conviction and sentencing of Mr Waggot highlights the strength of the PCTF in bringing together PSNI, HMRC and the National Crime Agency and the impact that we can have in tackling organised crime and those that gain from it.“Cheap counterfeit goods or cigarettes may seem like a bargain but there is no such thing as a victimless crime. Evidence shows that money made from the sale of counterfeit goods is used to fund other forms of crime. Also, by purchasing illegal goods, revenue to the legitimate economy is lost putting jobs at risk and resulting in less money available for public services like health and education. Communities end up paying the price whilst paramilitaries profit. “I would appeal for anyone with information regarding criminality by paramilitary organisations to contact police on .

The DUP are isolationists and on the wrong side of the argument and the democratic will of the people.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ann Travers, whose sister Mary was murdered by the IRA in  She also voiced serious concerns over revelations about a Sinn Fein minister reporting to unelected figures within the republican movement, claiming: “The IRA hasn’t gone away. They are up at Stormont making the decisions.”Ms Travers, who along with TUV leader Jim Allister championed the introduction of the Civil Service Special AdvisersBill in , was reacting to statements made during Tuesday’s inquiry hearing by former Finance Minister Mairtin O Muilleoir, during which he confirmed that Sinn Fein had effectively ignored the law on employing Spads.Although the legislation was introduced five years ago, Mr O Muilleoir told the inquiry that Sinn Fein put in place a structure to allow one-time senior IRA member Aidan McAteer – then Spad to Martin McGuinness – to continue in his role, because they disagreed with the law.The Civil Service Spad Bill, which became known as Ann’s Law, was designed to prevent ex-prisoners who were jailed for five years or more from becoming highly paid political advisers. It was brought forward after former IRA prisoner Mary McArdle – who was involved in the slaying of Mary Travers – was appointed as adviser to Sinn Fein Culture Minister Caral Ni Chuilin in .Reacting to Mr O Muilleoir’s comments, Ms Travers pointed out that while Sinn Fein may be employing advisers with serious criminal records, they are being paid out of party funds rather than the public purse.But condemning their circumnavigation of the law, she said: “I think it is quite abhorrent that they ignore and still don’t get the hurt that was caused that actually caused this Bill to come into being. They haven’t learnt anything from it.”Branding Sinn Fein’s actions as “anti-peace process”, she continued: “It shows that whenever the law suits Sinn Fein they will use it, butthey don’t like it then they ignore it.“We just had a consultation about dealing with the past and legacy issues, and here heis sitting saying Sinn Fein just didn’t agree with a piece of legislation that was brought forward with a victim and with plenty of victims supporting it. All that was being asked of Sinn Fein was to acknowledge the families’ hurt and help them, yet they couldn’t even do that.”With the RHI Inquiry having uncovered details about how Mr O Muilleoir reported to a series of unelected republican figures – one of whom, Padraic Wilson is reportedly one of the most senior members of the IRA – Ms Travers questionedSinn Fein is just “a face” for “shady characters lurking in the shadows.”“It just seems they are just there as a face and they just do what they are told to do and say. People need to be aware that whenever they are voting for their local Sinn Fein candidate, actually in reality are they really able to do anything  Is it really them that you’re voting for or are you voting for these shady characters in the background, still lurking in the shadows, still telling themwhat they can and can’t do, what laws they should follow, which ones they should ignore  I just find it completely depressing.“We have just had the anniversary of the Shankill bomb. We are having other anniversaries this week of other people who were murdered in retaliation, including Greysteel, so you would think at this stage we should be able to trust our politicians, but actually it looks, certainly for this particular political party , that we can’t trust them at all because we don’t know who we are talking to.”DUP and SF asked man involved in RHI to find ‘independent’ investigator Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Stressing that trust and trusting people are major issues for victims and survivors, she continued: “Here we are in ,  years on from the Good Friday Agreement. I would have thought by this stage in politics and as a society we should be maturing and working towards a true reconciliation where we actually know that when we sit and talk to somebody that the person we are dealing with is the person who is in front of us and not this unelected person in the background.“Any victims I have spoken with during the whole legacy consultation were all very dubious about how it would really and truly deal with the past in a fair way and it is quite obvious that it won’t. If Sinn Fein can’t even respect a law that was made five years ago how on earth are we to trust them with the legacy issue ”Mr Allister was unavailable for comment, but a TUV spokesperson said Sinn Fein’s actions had “come as no surprise”.Accusing others at Stormont of facilitating Sinn Fein’s attempts to get round the law, the spokesman said: “It is clear that the law on special advisers was flouted left, right and centre.“All of this does nothing to increase confidence in politics.

Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling.Photo by Matt Mackey The evidence raises questions about how serious the DUP and Sinn Fein were at that point about really getting to the truth of the RHI scandal, a process which has ultimately led to damaging revelations about both parties.At the time when the RHI scandal became a crisis for Stormont, Mr Sterling was permanent secretary in the Department of Finance.Recalling that time he said that the Audit Office report which first publicly exposed the RHI scandal in July  “gave rise to relatively low media comment” and it was not until after the BBC Spotlight programme on December  that the issue became a crisis – and particularly “the subsequent focus by the BBC Nolan radio programme” which “gave rise to major concern within the Executive about the damage the fall-out from RHI was doing to the reputation of the Executive”.However, despite the public outcry and the revelation that a whistle-blower had personally approached Arlene Foster, the minister who established the scheme, Mr Sterling said that there was still “meaningful and constructive cooperation between Spads after the Spotlight programme and broad agreement that the Executive would need to try to regain some control of events”.He said: “During the week beginning December   consideration was being given to conducting a short, focused investigation by someone with expertise and independence, but short of a full public inquiry. “I was involved in a conference phone call with the head of the civil serviceon the morning of Thursday December  at which such an idea was being pursued. My recollection is that Hugh Widdis, [senior Sinn Fein aide] Aidan McAteer and [top DUP Spad] Timothy Johnston were with HOCS at the time. “I was tasked with trying to find a suitable independent person ideally with expertise on the energy sector.”Mr Sterling had been the top official in Mrs Foster’s department when RHI was set up and during its first few years, before moving to the finance department where he was again involved in closing RHI. For that reason, he is an important witness and when the public inquiry was later being established by his department Mr Sterling recused himself from that process.Mr Sterling said that it was Jonathan Bell’s remarkable televised interview with Stephen Nolan, followed by an interview with Mrs Foster, which “changed the dynamic” and by the following day “it became clear ... that Sinn Fein were fundamentally reappraising their approach”.Mr Sterling also spoke at someabout how the revelations of the inquiry have undermined public confidence in the civil service.He said: “The extent of the failings uncovered by the RHI Inquiry so far has, quite understandably, given rise to questions about the competence and capacity of the NI Civil Service to develop and deliver complex policy.”Ann Travers: IRA, not Sinn Fein, is at Stormont making decisionsRyan Macrae murder: People of Portaferry stunned at death Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he said it would be “unjust to infer from the RHI scheme that all government policy-making, the administration of public funds and the delivery of public services in Northern Ireland is beset by the kinds of problems and issues that have arisen in the case of RHI”.He said he believed there was “a strong case for a review” of how Spads operate before anyto devolution.try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner.

It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
