It\u0027s going to get a lot worse, very quickly.This morning, Trump went on an angry defensive self-congratulatory tweet-storm, boasting about how well he is handling the crisis, and attacking \u0027fake news media and their partner the Democrat Party\u0027 for \u0027doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the Coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant.\u0027                  President Trump argued the stock market collapse was due to Russia and Saudi Arabia arguing over the price of oil and also blamed the \u0027Fake News\u0027           President Trump also tried to downplay the wave of coronavirus infections and deaths He then quoted Surgeon General as saying, \u0027The risk is low to the average American.\u0027That last claim is probably true.For most people under 50, in good health, it appears to be a relatively low risk virus.But the risk for elderly and infirm people is extremely high, and the speed of infection of COD-19 - way faster than normal flu - and deadly severity of its impact on people in those group- far worse than normal flu - are genuinely scary.In Italy alone, it has now infected almost as many people as SARS infected worldwide in its entirety, infections are rocketing higher every day, and the mortality rate is running at nearly 5 percent.If the same thing happens in the U.S. then hundreds of thousands of Americans will die.This eventuality would make Trump\u0027s \u0027there\u0027s nothing to worry about\u0027 rebound savagely and perhaps unforgivably in his political face.       Coronavirus patients lie face-down on their hospital beds as they are treated by medical staff in protective suits in Cremona, northern Italy, today. Research has suggested that lying face-down may improve survival chances in intensive care (Ironically, Italy was the first European country to ban flights from China – which is what Trump boasts of doing in America to great effect – and yet it\u0027s suffered the worst outbreak in Europe.)It doesn\u0027t take even a stable genius to work out why Trump is maintaining this \u0027nothing to see here\u0027 stance.If coronavirus runs riot through America, and the economy, his biggest success story, continues to implode, then the President knows he could face the vengeful wrath of voters at the ballot box.Even his die-hard base may drop their unwavering support if their relatives start dying and their business go bust.So, the stakes are potentially very high for President Trump.That\u0027s why he was even reluctant to let Americans off a cruise ship in San Francisco into quarantine, despite the risk to their health aboard a vessel with 21 confirmed cases of the virus - because he said he didn\u0027t want the number of reported US infections to rise.Seriously, Mr President?These people are not just \u0027numbers\u0027 – they\u0027re American citizens who have an absolute right to be back on U.S. soil.       Welch died last week, and his long-time friend Donald Trump paid fulsome tribute to him: \u0027There was no corporate leader like \u0027Neutron Jack\u0027, he tweeted. \u0027He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.\u0027 Trump (L) greets former General Electric CEO Jack Welch at the beginning of a policy forum in the State Dining Room at the White House February 3, 2017 in Washington, DC To be perfectly frank, I don\u0027t care right now about what coronavirus means for Trump politically.I care about coronavirus means for public health.And the President\u0027s normal swaggering, loose-tongued, fact-challenged, wise-cracking style of leadership just doesn\u0027t work on something as serious as this.On Friday, during his weird and woeful press conference, he boasted about having a \u0027supergenius\u0027 scientist uncle at MIT, and then said: \u0027I like this stuff, I really get it, people are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, \u0027How do you know so much about this?\u0027 Maybe I have a natural ability?\u0027No offence, Mr President, but everything you\u0027re been saying about COD-19 to date suggests you have absolutely no idea what the hell you\u0027re dealing with.As your friend Jack Welch said, face reality as it is, not what you want it to be.I strongly suggest you stop your absurdly premature victory tour, leave the expert talk to the experts and start taking coronavirus a lot more seriously, before it\u0027s too late - for Americans, and for your presidency. "},{"url":null,"title":"Piers Morgan blasts Meghan Markle got wants","story":"Think pink like Susanna in a dress by Heidi HigginsBuy it hereThanks to stylist Debbie Harper, Susanna Reid is always dressed to impress for Good Morning Britain.Today, the presenter looked spring-ready in a beautiful pink dress by Heidi Higgins.

Because instead of his projected 18 months, Graham\u0027s build dragged on for more than ten years — much of which he and Mandie, an NHS worker, spent living in an old holiday caravan in the garden with her two sons from a previous relationship and, from 2012, baby Eva, too.Blimey. All those years in a caravan in the garden, with two teenage boys and a baby? I am astonished Mandie is still here, let alone beaming so proudly, telling me how great he is and how very proud of him she is.\u0027It was surprisingly comfortable,\u0027 says Graham. \u0027We had heating and TV and an oven and everything.\u0027The saga started back in 2008 when, after snapping up a very dated bungalow in Ringwood, Hants, for about £240,000, a builder friend — \u0027a lovely bloke, I trust him\u0027 — persuaded Graham to knock it down and start again.         Now after spending a further £140,000, the house, pictured, is worth around £500,000         Graham studied DIY manuals and watched instructional videos on YouTube to complete the job         The job took a decade because Graham was completing the work on his own, while running his own IT business  \u0027He had a quick look round and said, \u0027You can do this, mate. It\u0027s not rocket science. Give it a go. If you get stuck, give me a shout.\u0027 \u0027Luckily, Mandie trusted Graham implicitly. Not just with their life savings, but also their home and the next decade of her life.Even so, the sight that confronted them the day after the bungalow was demolished (by local contractors for just £2,000) came as a bit of a shock. \u0027Suddenly, it seemed like a very big plot with no house on it,\u0027 he says. Mandie realised immediately that he would not keep to the timescale.\u0027The first year was mostly spent digging up the garden — just getting the pipes down took months,\u0027 she says. \u0027But it didn\u0027t feel helpful to say anything.\u0027Because while Graham worked whenever the light would allow, seven days a week (\u0027though very quietly, of course, at the weekends\u0027), he was also trying to run his IT business. \u0027So I\u0027d get up in the morning, mix up a load of cement, get my bricks ready and start,\u0027 he says. \u0027But when I\u0027d done ten or so bricks, my mobile would ring and I\u0027d have to jump in the shower and go on an IT job.\u0027And so things progressed — stop start, stop start — at snail\u0027s pace.Of course, most people don\u0027t literally build their own house. They bring in an architect, a project manager and a team of builders, electricians, plumbers and plasterers who work on it together.Not Graham. They had no spare money, so he did everything — and not just the work, but the planning, the ordering, the measuring, the negotiating, the heavy lifting and the worrying in the dead of night. Which was exactly how he liked it. There was a brief spell when Mandie\u0027s dad helped out — but not for long. \u0027He got the cement ratio wrong once, so he was out,\u0027 says Graham, firmly. Once, Gary from next door helped him swing the roof rafters in. Other neighbours lent him tools, advice and moral support. (\u0027Apart from one neighbour, they\u0027ve all been brilliant,\u0027 says Mandie.)         Finally though, after some prodding, he admits that he\u0027d love to do another renovation, if the opportunity aroseGraham has always been good with his hands and was never one to shy away from a challenge. Aged 13, when his parents refused to give him pocket money, he got a job in a local car body shop.When he was 18, he set up his own company, which he ran until he was 30. But he wanted more from life, so he taught himself about computers at home and duly set up an IT company. (It was while fixing the computer of a friend of Mandie\u0027s that the pair met.)\u0027I am very logical, I like following instructions,\u0027 he admits. So, he says, in an odd way building a house from YouTube videos and DIY books suited him perfectly.But even he couldn\u0027t have predicted the toll the build would take on his body — his bones, his joints, his brain, everything. \u0027When I started, I was in great shape but, somehow, the harder I worked, the more weight I put on. I never had time to go to the gym any more.\u0027Naturally, there were moments when it was all too much.When, for instance, Graham became tearful and overwhelmed. And when, before meeting his mates for a pint, he\u0027d ask them not to mention the house or to take the mick. (This had the effect of making them do it more.)The real pressure, he says, came from wanting to provide for Mandie. \u0027She was incredibly supportive, but I knew what I was putting her through, and I couldn\u0027t go any faster.\u0027 It didn\u0027t help when, all around them, neighbours\u0027 extensions rocketed up. \u0027They\u0027d say, \u0027I hope it won\u0027t inconvenience you\u0027 and the whole thing would be done in three months and we\u0027d go over and admire them and I\u0027d be like, \u0027Oh Mandie, I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027 \u0027She, meanwhile, had her own challenges — managing with two teenage boys in a small caravan, producing Christmas dinners from the tiny oven, dashing out in the rain to get peas from the freezer in the garage.\u0027I am very organised,\u0027 she says stoically. She\u0027d have to be. Two years into the build, Eva was born and, suddenly, there were four of them in the caravan.\u0027In many ways she made things better,\u0027 says Mandie.Then, in 2015, when Eva was three and the stairs were about to go in, Mandie was in hospital with back surgery — having two vertebrae fused — and came home to a building site to recuperate.So did she ever really blow — ever shout and scream and hurl pots and pans about?\u0027There were days,\u0027 she says. \u0027There definitely were days . . .\u0027When she wished it had never started, when she \u0027vented\u0027 to friends over a glass of wine about how long it was taking, about what a perfectionist he was.\u0027But I always knew that he had to finish it, otherwise he\u0027d just feel like he\u0027d completely failed. What was the point in getting halfway?\u0027 So to Graham, she\u0027d simply say: \u0027You\u0027re amazing, just keep going.\u0027He did his best, but there were endless delays — from rain, flu, long, cold winters and him wanting to get it right.Then, in 2015, he was offered a job he couldn\u0027t say no to as head of procurement for a care-home company and stopped work on the house for two years. A lesser woman would have walked out but, somehow, Mandie held it together — finding the silver lining at every setback and delay.Her faith was finally rewarded last April when they got sign-off on their five-bedroom home, complete with three bathrooms, a gym and a TV room in the garden, as well as a utility room-cum-garage.It might not be to everyone\u0027s taste, but Graham\u0027s attention to detail means the finish is exceptional — so good that officials asked him to enter it into the local authority building competition. \u0027That felt pretty good,\u0027 he beams.It has clean, perfect lines, empty surfaces, a mint-green bedroom suite and a gorgeous, girly bedroom for Eva, now eight. There is also a floating kitchen counter, slate-grey kitchen units, a computerised sound system and a vast downstairs wet room. Amazingly, Graham has no regrets. Not even the time it took. \u0027I can honestly say, there is nothing I would have done differently,\u0027 he says.The build cost about £140,000 and has produced a house worth nearly half a million, though they are reluctant to talk figures. They both insist it is their home for life.But I am not so sure about that. Because while Graham always vowed he would never do another build and deliberately sold or gave away all his building machinery to remove the temptation, he is already twitching.\u0027I love sitting on the sofa and looking up at my crisp lines,\u0027 he says. \u0027But I miss having something to do. It\u0027s like being on a treadmill, you can\u0027t just stop suddenly.\u0027So he has taken the engines out of both of their cars and replaced them.He\u0027s about to strip down an old bike and add new parts, and tells me how, every now and then, he gets on his hands and knees to buff his already immaculate grouting with a toothbrush.Finally though, after some prodding, he admits that he\u0027d love to do another renovation, if the opportunity arose.And somehow, after years of camping out in a caravan with three children in the garden, Mandie does not go bananas. She smiles proudly, and quickly clarifies: \u0027But not while we\u0027re living in it, next time . . . please.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Health minister Nadine Dorries diagnosed coronavirus","story":"Share this article \u0027I understand why people are worried about this disease.

Instead of Lake Como, they\u0027ve got a rocky beach, with grey skies overhead. Instead of Venice Beach, Los Angeles, there\u0027s the local steak house. It\u0027s not as if they\u0027ve escaped the paparazzi - walking in a local park with Archie, Meghan was furious to discover a photographer snapping away with a long lens, hidden under a tree. Canada might have stricter privacy laws, but this couple will always be the subject of media attention, and to think otherwise is naïve.Perversely, Harry and Meghan have turned their back on celebrity hangouts (which come with well organised security) where pals like Serena Williams live - California or Florida, for example - and rented a mansion on the waterfront of South Vancouver Island built in a bland international style.

Few would assume that the person behind the lens is the protagonists’ mum.In Nicolas \u0026amp Adrien: A World With Two Sons, which binds together two interconnected bodies of work – Teen Tribe (2005-10) and The Twenties (2010-18) – Fougeron beautifully captures her sons and their assorted friends and lovers as they incrementally journey from innocence to experience at their family home in the Bronx, New York, and during holidays in the south of France.With inidual picture titles ranging from Don’t Bogart That Joint, My Friend to Dress to Get Laid Party: Adrien Getting Ready, Fougeron is without question a cool mum. Still, she long hesitated before embarking on her project.In the early 00s, the single mother resigned from her post as a creative director in the perfume industry. “I came home late on 911 and Adrien told me, ‘You were the only parent not at school today.’ It hit me then that I was travelling so much and estranged from my sons.”Shortly after, Fougeron began taking reportage portraits of them and what she describes as their highly conscious, “911-Facebook-Occupy-Wall-Street generation” as a way to reconnect. She also sought to produce an alternative to the dominant depiction of adolescents as invariably angst-ridden.Initially, Nicolas wasn’t too thrilled. “Especially in your teens, you don’t want to share everything with your mother,” he tells me, sitting with his mum and brother in his gran’s living room. “And this entailed that I would share a lot more than a regular teen would.”He overcame that initial reluctance upon observing his mother’s elaborate mise-en-scène: shooting with a large-format camera in a painterly fashion, inspired by Vermeer’s domestic interiors, worlds away from a snapshot, documentary aesthetic. Seeing the images framed as art pieces, and being given a right of veto over anything they didn’t like, also helped both sons embrace their mother’s project as something more than a mere diary of their lives. “It was a tremendous privilege and gift, even though at times it felt more like a burden,” acknowledges Nicolas.Now a film-maker and multidisciplinary artist respectively, Nicolas and Adrien recognise how this close-knit collaboration played a foundational role in their creative pursuits. “I feel like we really started photographing together,” Adrien says, flipping through the book. “You helped me a lot with lighting,” Martine says. “Sometimes, you also had lots to say about my framing.”Fougeron’s work is indebted to Pictures from Home, Larry Sultan’s stunning meditation on his parents ageing in Reagan-era America, which cultivates a similar ambiguity between the staged and the spontaneous. But the most striking point of comparison has to be Richard Linklater’s Boyhood, a painstaking cinematic journey that took 12 years to film and which charts the young Mason’s development from inquisitive child to sharp-eyed, sensitive young man.Like the Texan film-maker, Fougeron deftly avoids the trap of dramatic coming-of-age cliches, opting instead to highlight “in-between” events in her sons’ lives: gentler, more introspective moments, the emotional impact of which grows when viewed cumulatively. Take, for instance, Adrien holding up a phallically defaced copy of The Catcher in the Rye on the subway, or Nicolas camping out at New York’s Zuccotti Park during Occupy Wall Street. The power of Linklater and Fougeron’s far-reaching visual bildungsromans resides in their sense of uncertainty: these boys are in the process of becoming their future selves, but everything remains possible as they move through the volatile landscape of adolescence.Mother and sons acknowledge the comparisons to Boyhood, with Nicolas adding that while Fougeron “loves a good gossip, she also wasn’t out to capture the drama in our lives”. Was she after heightened impressions of adolescence, then? “I wanted to restage what I had experienced strongly, which I also saw in them,” she explains, adding to her sons: “You guys made me discover new things, but I also recognised things I myself had lived through intensely. And when I saw those, I thought: these are photos I must take.”Adrien alludes to the book’s “underlying sexual component,” an interesting element to consider in light of other family-themed projects by female photographers like Sally Mann or Tierney Gearon who have been criticised for depicting their children naked. Fougeron consciously avoided that perilous route. “Certainly I could have taken those types of images but I thought that would be trespassing on my sons and their friends,” she says. “To me, the overarching impression is more sweet and intimate, which is a reflection of my sons’ loving relationships with their girlfriends.”“But that’s also what makes your work interesting,” adds Adrien. “There is sexuality in Larry Clark and Sally Mann’s photographs, but I think if you can express sexuality without nudity, that’s really powerful.”Fougeron intends to carry on with the project well into her sons’ adult lives, albeit less intensely. “The 30s are more spaced out than the teens, so not every week,” she notes. Nicolas, who has permanently relocated to Paris, shoots me a conspiratorial look that suggests his mother’s access to her models may still need to be ironed out. “I’m just as surprised as you are.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60dd612657841153ebff3cc8a64cfb5233ccb5d1/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2697d18382442a2814124f59b932dcf0","title":"rock classics the most extraordinary stone buildings on earth in pictures","story":"An aqueduct without mortar, a tilting library, a house sandwiched between two boulders … Stone, a new book by William Hall, celebrates some of the world’s finest buildings, built with one of its oldest and most durable materials"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed07c784dff558fdd03797c45d249732ee500234/0_93_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53901404d526fc79ab3d6cccd53013d9","title":"the mirror and the light shines with huge first week sales","story":"Hilary Mantel’s conclusion to her Thomas Cromwell trilogy sold more than 95,000 copies in three daysHilary Mantel’s much-anticipated The Mirror and the Light has been selling a copy every 2.7 seconds since its release last Thursday, with the final book in the two-time Booker winner’s trilogy selling more than 95,000 print copies in just three days.According to figures from sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, 5p in every £1 spent on books in the UK last week went towards a copy of The Mirror and the Light. After an eight-year wait since the last book, 2012’s Bring Up the Bodies, excited fans lined up to buy the novel at bookshops around the UK at midnight on Wednesday.The new novel follows 2009’s Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies to complete Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell trilogy. Widely praised by critics, a good number of whom predicted that it will win Mantel her third Booker prize, the 900-page novel follows Cromwell’s final ascent to unprecedented riches and honour in the service of King Henry VIII, before his abrupt fall from royal favour and public execution at Tower Hill in 1540.The fortunes of Mantel’s trilogy have been nowhere near as turbulent. Bolstered by two Booker prize wins, a West End play and a BBC miniseries Wolf Hall made Mantel the first Booker winner to win the UK overall No 1 spot. The first two books have sold more than 1.5m copies around the world.The Mirror and the Light is also on track to overtake sales of Margaret Atwood’s sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, The Testaments, which sold 103,177 copies in its first five days.

The talks had been expected to agree production cuts, to maintain prices at a time when the global economy is under increasing pressure.The price of Brent crude rose $2.80 to $37.16 a barrel by lunchtime after investors were reassured by the Russian intervention and other moves by Japan and the US. Tokyo announced a second $4bn economic stimulus package, while Donald Trump said he would push for tax cuts to tackle the economic spillovers of the coronavirus.The Russian oil minister, Alexander Novak, said he did not rule out joint measures with Opec to stabilise the market, adding that the next meeting to discuss production levels and prices was planned for May-June.However, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister told Reuters he did not see a need to hold a meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on what measures should be taken to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and prices.“I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.Analysts at RBC said: “Price wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers.”They said without a deal between Russia and the Opec countries it was difficult to see where the oil price would settle.The last time the price of Brent crude dropped below $40 a barrel in 2016, the US shale oil boom was in full flow and global oil markets were flooded with supply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2e72f3b0beebc2ae39894b1f5aff717074b9dc9/0_143_3550_2130/master/3550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3a95d327c895b4c0aa7a381706ba8c","title":"brits comparing us uk politics different democratic","story":"There’s nothing like a US presidential election cycle to prompt British pundits to think about Anglo-America as a “thing”. The UK is the 51st state in all but name, right? In reality, the similarities are more complex, and the differences are stark.You can understand where the idea comes from. On both sides of the Atlantic 40 years of Reaganite and Thatcherite policies of financial deregulation, union emasculation, and a sanguine attitude to de-industrialisation, have sculpted Anglo-American society in similar ways: declining life expectancy among those whose communities destroyed as a consequence of these policies and a surviving population that blames immigrants for their problems.The political response to these economic and social conditions has been the election of two unsuitable philanderers, Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. Both were initially resisted by party elites, who then abjectly surrendered. All dissenters have been purged. Their advisers are bizarre, comic book villain-types such as Stephen Miller and Dominic Cummings.However, the differences between Labour and the Democrats remain profound. The sudden revival of Joe Biden’s fortunes is proof. Both parties are lazily described as being of the “left” but really, America hasn’t had a “left” in the British sense as long as I’ve been alive, which is a very long time.The Labour party was from its inception a socialist party, and even though clause IV was taken out of the party’s constitution the ideology of public ownership runs strong in the membership and recent leadership of the party. The “left” wing of the US Democratic party embraces the legacy of Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal – but while his opponents in the 1930s called it “socialism”, it wasn’t. Actual socialism never found a foothold in the US – perhaps because it was commonly called “godless socialism”, especially in the south. America is a damned religious country. And Americans have traditionally had no problem with billionaires – perhaps because many of them fervently believe in the American myth that anyone can get rich if they work hard enough. The tragedy of Bernie Sanders is that he is a New Deal Democrat but insists on calling himself a socialist. You don’t win in America using that language. The sudden revival of Biden’s fortunes is proof.Then there’s the governmental structures these political forces operate within. In Britain, the executive is housed in the legislature. Johnson leads a well-whipped majority and a prime minister with a majority of this size is in charge of an “elective dictatorship”. In the US, the executive branch of government is separate from the legislature. This check on presidential power is profound, especially when, as is the case now, one of the branches of Congress is in the control of the opposition party.Barack Obama found that out when he tried to appoint Merrick Garland to the supreme court and the Republican-controlled Senate, which has the constitutional role of approving high court judges, would not give Garland the courtesy of a hearing. Trump found the limits to his power when the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and tied him up in impeachment.The Senate, unlike the House of Lords, is not appointed. It is elected. Senators need to pander to voters successfully, unlike for example, Zac Goldsmith, who was elevated to the Lords – and returned to the cabinet – after losing his seat in the last election.Then there is money. In the US there is tons of it surrounding elections. Unimaginable sums, really: $6.5bn was spent on the 2016 presidential election across all races, with most of that money going on broadcast media advertising. There has always been money in American politics, but in the past decade it has grown to narco-trafficker levels of cash.In 2010, the supreme court decided – in the case titled Citizens United v Federal Election Commission – that corporations had first amendment rights – free speech rights, like iniduals – and putting restrictions on corporations giving money to air political advertisements in broadcast media was an infringement of that right. Since then the cash has flowed in and Americans are bombarded with paid political propaganda non stop.In the UK there is no first amendment and there are firm restrictions on political advertising on television and radio. Party political broadcasts are strictly rationed and election campaigns take place within tightly defined windows. But there is a “free” press. Conservative politicians don’t need to raise money for advertising, they get it for free. Every day, outside every newsagent, there is a rack of blaring headlines trumpeting Conservative policies or viewpoints. They’re not far off the billboards that line US highways. Decades of exposure to them, and it’s no wonder that Brexit won.Clearly, when it comes to propaganda channels, both countries have them, which brings me back to where I started: Anglo-America. Maybe some day Anglo-America will be a reality – after Brexit negotiations collapse, and the UK disintegrates, and England applies to become the 51st state. Then American politics and English politics will be the same. But that will not happen this electoral cycle or the next. The US is still a very, very different country.• Michael Goldfarb is the host of the podcast FRDH, First Rough Draft of History"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ba011e3c7e9c833789879453f4d8d8d58d6c01/576_248_4479_2688/master/4479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aba9c1e9deeb10365f6bfe57d830020","title":"resilient levelled up uk budget green zero carbon industry","story":"Transitioning to zero-carbon industry must be used to address the geographical imbalance of our economy at the same timeThis week’s budget will be the first passed by parliament since MPs declared a climate emergency, but it could be the last before the UK hosts the Cop26 climate talks later this year.Many people have drawn legitimate comparisons between the respective responses to coronavirus and the climate crisis – both big shocks to the economy. But it’s important not to lose sight of why the response to Covid-19 has been so rushed and dramatic – we were caught by surprise. We have not, however, been taken by surprise by the climate crisis.If we let things get to that point with our climate – whether through increased water scarcity, coastal flooding or wildfires – the consequences will not only be severe and tragic, but unlike an epidemic they will also be long-lasting.And so this week’s budget can’t afford to miss the bigger picture it must be a climate budget. Measures to contain or delay the spread of disease will be a necessity. But that won’t be an excuse to detract from efforts to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency in a way that serves society.The problems facing the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are clear. To reach net zero, annual household emissions of carbon will need to fall from about 8,000kg of C02 today to not much more than 1,000kg by 2050. The largest reductions will need to be in heating, transport and electricity. But while good progress has been made to reduce emissions from the UK’s power sector, we are far behind in almost every other part of the economy. According to the Committee on Climate Change, the UK remains behind schedule in all but seven of its 24 indicators to reach even our previous legally binding emissions targets, before these were increased to “net zero by 2050”.More importantly, we know private investment alone won’t cut it. This is partly because many of the risks in developing new technology are too high without significant government support. But we also know creating greener jobs in the right places is unlikely to succeed if we rely on markets alone. The UK remains one of the most regionally unequal countries in Europe, with GDP per head about three times higher in Milton Keynes compared with the Wirral. Transitioning to zero-carbon industry must be used to address the geographical imbalance of our economy at the same time.For the chancellor then, this is a no-brainer yes, invest in the regions you want to level up, but make that investment green and you’ll be putting those places – and the country – on track for a more resilient and fairer economy as well.Alongside investment, we also need to raise money to pay for higher day-to-day spending, such as for new skills training and a stronger social safety net for the most affected regions. At the same time, an ageing population and reduced inward migration are likely to shrink tax – and increase the costs of older age care – over exactly the same period.So the chancellor will likely be considering some higher taxes, and wherever possible these will need to be green too. Things like replacing air passenger duty with a frequent flyer levy will help, as will replacing fuel duty with a more progressive alternative. Cuts to national insurance – costing billions, disproportionately benefiting higher income households and doing nothing to reshape consumption – will not.Get this right now, and the chancellor will not only help address existential threat, but he could give us the chance of becoming a healthier and fairer society for a generation. Get this wrong, and history will judge cruelly. Being resigned to last-minute damage limitation is an inevitability with an epidemic, but with the climate crisis it is ours to choose.• Alfie Stirling is head of economics at the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9bf265938a6ee4bcfc95d5c6c5502491a129b2/157_113_3343_2007/master/3343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c91d807e0b7f1fe148735a191ff197f4","title":"saudi rul prince mohammed bin salman struck first crackdown","story":"All is not well in the House of Saud. On 7 March, Mohammed bin Salman, the young crown prince and future king of Saudi Arabia, boldly dispatched his masked security personnel to bring two of Saudi’s most senior princes, Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz and Muhammad bin Nayef, to the palace after a hunting trip in the desert. It’s still unclear whether they have been detained for short-term interrogations or to be imprisoned. What’s certain is that Prince Mohammed’s decision was a preemptive strike to intimidate those who have dared question his leadership style from inside the royal household. Although Mohammed is the crown prince, he plays the role of king. He remains in control of all economic, political, social and foreign relations, and eclipses his father, King Salman, as unofficial ruler of Saudi Arabia.The arrests were ordered after the royal court was passed details of an alleged plot to undermine Prince Mohammed’s ascendance to the throne. Among the two princes he arrested, Ahmed is the most eligible to become king – he is the only remaining brother of the incumbent King Salman and would have been first in line had his brother not promoted his own heir, much to Ahmed’s chagrin.Still, a fully-fledged palace coup is unlikely: Prince Mohammed controls the security, intelligence and military capabilities of the kingdom. No other prince can mobilise enough troops to march on the palace and depose a man with the coercive powers of the state at his disposal. It’s more likely that the detained princes were planning on withdrawing their support should Mohammed become king. In order to ascend to the throne, he will seek the bay’ah, the oath of allegiance given by the most senior princes represented in the 33-member committee of allegiance that was established by King Abdullah in 2008.Both Ahmed bin Abzul Aziz and Muhammad bin Nayef are members of this committee, and Prince Mohammed likely knows they won’t rush to offer their support. Though the young prince doesn’t technically need the bay’ah’s seal of approval to become king, he will be isolated without it – and his rule will lack the legitimacy essential for a smooth succession.Further arrests will offer no protection against this leadership crisis. Prince Mohammed finds himself at the centre of a struggle that began with his predecessors. Successive kings have ruled Saudi Arabia as their own private fiefdom, denying Saudi citizens the right to any role in the country’s domestic and foreign affairs. The Saudi royal family has pushed back against demands to transform the absolute monarchy into a constitutional one, with an elected national assembly and government that could deal with power vacuums and leadership struggles within the royal household.Had Saudi kings accepted a constitutional transformation of the monarchy, issues of succession could have been resolved without resorting to the arrests of rival princes. In Kuwait, for example, an independent national assembly votes on succession, mitigating against bitter monarchical rivalries.Though the prince built his reputation as a young moderniser, garnering favour among the western media as a monarch who could free Saudi Arabia from the shackles of religious conservatism, economic stagnation and a state-controlled economy, his idea of progress was always two-faced. Prince Mohammed allowed women to drive while presiding over the arrests of women’s rights activists and the criminalisation of feminism. He promised religious reforms and social liberalisation while detaining hundreds of religious scholars, activists and intellectuals.The young prince silenced debates inside the kingdom and pursued his critics abroad. The brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi was the final stroke in shattering his international reputation, while his decision to pursue a disastrous war in Yemen has embarrassed his western allies, which continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.But his propaganda abroad and deployment of thinktanks that promote his interests abroad and launder his reputation among a western political elite, ensured that he remained the preferred candidate of Donald Trump.His other western allies, above all Britain and France, turned a blind eye to the prince’s scandals as he continued to promise them investment and arms sales. When faced with a choice between trade or sanctions, western governments opted for the former – remaining silent over Saudi Arabia’s record on domestic repression, its war in Yemen and the fracturing of consensus among Gulf countries following Saudi Arabia’s dispute with Qatar in 2014.The current leadership crisis is a clear sign that the future of reform in Saudi Arabia remains ambiguous at best. Without a consensus over his reforms and foreign and domestic policies, Prince Mohammed has resorted to repression. As the young prince attempts to tighten his hold on power, we can expect more arrests to follow.• Madawi al-Rasheed is a visiting professor at the London School of Economics’s Middle East Centre and the author of Salman’s Legacy: The Dilemmas of a new Era in Saudi Arabia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949e0a5ca3372aa052cbb08c174e59ae691a5e87/312_354_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55305ee4e105f02b93e88d1f7492ca1e","title":"the guardian view on the led zeppelin verdict a victory for creativity","story":"In a waspish lecture entitled The Hero as Man of Letters, the Victorian essayist and philosopher Thomas Carlyle sought to debunk the fashionable notion of the solitary Romantic genius. This idea, he suggested in 1840, was a contemporary fantasy: “Never, till about a hundred years ago, was there seen any figure of a Great Soul living apart in that anomalous manner endeavouring to speak forth the inspiration that was in him by Printed Books.” It didn’t work. Despite Carlyle’s best efforts, the alluring notion of pure, unmediated self-expression in the arts never really went away. As a consequence, from the Romantic era onwards, the moral implications of plagiarism began to become a seriously hot issue. If the best art was a unique emanation from the depth of an inidual’s soul, it was an outrage of the highest order to nick it and put it in your own stuff.Musical plagiarism has become a vexed issue in the United States music industry, in an age of sampling and sensitivities over cultural appropriation. Five years ago Marvin Gaye’s children were awarded $7.4m after jurors decided that, in their 2013 hit single Blurred Lines, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams had copied Gaye’s Got to Give It Up, from 1977. But when it comes to the question of who owns the opening sequence of perhaps the most celebrated rock song of all, it is hard not to conclude that Mr Skidmore has fallen for the old Romantic conceit. Because the truth is that no one does.The two snatches of music in Stairway and Taurus are undoubtedly very similar. But descending chromatic chords, which can convey a soulful, almost mystical melancholy, were highly popular in the often dreamy guitar music of the late 60s and early 70s. They also feature, as the court heard, in songs such as Chim Chim Cher-ee from the 1964 film Mary Poppins. In previous centuries, JS Bach and Henry Purcell were fans.Copyright rulings should not be so draconian that they inhibit the creative process. Sometimes a kind of music or thinking is a common cultural resource its inflections and idioms can subconsciously influence and inspire an age, a moment or a mood. Mr Page testified in 2016 that the disputed chord sequence “had been around for ever”. A seminal study of plagiarism in the Romantic period by Tilar J Mazzeo points out that, at that time, culpable borrowing was defined as that which is “simultaneously unacknowledged, unimproved, unfamiliar, and conscious”. Led Zeppelin lovers can rest easy on that score."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54216b754d6694ce51acd0dcb35fde6292b8f6aa/0_6_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f762950f8878deb74a7cec326d9821de","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of abundance","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘abundance’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘abundance’.Share your photos of what abundance means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 11 March at 10am.

The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world. Scientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be erted away from climate action.The climate assessment is led by the UN’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN’s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres.The report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began. The long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent – usually the lowest of the year – the third worst on record.“Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris agreement calls for,” said Guterres. 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. “Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies.”Prof Brian Hoskins, of Imperial College London, said: “The report is a catalogue of weather in 2019 made more extreme by climate change, and the human misery that went with it. It points to a threat that is greater to our species than any known virus – we must not be erted from the urgency of tackling it by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions to zero as soon as possible.”Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950sLyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API\u0026nbspwarned\u0026nbspthe industry: “Time is running out.”Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases.A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”.The Nasa scientist\u0026nbspJames Hansen testifies to the US Senate\u0026nbspthat “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.”A\u0026nbspconfidential report\u0026nbspprepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states.Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies\u0026nbspestablish\u0026nbspthe Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions.Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research.Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”.At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.”Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out\u0026nbspan ad in The New York Times\u0026nbsptitled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.”The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC.The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose\u0026nbspmain donors\u0026nbspare in the oil and gas industry,\u0026nbspleads\u0026nbspthe “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which\u0026nbspends in disarray.A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals\u0026nbsp90 companies\u0026nbspare responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century.The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry.Exxon, Chevron and BP each\u0026nbspdonate at least $500,000\u0026nbspfor the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the\u0026nbspbiggest threat\u0026nbspto the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.The WMO said its report provided authoritative information for policymakers on the need for climate action and showed the impacts of extreme weather.A heatwave in Europe was made five times more likely by global heating, and the scorching summer led to 20,000 emergency hospital admissions and 1,462 premature deaths in France alone. India and Japan also sweltered and Australia started and ended the year with severe heat and had its driest year on record. Australia had “an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season”, the WMO noted.Floods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and its neighbours, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018.The US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.Unpredictable climate and extreme weather was a factor in 26 of the 33 nations that were hit by food crises in 2019, and was the main driver in 12 of the countries. “After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again – over 820 million suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available,” the report says.The WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.Prof Dave Reay, of the University of Edinburgh, said: “This annual litany of climate change impacts and inadequate global responses makes for a gut-wrenching read. Writ large is the ‘threat multiplier’ effect that is climate change on the biggest challenges faced by humanity and the world’s ecosystems in the 21st century.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d41bfd73983fe6a41d78ac3821a6ec624e956e/0_194_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55439298478992b08e7c79d6cc0e83d","title":"more funds needed for new trees in england say campaigners","story":"Government failing on pledge to plant 30,000 hectares by 2024, says Friends of the EarthTree planting is one of the government’s key strategies for fighting the climate crisis, but ministers have got off to a slow start that shows little sign of speeding up, according to the latest figures: just £5.2m will be spent on new trees in England under the countryside stewardship scheme for the current financial year.That is enough for only 1,260 hectares, according to Friends of the Earth, which is calling for a greater effort on tree-planting to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Under current plans – revealed in the answer to a parliamentary question by the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy – about £27m will be spent by the end of this parliament, enough for about 6,500ha of forest.These sums fall far short of the 30,000ha of new trees the government has pledged.Friends of the Earth revealed last year that ministers were failing to meet targets on trees, despite assurances from the government that forestry would form a central plank of the push to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Less than £2 per person was being spent on forestry, research found.Each of the major parties included substantial tree-planting pledges in their manifestos at last autumn’s general election. However, details from the government on how this will be achieved have been scant.The agriculture bill currently progressing through parliament will put in place a broad legal framework to reward farmers for providing public goods, such as tree planting, but there have been no concrete plans yet from ministers on how much farmers can expect to be paid, when and how such schemes will be managed.There are also increasing questions over the strategy, which has the backing in principle of many environmental groups, but must be worked out in careful detail if new forests are to be sited in the right places so as to preserve existing habitats and not lead to further unintended emissions.Experts told the  this week that commercial forests would provide little gain in the UK’s ability to store carbon. They also said trees planted in the wrong places could increase emissions, for instance, planting trees in some peatland dries out the peat and causes it to release carbon into the air.Other plantations can threaten local birds and wildlife if not carefully managed.He said: “Ministers love to talk about planting more trees to fight the climate emergency, but seem unprepared to put their money where their mouth is. We have enough land but not yet the political will.”He called on the chancellor to act in Wednesday’s budget. “This budget is an opportunity to free up funding to create and maintain woodlands. Nature benefits from more trees, people feel better, and of course trees help combat climate change so there is absolutely no excuse to skimp on this funding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a515957b916b9e5724dd733ce3bf99f32112607/2_0_1012_607/master/1012.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=338449193f5da3c31ceee99d4bce1d27","title":"why cycling in palestine is an intensely political act","story":"Riding is way of thumbing the nose at occupation and connecting with the land Are you annoyed by the anti-motorcycle barriers or speed bumps on your local bike path? Spare a thought for Palestinian bicycle advocates. According to the UN, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank imposes 705 obstacles to the free movement of Palestinians.These obstacles include military checkpoints where only those with permits can pass, a 440-mile separation barrier, and roving patrols that can turn a joyous bike ride into humiliating roadside detention.For Palestinian paramedic Sohaib Samara and other cyclists in the region, pedalling is not just about fresh air and exercise it’s intensely, unavoidably political.On one ride when he and a friend were pulled over by an Israeli army patrol, Samara says he heard the soldiers asking, in Hebrew, whether they should shoot the pair in the arms.“Your brain starts to wander in dark places when, really, you just want to keep cycling,” he added.Riding around the West Bank is a way of thumbing the nose at occupation, but it is also a way of connecting with the land bicycling as a form of affirmative action.In 2016, Samara launched Ramallah Riders, a Facebook group for would-be cyclists in the West Bank town of Ramallah, six miles north of Jerusalem. Four years later, the group now has 3,000 members and, in recognition of wider West Bank membership, is today known as Cycling Palestine.When I lived in Jerusalem for six months in 1984 – having ridden to Israel on my Claud Butler Majestic touring bike – I used to ride out to West Bank villages on weekends with an Israeli friend. We were welcomed with handshakes and mint tea. We were exotic, but we were on bicycles, a form of locomotion that identified us as harmless idiots to Palestinians and Israelis alike.Israel has since had something of a bicycling boom. Along with amenities such as a billionaire-backed velodrome, it also now has protected cycleways, and the Giro d’Italia pro-cycling race spent three days in the country in 2018. But despite the best efforts of Cycling Palestine, the West Bank remains a bicycling backwater.Ignoring the barbs, Samara continued to cycle.“We’ve been doing this for over four years now people have lost hope in us,” joked Malak Hasan, Cycling Palestine’s co-organiser. “They’re now more accepting.”I was speaking to Samara and Hasan in the foyer of the Manger Square Hotel in Bethlehem after an e-bike tour of the city, a new weekly organised ride which had taken me past highlights such as Banksy’s Walled Off Hotel, a greater draw for some than the town’s Church of the Nativity.The e-bike tour aims to get tourists out of buses to see the “real” Bethlehem.This isn’t always easy in the West Bank. It’s hilly, it’s hot for much of the year, and cycling is still considered an odd thing to do, especially for women.The cultural stigma – a barrier to bicycling – is lower for men. “Men can embark on amazing adventures because no one will be asking where this man is sleeping. Where is he going? Is he alone?”After a four-day, 300-mile group ride in 2017 from the Qalandiya refugee camp near Ramallah to Jordan’s Aqaba, Hasan returned to stinging rebukes. She was one of only two women on the 11-person trip.“Most of the comments were like, ‘how could you sleep in tents and on deserted roads with nine men?’ The expectation is for a woman to be at home, taking care of babies, being decent and modest.”Hasan’s husband doesn’t cycle, “but,” she stated proudly, “he’s very supportive”.She learned to love cycling when studying for a master’s degree in communication in Swansea.One of Cycling Palestine’s recent tours was a multi-day, 70-person tour following the full length of the separation barrier: their own form of rolling resistance.“It is our duty to keep our relationship with this land,” said Samara. “If we stop moving around, the occupiers will steal more of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c0d440994a5df6244879ac4d6cced5e66cccaa8/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0b882cb924343c752bb297b410a4958","title":"lost girls review well intentioned but plodding netflix true drama","story":"The story of sex workers murdered by a still-uncaught serial killer makes for a pedestrian narrative debut for documentarian Liz GarbusPremiering at the tail-end of this year’s Sundance film festival to faint applause, the earnest fact-based drama Lost Girls has made a swift beeline less than two months later for its rightful home: Netflix. While the platform has increasingly stretched itself to prove that it can, or at least try to, do everything, one of its most consistently popular subgenres is true crime, proved by everything from Making a Murderer to the recent hit The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, appealing to an endless, morally dubious, public lust for violence, tragedy and, sometimes, justice.Its output in this area can often feel exploitative, not a word that describes Lost Girls, a sensitively made yet frustratingly plodding film based on a still unsolved spate of killings by the so-called Long Island Serial Killer, detailed in a bestselling book by journalist Robert Kolker. Police believe that he killed between 10 and 16 people over a 20-year period but the film zeroes in on one missing young woman and how the search for her led to the discovery of four other bodies. It’s a tale of righteous indignation, police incompetence and the inability of men with authority to listen to and believe the voices of women. Mari Gilbert (Amy Ryan) is a mother struggling on the breadline, working two jobs to try to provide for her two daughters. A third, her eldest Shannan, lives elsewhere with Mari reluctantly asking her for financial assistance every now and then. Exactly where Shannan gets her money from is unspoken but known by Mari, a family secret that gets unearthed when Shannan goes missing.As a sex worker who found her clients on Craigslist (the perpetrator was also known as the Craigslist Killer), Shannan was quickly ignored or at least de-prioritised by police, who judged her in the same broad and moralistic way that the media also did at the time. Unwilling to let her daughter’s disappearance become old news, Mari rallies together with the families of women whose bodies have been found and starts to put the pieces together with or without police help.Lost Girls is the first narrative feature from documentarian Liz Garbus, whose previous subjects have covered everything from Nina Simone to the Holocaust, and throughout the film, she struggles to find the right balance between muted naturalism and button-pushing Hollywood formula. Admirable restraint in some scenes is followed by crusty cliche in others and while some actors dial it down, others lean into tropes, such as Lola Kirke as a cartoonish prostitute and 30 Rock’s Dean Winters as a bumbling cop. Ryan is similarly unmodulated, believably raw at times and then uncomfortably grandstanding at others. It’s a pleasure to see her given so much screen time but it’s not a performance that ever cuts quite as deep as it needs to, our emotional attachment to the unfolding devastation wavering at best.Garbus and screenwriter Michael Werwie embed the film with a timely anger, showing us an all-too-familiar culture of victim-shaming and unfairly attributed blame, all at the feet of women. There’s also an undercurrent of respect afforded to those working in the sex industry who too often get labelled on and off screen and the film is never less than well-intentioned but intentions only get us so far. As sincere and as sensitive as the film might be, it’s never as involving or as effective as the story at its centre. One of the most shocking details is revealed in a text coda which thrusts a poorly developed subplot to the forefront, one of many strands and character dynamics that don’t get enough time or depth.

Email feast@theI’ve tried to replicate paellas I’ve had in Spain, but none matches the colour, fragrance and subtlety of the real thing. Where am I going wrong?Chris, Paignton, DevonSpanish uber-chef Quique Dacosta, who last year opened his first UK restaurant, the paella-based Arros QD in London, agrees: “All the ingredients are important, but the king is the stock, because that’s where much of the flavour comes from.” For this reason, he never uses concentrate or cube, and insists it’s made from scratch, “mainly because you have no control over its quality otherwise, and also because the whole paella ritual always starts with the stock”.Angel Zapata Martin, head chef at the four-strong Barrafina group of restaurants in London, makes his stock first by roasting the bones, trimmings and shells of whatever meat or seafood he’s using in the paella, then puts them in a pot with shallot, carrot, fennel, garlic, tomato paste and pimientos choricero (dried pepper) or pimentón, all topped with water. “The secret is not to use too much, or you’ll end up with a bland stock,” he says. “Three fingers above the solids is plenty.”The type of rice is also critical, all three cooks agree, and it has to be Spanish medium-grain. Pizarro and Dacosta recommend senia rice from Valencia, the home of paella, but say bomba or albufera will also do the trick Zapata is rather more specific: “The rice is key – I use only Illa de Riu bomba from southern Catalunya, which benefits from the rich soil in which its grown.”Paella is, of course, named after the pan in which it’s traditionally made, and Dacosta is adamant you shouldn’t really call it paella if it’s not cooked in one: “It’s just not the same in a frying pan.” Zapata, however, isn’t quite so strict on this particular score: “Yes, a proper paella pan is preferable,” he agrees, “but the closest you have to a very wide, flat pan should be OK.”Once you’ve fried off the sofrito base – diced onion, garlic, tomato and, perhaps, red pepper – and browned the meat, stir in the rice to coat, pour in the stock … and leave well alone: “Never stir paella,” Pizarro warns, a sentiment Zapata endorses: “It makes the rice go stodgy and mushy.” We’re not making a risotto here, after all.Dacosta uses 1,200ml stock per 240g rice, and cooks it for 20 minutes precisely – “We start counting the moment the stock goes in the pan” – until the liquid’s absorbed and the rice is plump. The Valencian way, he says, is to end up with a thin layer of flavour-filled rice with a crisp base, or soccarat. To get the same effect, Zapata recommends leaving the pan on the heat for a short while after the rice is cooked, “until you hear it sizzle and see the edges crisp”. Mind you, Dacosta adds, “not all paellas have soccarat and not everyone loves it”.Another flaw of many a dodgy paella, Dacosta says, is that “the vegetables are often horribly overcooked by the time the rice is ready”, so add them only after it’s half-cooked. “And always use proper saffron,” Pizarro says, “never turmeric or colourant – that’s sacrilege.”A scattering of fresh herbs and a dash of lemon is all you really need to finish, but for a more cheffy flourish, Zapata adds a picada for a last hit of flavour: “Blend saffron, raw or roast garlic and white wine, then pour all over the paella and leave to soak in for a few minutes before serving.” ¡Buen provecho!• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Johnnie Walker-owner Diageo has made a splash with its non-alcoholic spirit Seedlip while Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken have launched dozens of no and low-alcohol beers.Siba has confirmed that this year’s BeerX event in Liverpool – expected to attract more than 2,000 visitors over Wednesday and Thursday – will go ahead as planned despite worries about coronavirus.

Four more goals were scored by Gian Piero Gasperini’s side as they progressed to the quarter-finals in their first season in the Champions League having defeated Valencia 8-4 on aggregate, a 4-3 victory in Spain following the 4-1 win at San Siro.At the final whistle they gathered, posed for a photo with a T-shirt telling their virus-hit city: “Bergamo, this is for you: never give up”, and celebrated, every word of it audible. Meanwhile their opponents headed swiftly down the tunnel and out of Europe.As Atalanta broke, Josip Ilicic signalled for the ball he so thoroughly deserved. He, too, had made history, becoming the first player to score four goals away from home in this competition. At the end of the night, there should have been applause, a standing ovation for him. There should have been for his teammates too, a side who care nothing for orthodoxy, preferring always to attack, and one that had brought joy to a region where there is too little right now. And maybe even for Valencia who had at least made this enjoyable. Instead, there was silence.It had all played out before an empty stadium, closed because of the coronavirus. It was to their credit that these two teams had made it this good, but there was something missing – and you could not help wondering how much better it might have been with people there. Four goals from Ilicic, two from Kevin Gameiro and one from Ferran Torres deserved an audience, even if deep down Valencia always knew progressing was beyond them. A 4-1 deficit would have been hard enough to overturn anyway without their fans it was always likely to be impossible.When Valencia’s bus arrived at the Mestalla it was greeted by hundreds of supporters, singing and swirling scarves. The aim was to create a communion, the culture needed for a comeback, which they knew could not last. None of them could get in the ground but, while most then made their way home, some chose instead to stay and watch the game from the cluster of bars just outside – highlighting one potential flaw in playing behind closed doors.From there, it seemed, the players could hear them singing. But the quality of the sound soon suggested that some of these chants were pre-recorded and played out over the PA system. First, though, it breathlessly announced the lineups to … who exactly? Then they blasted out the Champions League anthem while in the centre circle that ball-shaped tarpaulin was waggled about as always. It had barely been packed away when Valencia’s hopes had been, too.Mouctar Diakhaby gave away two penalties, both unnecessary, and any belief Valencia had that they could turn this around had gone in little more than 60 seconds: 1.25 the clock said when Diakhaby brought down Ilicic, the night’s outstanding player. The Slovenian got up and scored the penalty to make it 1-0, 5-2 on aggregate, watched by the only fan inside Mestalla: Vicente Navarro, a blind supporter, who passed away a few years ago but a statute of him occupies his seat and it sat, alone, in the stand.Otherwise there were a few directors, players and coaching staff, some officials, a handful of ball boys and a solitary steward at each end, and that was it. In one stand a banner said: “our hearts and our support, always in Mestalla”. If the fans could be heard from outside and from loud speakers, on the television sets upon which everyone everywhere had to watch, you could hear the players: every kick, every word.When Ilicic prepared to take the first penalty the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, could clearly be heard telling Jasper Cillessen to stay on his line. “I’m good,” he replied, but he wasnot and nor was this. It is not just the stadium that is empty, it is the whole thing. However good a match is – and this really was very good indeed – it is not really a match in these conditions. Attempts to palliate the absence of fans with piped-in chants and paraphernalia made it more pathetic somehow, oddly surreal.That said, as an exhibition it was very enjoyable. As a competition it was over already, although there was much to come. Rodrigo Moreno had drawn an early save and Valencia drew level on twenty minutes when Gameiro went around the goalkeeper and scored. Outside, there was a delayed cheer. Inside, Francois Coquelin and Cillessen both had to react fast to deny Ilicic. Diakhaby, by contrast, invited him back in: an unwisely outstretched arm gifted another penalty before half-time, from which Ilicic made it 2-1.Diakhaby did not come back out, replaced by Gonçalo Guedes. Valencia were going to try this at least, even though they needed five.They got two. So did Atalanta, though. Gameiro headed in Torres’s cross before Torres lobbed Valencia into the lead, but it did not last. Ilicic combined with Duván Zapata, stepped away from Dani Parejo and scored his third. Then, with nine minutes left he bend in a historic fourth. At the very end, Gameiro might have score the hat-trick that would have meant sharing the ball, a memento from an odd night, but his shot rebounded back off the goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, the sound echoing around an empty arena."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d584686f7c26fb8eac8caaffd21c4b845e36e430/0_114_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9cbc29d33a9f43db20d3f7a397afcb1","title":"arsenal self isolation postpone game manchester city premier league coronavirus covid 19","story":"The Premier League game between Manchester City and Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday has been postponed “as a precautionary measure” due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Premier League has said. Following the news that Olympiakos owner Evangelos Marinakis had contracted the virus, Arsenal confirmed that an unspecified number of unnamed players met Marinakis after their Europa League tie on the 27 February and that those players are now in self-isolation.The Premier League said in a statement: “Following medical advice, Arsenal FC and Manchester City FC consider it is necessary to postpone their fixture due to be played this evening to give time to fully assess the situation. The Premier League has therefore agreed that tonight’s game will be rearranged.”Marinakis was seen on the pitch at the Emirates after Olympiakos’ Europa League victory, applauding the away fans after the full-time whistle had gone. Arsenal released a statement on Wednesday morning with more details on who exactly was directly exposed to Marinakis that night.“We identified that a number of players met the Olympiakos owner immediately following the game,” read the statement. “The medical advice we have received puts the risk of them developing Covid-19 at extremely low. However, we are strictly following the government guidelines which recommend that anyone coming into close contact with someone with the virus should self-isolate at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact.“As a result, the players are unavailable for tonight’s match against Manchester City and the Premier League has decided the game should be postponed. The players will remain at their homes until the 14-day period expires. Four Arsenal staff, who were sitting close to Mr Marinakis during the match will also remain at home until the 14 days are complete.”The statement continued: “We fully understand how disappointing this is for our supporters, in particular those who were travelling to Manchester for tonight’s match. Tickets will be valid for the match when it’s rearranged.The threat of the coronavirus is leading to increased measures being taken across England and the continent. Chelsea’s Champions League match with Bayern Munich is to be played behind closed doors, as will multiple Europa League ties including Wolves, Manchester United and Rangers. Wolves have now condemned Uefa for not postponing their Europa League tie with Olympiakos on Thursday after the news of Marinakis’s condition became public.French authorities said upcoming matches in Ligue 1 would be played behind closed doors. In Spain the same decision prompted the players’ union to call for matches to be suspended instead. The German FA took the decision to cancel an international friendly with Italy. In Italy, where a suspension of competition is already in place, officials have been asked to come up with ways to finish the Serie A season – including deciding the title in a play‑off.In England, meanwhile, a packed Anfield will host a Champions League tie against Atlético Madrid on Wednesday night and this weekend’s Premier League fixtures are set to go ahead with no alteration. English football’s approach, directed by government advice and described by some in the game as “keep calm and carry on”, is looking increasingly out of step with that of other countries.

The season is in danger of fizzling out for Mourinho’s side and their poor form in the Premier League has left them lagging behind in the race to secure Champions League football.“With the squad we have at the moment it is going to be very, very difficult,” Mourinho said. “Our problems are not going to disappear tomorrow. We will fight until the end.“In the Premier League we don’t have results where we have no chance to fight for the points. We lost 3-2, 2‑1, 1-0, we had draws, so it’s not like we can’t fight.

The reality is a different thing. One team is much stronger. Of course it was difficult and Leipzig clearly deserve to get to the quarter-finals. Every team in the world would struggle with five or six of their most important players missing.

It was an experience that drove his ambition higher, sowing the seeds for a nation-building project and his decision to run for president.Burundi goes to the polls on 20 May and Nahimana, standing as an independent, has a manifesto of unity.“In our country political parties have developed out of ethnic isions,” he says. “But the people helping my campaign come from all ethnic groups. Together, we are showing it’s time to value life in Burundi.”Burundi was granted independence from colonial Belgian rule.\u0026nbspThe assassination of Hutu prime minister\u0026nbspPierre Ngendandumwe\u0026nbspset in motion a\u0026nbspseries of assassinations, revolts, coups and\u0026nbspregional instability\u0026nbspthat ended with Burundi established as a republic and one-party state.\u0026nbspA Hutu rebellion is brutally crushed leaving 200,000 to 300,000 dead.\u0026nbsp150,000 people die in unrest after a military coup.Burundi\u0027s civil war erupts after the assassination of Hutu leader Melchior Ndadaye. Years of violence between Hutu rebels and the Tutsi army claim 300,000 civilian lives.\u0026nbspMost of the warring factions sign the peace deal iding key government and military posts between Hutu and Tutsi.\u0026nbspPierre Nkurunziza, a former Hutu rebel leader, is elected president.In May Nkurunziza was anointed as eternal supreme guide by the ruling party. But by June he announced that he would not seek another term and step down when his current term ends in 2020.Too often life has seemed to hold low worth in Burundi, whose history has been marked by occupation, civil war and intermittent violence between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis. Last month more than 6,000 bodies were found in six mass graves in Karusi province, the largest discovery since the government began excavations in January in a nationwide programme intended to help the east African country come to terms with its past.Nahimana lost his father and 18 relatives in the civil war and genocide which left 300,000 people dead. He believes ethnic disputes can finally be set aside in the election for a leader to replace President Pierre Nkurunziza, who has held office since the conflict ended in 2005.“This time the elections are going to focus on development and stability of the country, not on fixing the same issues that have been around for a long time,” Nahimana says. “We always knew this election would be the time for a new generation who want something other than the cycle of retribution. For nearly 20 years we’ve been training young people for decision-making positions and we knew they would be ready.”More than 6,000 young people have come through his New Generation leadership programme. They work as government advisers, bank managers, church leaders and in other influential positions, all ready to support his campaign and government, says Nahimana, whose family share his home with approximately 80 former street children.He believes Burundi is ripe for transformation, especially as the 1994 peace accord process of balancing ethnic groups in the army – intended to prevent Hutu rebellions against Tutsi leadership – has now been completed.Yet political violence has persisted in 2015 protesters clashed with police over Nkurunziza’s announcement that he would prolong his presidency and tensions erupted again before a referendum on allowing his third term. About 400,000 people have fled the country and hundreds have been killed. The UN, which has accused the government and its supporters of crimes against humanity, has warned of serious human rights violations.“We are not trying to be the next government in the same way. The government of Burundi has existed in the same way since the 1960s – militarily-led to manage crises – with almost all of the budget and focus on fixing these crises.”If he wins: “The number one priority for us will be to create an environment for peace and healing, because Burundians have been wounded by what happened in the past.“When you live in an environment where you do not know if you will be alive the next day, or if civil war will erupt in five or 10 years, you cannot plan for the future.”He claims he would tackle rampant corruption and remove barriers to young people’s involvement in managing the country – and it would rapidly develop agriculture, he says, pointing to Rwanda as an example of a country with a similar size population and history whose successful development shows what can be done. “In 1996 they were far behind Burundi but they developed quickly using just the resources they had.”As the national Truth and Reconciliation Commission has worked to repair rifts, the government has recognised Nahimana’s “healing memories” project, bringing together the genocide’s young victims and perpetrators. “We raised them to live as one community without considering where they came from.”“Because we are known for our peace and reconciliation work, the media does not attack us,” he says, adding that while there can be no guarantee elections will be free and fair, so far his campaign has observed the electoral commission is doing its job. But protection of the human rights of all Burundians would be an immediate priority – with support from the international community – and there would be an early discussion on rejoining the International Criminal Court, which, in 2017, Burundi became the first country in the world to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1e31aa2bfc861edd09c83204130af7f5944bbb5/0_139_2143_1286/master/2143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0feb4948931a8342b38b87d39f7f29f8","title":"schools close in north east kenya after al shabaab targets teachers","story":"Authorities face criticism for withdrawing teaching staff from an already marginalised region where education is badly neededA series of targeted killings of schoolteachers by a militia group in Kenya has seen an exodus of staff and the closure of hundreds of schools across the north-east of the country.Thousands of teachers have left their posts in the past two months following several suspected al-Shabaab attacks in the region.Schools in rural areas near the Somali border have been badly hit. On 13 January, suspected members of the Somalia-based terrorist group al-Shabaab attacked the village of Kamuthe in Garissa county and killed three non-local teachers and destroyed a communication mast.A few days earlier, a boarding school in another remote village in the Dadaab area of Garissa was targeted by al-Shabaab attackers, according to the Kenyan police. They killed three students and a teacher.Predominantly inhabited by ethnic Somalis, north-eastern Kenya shares a long, porous border with Somalia and it is one of the country’s most marginalised areas. It is inhabited mostly by nomadic pastoralists whose access to education has been limited.“When the teachers leave, the students go back to their nomadic lifestyle,” said Ahmed Abdi Mohamed, headteacher of Balambala boarding school, Garissa county, where seven non-local teachers have left in recent weeks.“I see my students looking after animals every day in the village, it pains me but there is nothing I can do. When I ask the parents they tell me why waste their children’s time in an empty school when they can utilise them to look after their livestock.“The local community had already lost hope, it would be difficult to win them back even if we get new teachers because of the nomadic lifestyle. Many of them would have gone to far places with their livestock in search of pasture.”Local leaders and members of parliament argue the mass transfer of teachers by the government is an indication of the continued marginalisation of the region’s people.“The insecurity problem has been going on for many years, but the national government did not take the matter seriously,” he said.Al-Shabaab has staged frequent attacks inside Kenya. In 2015 an attack on Garissa University College killed 148 students.“The national government forced us to keep the schools open symbolically because shutting them down means al-Shabaab would win,” said Mohamed. “But they are not doing anything practical on the ground to help with the continuity of learning.”Leaders have criticised the TSC, the national body responsible for teachers’ employment, for creating an “education crisis” in the region by pulling non-local staff out of schools in the area.The TSC has insisted that teachers will not be posted to the north-eastern region until their safety is assured.“We appreciate the security challenges we are facing but the decision to transfer all non-local teachers from public schools was reckless,” said Maalim. “This jeopardises the future of children in north-eastern Kenya, who have long struggled to meet the national average standards in exams.”Abdinoor Alimahadi, an education technologist who comes from the region, has been campaigning with local governors to adopt available technology to fill the gap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf43c44268a193fabddabd6d905a483a80dbd917/0_0_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4514c0887b199e67b6156cc4ce7d19","title":"looking for love wash your hands first say dating apps","story":"How dating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirusDating apps are adapting to love in the time of coronavirus, warning their users of the elevated risks of going on dates while trying to ensure they do not switch off entirely when the time comes to self-isolate.OKCupid, which prides itself on its data-led approach to dating, asking users to fill in detailed questionnaires and matching them with others who give similar answers, has sent a push alert to every user asking them an additional question: “Does coronavirus affect your dating life?”Other dating apps have taken a softer approach, at least for the time being.

In its opening couple of pages alone, he describes himself as “a self-made, man-mad man”, “a living legend” and “one of the last pop moguls … a dying breed, the kind that did it in style”.Certainly, he was a manager in a grand British pop tradition that stretched back to Larry Parnes and Brian Epstein. Like them, he was a gay man who felt he implicitly understood what pop’s primary market of teenage girls wanted: he explained his thinking behind 90s boyband East 17 with the words “we all like a bit of rough”. He was cultured – a trained designer with a fondness for the Bauhaus movement and a background working for Terence Conran, Watkins was rather more of an aesthete than his brash public image suggested – and nearly as well-known as the artists he ostensibly worked for. Indeed, Watkins was so enamoured of said tradition that he occasionally attempted to pass himself off as Jewish, one attribute he didn’t share with its founding fathers.His earliest forays into management involved transforming two south London pub bands into would-be glam rock stars Ice Cream and Giggles. In the long run, their abject commercial failure turned out to be their selling-point – decades after their release, both Ice Cream’s solitary single Shout It Out and Giggles’ Glad to Be Alive and Just Another Saturday Night became hugely collectable examples of junk shop glam, a subgenre predicated on the bands’ initial obscurity. But while attempting to hustle them to the top, Watkins established his standard managerial style: ruthlessly dictatorial about everything from his artists’ sound to their appearance to their logos. By his own admission a frustrated pop star, Watkins saw himself as a svengali rather than a mere music industry deal-maker.The failure of Ice Cream and Giggles, as well as a soft rockfunk band called Grand Hotel, caused Watkins to return to design. When his company XL was employed to design sleeves and adverts for the new ZTT label, he noted with approval the degree of control the label’s in-house producer Trevor Horn and marketing and promotions guru Paul Morley exerted over their biggest act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood. That Frankie had become the UK’s biggest pop sensation of 1984 seemed to confirm that Watkins’ way of thinking yielded results, although his attempt to achieve something similar with a hopelessly limp, Stock, Aitken and Waterman-produced trio called Spelt Like This came to nothing.Ironically, Watkins’ first success as a manager came with a band implacably resistant to his domineering style. He had initially met Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys when borrowing a Spider-Man costume for Giggles’ stage act from Marvel comics, then Tennant’s employer. Impressed by the songs Tennant had authored with Chris Lowe, he accepted their offer to manage them – the duo were impressed by his connections to Frankie Goes to Hollywood – but also noted that the pair were smarter than him. He secured them a deal with Parlophone but found his suggestions about their music and image went largely unheeded. They parted company at the height of the Pet Shop Boys’ success.His next project, however, was more Watkins’ style. He gave Bros their name, designed their logo and radically overhauled their image, sending them to the era’s hippest London hair salon Cuts and dressing them in clothes you would have seen at an illegal warehouse party. He co-wrote every song on their debut album Push under a pseudonym, the Brothers, designed to fool audiences into thinking Matt and Luke Goss had done it themselves. Bros were a smash hit – Push sold 10m copies and spawned five Top 5 singles – but the great flaw in Watkins’ managerial process was swiftly revealed: even manufactured pop artists were disinclined to, as he put it, “put up, shut up and mime” once they had achieved vast success.A brief attempt to manage post-acid house electronic band Electribe 101 left Watkins convinced he should stick to mainstream pop. He built a band around a young songwriter called Tony Mortimer. A “bad boy” counterpart to the more parent-friendly Take That, East 17 went onto become vastly successful: among their singles lurked a cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ West End Girls, suggested by Watkins primarily in an attempt to irritate his former charges. Their career abruptly came to a halt when the band’s loosest cannon, Brain Harvey, announced during a 1997 radio interview that he’d taken 12 ecstasy tablets in a night. A gleeful hedonist himself, Watkins thought that Harvey was exaggerating – “You can’t take 13 Es in a night,” he offered, “your cock would be dropping off” – and that the ensuing furore, which quickly spiralled to the point that the then-prime minister John Major became involved, was hypocritical. Perhaps that was why he seemed incapable of containing the damage: Harvey was fired, and East 17 collapsed shortly afterwards.Their demise marked the end of Watkins’ reign in the music industry. Some of his subsequent ideas were intriguing and ahead of their time – an openly gay boyband called 2wo Third3, a pre-Gorillaz cartoon pop star called Kulkarni – but none of them stuck. He came closest with North and South, a boyband launched via a children’s BBC show (an idea subsequently reused to far greater effect by Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller with S Club 7), but was retired by the turn of the millennium, retreating to the south coast, where he designed and built an award-winning, Bauhaus-inspired home and opened a restaurant. He professed himself horrified by the impact of TV talent shows on pop, making the point that while his autocratic style had paved way for Simon Cowell, at least he’d chosen interesting or quirky figures to impose his will on.You could spot his affection for a different era by the way his autobiography repeatedly used the kind of terms once common in the pages of Smash Hits, such as “down the dumper” and “the giddy carousel of pop”. The man who’d coined both of them, Neil Tennant, paid a kind of tribute to Watkins in the Pet Shop Boys’ musical Closer to Heaven: the character of Bob Saunders, a brazen loudmouth manager required to sing the words: “I have to admit, I’m an absolute shit”, bore a suspicious resemblance to him. It says something about Tom Watkins that he professed himself absolutely delighted: whatever you thought of his managerial approach and his influence on pop, you could never have accused him of taking himself too seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e668b0b7f2afdd4cb81795a44f6fde7fff6c5f2a/1348_571_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6498c8a6c8e7ef4fab1495a501f5991a","title":"hadley freeman search uncover family secrets podcast","story":"When Hadley Freeman found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family’s history and her grandmother’s escape to America from the Nazis.

We take a closer look at the well-known investment safe havenGold is the original precious metal. It is rich in symbolism but it’s also rich in function. Over millennia, it has been used for coins, jewellery, ornamentation, medals, electronic components, the basis of monetary systems and the titles of countless James Bond films. But, recently, people have been reminded of its historic use as a comparatively safe store of value.The bank was explaining why it still kept gold reserves. But during these times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, its words sparked media discussions about investors buying up gold in a flight to financial safety.Unlike cash, the value of gold isn’t eroded by inflation. It is highly fungible and can easily be converted into hard currency wherever you are in the world. In extreme cases, such as in war-torn countries, if you lose everything else, you can carry a couple of small gold bars out with you. It also has a great heritage and global branding given that people have historically relied on it during times of political turmoil. “For thousands of years gold has been a store of value,” says Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, the online consumer investing platform.In recent months, the value of gold has increased amid concerns about the global economy and the spectre of a full-scale trade war between the US and China. The price of gold hit £1,278 an ounce last September as large numbers of investors bought into the precious metal during something of a rush to so-called “safe-haven” assets. These are lower-risk assets that are expected to retain their value or even grow in value when other assets fall – thereby helping investors to limit their exposure to losses. “You want assets that perform when the stock market doesn’t,” says Lowcock.Other safe-haven investments include defensive stocks that are less vulnerable to economic downturns, such as utility companies, supermarkets and other businesses that provide everyday essentials. Likewise, bonds usually offer more predictable returns than shares, and certain currencies such as the Yen and Swiss Franc are also seen as safe-haven investments.But while gold arguably remains the best-known financial safe haven, its safety as an investment largely depends on what you’re looking for.One of gold’s chief disadvantages as an investment is that it doesn’t provide you with an income. It pays no interest or idends, unlike shares or cash on deposit. The only money you make on gold is capital appreciation when the price goes up. However, in an economic environment where interest rates are very low (and bond yields are also very low), a lack of income from gold may not be that much of an issue.A bigger problem perhaps is that gold prices can and do fluctuate – and often considerably. In Davos, in 2010, George Soros famously said: “When interest rates are low we have conditions for asset bubbles to develop, and they are developing at the moment. The ultimate asset bubble is gold.”It’s also worth remembering that all safe-haven investments have potential downsides. Indeed, the only safe haven that can’t lose you money is cash – although it can lose you value in high inflation environments and it generally provides a poor return in low inflation environments such as the one we’re currently in.Of course, economic fundamentals aside, centuries of symbolism mean that gold’s emotional and psychological value is unlikely to fade any time soon. And as our faith in our financial system is continually tested, perhaps it will one day come to symbolise the important value of safety as much as wealth.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

In his critically acclaimed one-man show, The Misfit Analysis, which premiered at the 2015 Edinburgh festival, he also challenged preconceptions about the autistic mind.He is currently starring in unReal City at Battersea Arts Centre in south London, in a virtual reality show he co-devised about life in a digital world. Binchy is also about to take on the role of part-time digital influencer at Access All Areas, a theatre company that puts on productions made by learning-disabled and autistic artists.He wants to reach more people so they understand the talent of performers like himself. “Social media can be really bad for people with learning disabilities or autism. It’s easy to hide behind a keyboard and bully other people. It’s also not real life … You can have a virtual home in a virtual world with a virtual social life, but we need people to have real lives in the real world, and real opportunities,” says Binchy.Binchy says: “You need to see yourself up there in order to be more confident and know that you’re also included in society. There are so many amazing performers with learning disability and autism out there who deserve an opportunity to show what they can do.”He wants to see more inclusive arts charities like Access All Areas set up. “The problem is that people often think that the only kind of theatre that neuroerse people can do is a tiny performance in a church hall … people see it and say ‘Ah, that’s nice they’re doing well’. But we don’t just want to get out of the house – we want a purpose in life and we need to earn money just like anyone else. When I earn money, I can make a better living for myself, I’m doing something I love and it’s being taken seriously.”Binchy is driven by the need to express himself “and wanting to show I’m doing something that I’m good at and have a talent for”.Binchy says people assume “we’re all just victims or vulnerable”. He adds: “We can be good, we can be bad. We can be funny.” How does he describe his disability? “I have emotional issues and I’m autistic. I’d also say that I sometimes struggle with mental health. But people want to put you in a box just called ‘autism’ – even if they don’t mean any harm, it’s not as simple as that. I don’t like being labelled.”Other challenges include society’s presumption that “people like us” are asexual. “I remember talking to someone who said ‘That’s nice’ when I introduced my girlfriend. That was so patronising. Why can’t someone like me be in a relationship?” When he toured the Midlands with his one-man show, a B\u0026ampB landlady spoke to his non-disabled colleague, not to him. He says: “She talked about me, not even looking at me. It made me feel terrible and like a child.” The actor also worries welfare reform is undermining people’s support. “I’m on universal credit – don’t get me started on that, it’s been a nightmare. It is so complicated and it’s hurting a lot of people.”Binchy says it is important that neuroerse performers don’t compare themselves with other disabled artists. “Everyone is an inidual,” he says. “We all have different talents and what you do will be unique.”Family: Single, one brother.Education: Springhallow secondary school, Ealing Acton College (BTec drama, Gatehouse – a transitional programme for autistic learners) Hammersmith College (life skills) Royal Central School of Speech and Drama (performance-making diploma).Public life: Public speaker at the 2015 Autism and Comedy Symposium at the University of Kent Ambitious About Autism eventsand at the Houses of Parliament launch of the NHS autismlearning disability initiative Ask Listen Do.Awards and honours: 2016: People’s Choice award for The Misfit Analysis at the Vault festival, London.Interests: Writing poetry, listening to music, swimming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c7c2349c14906b812761baf699f4b88ac7cd9a/0_0_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a3ff841bf3ea25888f4fcf28313eae","title":"feminist solidarity empowers everyone the movement must be trans inclusive","story":"Taking the side of the oppressed has long been feminism’s raison d’etre. Amid an explosion of misogyny in public life, compassion and unity are more important than everI have written nothing on trans issues for seven years. A now-familiar row had broken out in the feminist movement back then, and I assumed that feminism would soon re-orient itself away from which body parts define a woman and whether or not the word “womxn” signified an assault on our sense of selves, and towards what I thought was obviously the more fundamental question of the movement: who has it worse? Feminism, in my life’s experience of it, takes the side of the oppressed. That is our raison d’etre.So, anyway, I had seen this wonderful talk by Helen Belcher, who described the three ways in which trans people are portrayed and undermined, in the media and beyond. “The first is that they’re fraudulent. They’re not really who they say they are. We’d better humour them in their delusion. The second is trans as undeserving deviant. The third is trans as comedy.” Since then, this has intensified, with other, even more hostile, elements added: trans people as predators, the trans movement as deliberately poisoning the young. The savage mischief has seeped out of it. There is not much of the “We’d better humour them” any more.Even in 2013, though, it was clear that trans people were in the eye of a familiar set of prejudices, which any of us – gay, female, disabled, BAME – might recognise. The difference was that people had become much less likely than they once were to laugh openly at those with disabilities, or to raise an eyebrow when two men kissed or an upstart woman demanded a fundamental human right. As a cause matures, it gets to the point where everyone recognises that their inidual view no longer matters. But all that prejudice did not just evaporate, and the very idea of a trans person became its great release. All this pent up feeling exploded on to this one group, who – to put it mildly – could have done without it. It was, and remains, obvious which side feminism would be expected to take in this fight: the side of compassion and fellowship. We would recognise the importance of being an ally in a battle that we had been through.Seven years ago, I thought this was quite an emollient argument, having gone nowhere near definitions, biology or absolutes – a call to rejoice in everything that made the women’s movement meaningful and victorious: strength in numbers, solidarity and, ultimately, love.That is not how it played out. Women on the other side of this row were apoplectic, because if you celebrate compassion without explicitly agreeing with them, they would argue that you are calling them uncompassionate. I thought: I am never going anywhere near this again, which was cowardly I regret it.But I recall that not as a humble-brag-style apology, but because there is a bizarre idea ossifying that “real” feminists are being hounded out of the discursive space by trans activists. Rather, what has occurred is the systematic enclosure of the debate, so that unless you want to go to the mats about toilets, your point of view is not relevant.All kinds of voices have been excluded. The experience of trans men, for instance, has been more or less erased, because the core issues have been whittled down to such a sharp, conflicted point – do cis women need protected status? – that the very existence of trans men has become too inconvenient to accommodate. The mainstream feminist view, which is trans-inclusive, has been sidelined to maintain the fiction that this is a generational battle between old and young feminists. Again, it is tactical and convenient to portray trans inclusion as a Trojan horse that all the young idiots allow in, being unaware of the history of women’s rights. But it simply is not so. Just because you are middle aged does not mean you agree with Germaine Greer. On the flipside, it is convenient to find that your voice is not relevant to this debate, because the conflict runs so high. But that is not a sufficient response when the generosity of the movement is at stake.It is astonishing that the idea of the “women-only space” is being touted as a fundamental pillar of the movement, yet is completely stripped of the historical context of that. Women-only space was a realm protected from our Harvey Weinsteins, where we could talk about our Harvey Weinsteins it was not a hallowed place where we communicated through our ovaries. It was where we came together in unity against people who hated us. I can’t imagine the mindset that would exclude a trans sister from that.The fact is, in every backlash against every civil rights movement, there have been people saying: your emancipation is not possible for operational reasons. You can’t have the vote because your hands are too small. You can’t use the swimming pool because your hygiene is not the same . I find this egregious. What are we doing, trying to consecrate the public lavatory as a place so precious to the experience of womanhood that we have to be exclusive, rather than inclusive that we have to characterise ourselves as a set of vulnerabilities, rather than strengths?So much of the live combat happens on Twitter. This is not to call it irrelevant (I love Twitter), but might be cause to reflect. It really suits the “alt-right” to see feminist discourse mired in this. There is so much else we could be doing. The two major transnational grassroots movements of the recent past are the climate strikes and the women’s marches. Their combined energy – bearing in mind how much crossover there is in those communities – would be awesome.We are witnessing an explosion of misogyny at the highest levels of public life. We have seen explicitly misogynistic terrorist acts – indeed, hatred of women is the through line that connects Isis to incels, that unites acts of violence globally – all while state-sponsored oppression of women has ascended to new levels of impunity. We have never needed unity more, yet, by wild coincidence, at exactly this moment, suddenly there is this obstacle that we can’t get past.It feels distinctly modern and unprecedented that we find ourselves in this obliterative debate, where one side can’t prevail until the other is destroyed, where all the values of the movement are parked so we can fight over issues that are so technical that there is no room for compromise, yet also so abstract that there is no space for human beings.In fact, there is precedent: we have weathered absolutes before. Are all men rapists? (But what about my son?) Is all sex servitude? (What if it was my idea?) Is lesbianism a political act? (What if I hate politics and would prefer to have a sexual destiny like anyone else?) None of this was settled in science. There was no definitive treaty that we all signed. We just decided slowly that binary debates are interesting to have, but boring to live. Solidarity is boring to talk about, but fascinating and empowering to live. Solidarity is not exclusive or pedantic it is compassionate and fights oppression where it finds it. That is its lifeblood. That is why trans women are women, or womxn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bca563c702aaa074654d2a694d94828afd12153b/152_160_4264_2558/master/4264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55e95777abcb40c87513a83fa0a4398b","title":"rachael blackmore finds gap and steers honeysuckle cheltenham","story":"Cheltenham’s favourite female jockey earned the applause after seeing off two Mullins horses to take the Mares HurdleTwo Gold Cup-winning jockeys got a lesson in tactics from Rachael Blackmore, who pinched the Mares Hurdle with a decisive move around the home bend on board Honeysuckle. Cheltenham’s favourite female jockey was delighted to get a winner on day one, having been the subject of very high expectations in recent days because of the quality of horse she now gets to ride.“Sometimes the ball bounces in your favour,” was Blackmore’s modest verdict in the winner’s enclosure. But she fully earned her luck with the patience she showed in tracking Stormy Ireland to the home turn, knowing things would open up in the straight. When that rival drifted away from the rail under Robbie Power, Blackmore and Honeysuckle were through in less time than it takes to describe, showing some of the pace that won them the Irish Champion Hurdle last month.Benie Des Dieux was a strong favourite, sent off at odds of 4-6 by a crowd convinced she was the better of these two classy mares. While that money was lost, many of her backers will take some convincing that their assessment was wrong considering the remorseless way Benie Des Dieux pounded up the hill, closing to within half a length at the line.The damage had been done on the approach to that bend when Paul Townend, who had been tracking Stormy Ireland, lost his faith that a gap would come and switched Benie Des Dieux out to be sure of a clear run. So often the result dictates interpretation it might have been hailed as a smart move if Benie Des Dieux had got home in front.Her trainer, Willie Mullins, was not happy with either Townend or Power, whose mount was also a Mullins runner. “I just think there was a miscommunication turning for home,” he told Racing TV. “Maybe Robbie thought one of our horses was behind him, rather than Honeysuckle. It looked like he just gifted the winner a huge gap, while Paul was going on the outside.“There you are. Things happen. Stormy probably didn’t go fast enough. She should have been going much faster to take the sting out of the rest of them. A little frustrated, but we’ve sound horses, sound jockeys, so hopefully we’ll get a turn at some stage.”Since Mullins came here as the most successful trainer in Festival history with 65 wins, it could be said he has already had plenty of turns. But this was not a successful start for the MullinsTownend combination in their first year since Ruby Walsh retired. Mullins saddled 10 runners, including three favourites, and did not make it to the winner’s enclosure.Working for ITV, Walsh evidently saw things the same way as his old boss. Analysing the replay, he said Townend should have nudged Stormy Ireland and Power back towards the rail before Honeysuckle had a chance to nip through. “That’s a saving of two lengths,” he said.Blackmore played down her part in the victory but made no secret of the pleasure it gave her. “I got some kick out of that,” she said before lavishing praise on her mount. “To be in the position I’m in, with the rides I have, is every jockey’s dream. I’m going to try to make the most of it.”The outcome was an echo of a now famous pony race, the thick end of 20 years ago, in which she beat Townend’s mount by a nose. Townend is still favourite to end the week as top jockey, at a slightly uneasy 3-1, but Blackmore is just a point bigger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff2ce2c60debbe6cfb34f2a2b3be3a55bfd3e06/0_267_5270_3163/master/5270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809a8b15856c641b27b34799936cb3a3","title":"talking horses chacun pour soi has the class to land champion chase cheltenham festival horse racing","story":"Crack Irish raider can put the smile back on Paul Townend’s face after a challenging first day at the Cheltenham FestivalAltior could not make the date but this Queen Mother Champion Chase still features a fascinating clash between two top-class animals. Defi Du Seuil has had an excellent season and his pace makes him a danger in any company but Chacun Pour Soi (3.30) looks enormously talented and can come out on top.That, after all, was what happened when they met at Punchestown last April and there is no clear reason why the form should not stand up. Chacun Pour Soi had four lengths in hand at the line that day, yet Defi Du Seuil ran well enough to dispel any thought he may have underperformed, with last year’s Arkle Chase winner, Duc des Genievres, 16 lengths further back in third. Chacun Pour Soi was last seen landing the Dublin Chase, comfortably besting Min, who had won the race for the previous two years. He can help put the smile back on Paul Townend’s face after a difficult opening day.1.30 Ballymore Hurdle Placed efforts on Tuesday by Abacadabras and Darver Star served to advertise the form of Envoi Allen, who beat them in the Royal Bond in December.

Dame De Compagnie, Franco De Port and Black Tears are all easy to like but Top Moon is one that could be overpriced, although the 33-1 was wiped off the boards during Tuesday afternoon. Joseph O’Brien’s charge had been strong at the finish in his races until last time, when racing prominently over two miles did not suit.4.10 Cross-Country Chase If he runs to the same level as last year, Tiger Roll will win easily but he is 10 and might still need this run on his way to the National. Easysland is a formidable opponent whose best days may yet be to come and he appeals at 3-1 in a race that lacks depth.4.50 Fred Winter Hurdle Few of these four-year-olds are going to thrive on this ground but Palladium should have no trouble on that score, having sluiced through Sandown’s mud twice already this year.

How can college and industries make it easier to afford college?”Musk, whose net worth is estimated at $34bn, responded by saying that college was unnecessary because “you can learn anything you want for free”.The main value of college, he said, is to be found in proving discipline by completing “annoying homework assignments” and in hanging around with people of the same age before entering the workforce.“I think college is basically for fun and to prove that you can do your chores, but they’re not for learning,” Musk said.He also said he hopes to make sure his electric car company Tesla does not have university requirements for jobs, “because that’s absurd”. The main requirement for employment at his companies, he said, is “exceptional ability”.“I don’t consider going to college evidence of exceptional ability,” Musk said. “In fact, ideally you dropped out.”Musk listed some “smart guys” who dropped out of college: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison. He also made his reference to Shakespeare, in fact the son of a glover who received a grammar school education but no more.When it comes to college dropouts, the three tech moguls cited by Musk are the exception not the rule. In the US, on average, a college degree brings $30,000 more in salary each year than a high school education.Musk in fact has two bachelor’s degrees, having attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated from the Wharton School – Donald Trump’s alma mater – in 1997.He did manage to drop out of his PhD program at Stanford, after two days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2954b079c934c170565c1d000debf1cfe61336/0_73_1944_1166/master/1944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb950dae004103f2c2c524f421b8215c","title":"democratic primaries live news biden sanders michigan 2020 winners","story":"Voters went to the polls in Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Michigan, Idaho and Washington state with the Vermont senator needing a boost’s Hallie Golden reports from Seattle, Washington:As initial results showed Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in a very tight race for Washington State delegates, Shaun Scott, Sanders’ local field director, alternated between watching results and saying encouraging remarks to election staff and volunteers.“We got this,” he said to a few of the people who had gathered at a bar in Seattle to watch the results on a large television screen.Scott highlighted the fact that election officials in Washington reported that 60,000 voters didn’t select a political party on their ballot, which could have invalidated those votes. He said the campaign team is prepared to go out this weekend and next to cure those ballots.“Yet another reason for people to check out installment number two of the Washington state primary,” he told the . “Episode one was a cliff hanger. But we think we’re going to come to a pretty definitive conclusion here in episode two.”Washington state is another example of how turnout often spikes when a caucus becomes a primary.In 2016, when Washington held caucuses, roughly 230,000 people participated. (Bernie Sanders won that race by about 45 points.)In comparison, more than a million votes have already been counted tonight in the state’s primary, with Sanders and Joe Biden running neck and neck.Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are neck and neck in Washington state, where 89 pledged delegates are up for grabs.Considering the narrow margin and Washington’s high rates of mail-in voting, it may take days to know the winner:Even though a number of Bernie Sanders’ allies insist the race for the nomination is not over, some progressive groups are already looking ahead to November after their preferred candidate’s disappointing performance tonight.The political director of the group CPD Action, which endorsed Sanders in December, said the Vermont senator “has proven that his voice and his movement are vital to any success in November.”“We are committed to the Bernie Sanders campaign and the values that it represents,” Natalia Salgado added in the statement. “We will continue to push this agenda forward in the primaries, the general and beyond. Our North Star is to defeat Donald Trump and we are prepared to do what it takes.”Adam Green -- the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which initially endorsed Elizabeth Warren -- said Sanders and Joe Biden should still debate on Sunday.“Not because it will likely change the outcome, but because in order to not change the outcome Biden has to withstand one-on-one scrutiny similar to a debate with Trump,” Green told the .All of this indicates that progressive groups have little hope of Sanders turning back the tide of momentum that appears to be carrying Biden to the nomination.As Joe Biden looks ahead to the general election, Bernie Sanders’ allies are sending a very different message: this race is far from over.From congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, one of Sanders’ top surrogates:But congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another top Sanders surrogate, acknowledged on Instagram that this was a “tough night electorally”.Joe Biden won praise for his remarks tonight in Philadelphia, which felt like the victory speech of a presumptive nominee.The candidate spoke to a small group after having to cancel his Cleveland rally due to coronavirus. and he commended Bernie Sanders’ supporters for “their tireless energy and their passion.”Joe Biden’s staffers in Philadelphia, where the candidate just spoke, are celebrating like this race is over.Biden has already won three primaries tonight – Mississippi, Missouri and the key state of Michigan.The former vice-president is also currently running even with Sanders in Washington state’s primary, while Sanders won Washington’s 2016 caucuses in a landslide.Bernie Sanders’ campaign said that he still intends to participate in Sunday’s debate against Joe Biden, although the candidate will not speak tonight.Sanders is already facing some calls to drop out of the race and allow Democrats to focus on the general election against Trump after his disappointing performance tonight.Speaking at a Philadelphia event tonight, Biden himself appeared to be pivoting to the general election, thanking Sanders’ supporters for their “tireless energy” and saying they would work together to defeat Trump.However, Sanders seems unlikely to drop out anytime soon, considering he kept his 2016 campaign going until shortly before the party’s nominating convention.It is 11 pm ET, so polls have now closed in Idaho and Washington state, the last two states holding primaries tonight.Bernie Sanders won both states in landslides in 2016, but that was when they held caucuses, rather than the primaries they held today.Sanders has consistently performed better in caucuses, so the new voting system could put him at a disadvantage.Joe Biden is addressing a small group at an event in Philadelphia after his strong primary performance tonight.Sounding very much like a presidential nominee, Biden warned that another four years of Trump’s policies would do irreparable damage to the country.“Donald Trump’s ‘America First’ policy made America alone,” Biden said of the president’s foreign policy.The former vice-president used the setting of the speech, Philadelphia’s National Constitution Center, to extoll the virtues of American government. “Our very democracy is at stake in this election,” Biden said, repeating his common campaign line that America is in a “battle for the soul of this nation”.“There’s not a single thing we cannot do if we do it together,” Biden said.Joe Biden has taken the podium at his Philadelphia event, addressing a small group after already securing three primary wins tonight.“Although there’s a way to go, it looks like we’re going to have another good night,” Biden said.The former vice president then appeared to pivot to the general election, applauding Bernie Sanders’ supporters for “their tireless energy and their passion.”“We share a common goal, and together we’ll defeat Donald Trump,” Biden said. “We’re going to bring this nation together.”The unity push sent a clear message that the Biden camp considers the nominating contest to be all but over.’s Hallie Golden reports from Washington state:A small handful of Bernie Sanders campaign staff and volunteers sat around talking, playing pool and watching presidential election results on a large television tuned to CNN in a bar in Seattle.The unofficial gathering was organized last minute after a primary-night event that was expected to see as many as 400 people was canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak.Shaun Scott, Sanders’ field director in Washington, told the  that they made sure not to advertise the event or even post about it on social media because of the concern with bringing large groups of people together in a state at the center of this outbreak. “We want to make sure that at the same time that we want to celebrate all the work that we’ve done up to this point and through the March 10th primary, that we’re not endangering people’s health frankly,” he said. Health officials in King County, which includes Seattle, have recommended that everyone should avoid crowds and being in large groups of people in spaces that are poorly ventilated. As of Tuesday, the state has 162 confirmed cases of coronavirus across eight counties, including 22 deaths.Joe Biden’s campaign has also opted not to hold any primary night events in Washington, and has focused on engaging voters remotely, including through virtual phone banking and tele town halls.Bernie Sanders’ campaign has announced the presidential candidate will not speak tonight after losing the key state of Michigan to Joe Biden.Sanders traveled back to his home state of Vermont tonight after having to cancel his rally in Cleveland, Ohio, due to concerns about coronavirus.Although Sanders will not address supporters or the press tonight, the candidate is already facing calls to drop out, as some Democratic strategists declare Biden to be the presumptive nominee.Sanders will likely win some of Mississippi’s district-level delegates regardless, but if he cannot grab any statewide delegates there, it will be another bad headline for him on a generally disappointing night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6800dd8c4e30a950d1bff2bba3d2551a55349b8/0_147_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94d54ddc32810551dc0fe91e887d8dc3","title":"democratic primary results mini tuesday votes live michigan washington missouri states tracker","story":"Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota and Washington state will select their Democratic candidate, with the first polls closing at 8pm ETThere are 20 pledged delegates available in Idaho’s Democratic presidential primary vote, where infrastructure, healthcare and the economy rank among the issues voters care most about.

Focus will now fall on tracking down and testing the potentially hundreds of people Dorries will have been in contact with in the past week, both in parliament and at the health department.She also attended a Downing Street reception last week for International Women’s Day where the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, were among guests present.A DHSC spokeswoman said Dorries, who began her career as a nurse, has been self-isolating at home since Friday. She is understood to be recovering.In a statement released by the department, she said: “I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus. As soon as I was informed I took all the advised precautions and have been self-isolating at home.“Public Health England has started detailed contact tracing and the department and my parliamentary office are closely following their advice. I would like to thank PHE and the wonderful NHS staff who have provided me with advice and support.”After the news was announced she tweeted:Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tweeted: “Really sorry to hear Nadine has tested positive for coronavirus. She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE staff have been brilliant. We all wish her well as she recovers.”There has been speculation that parliament could be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus among MPs, peers and staff, but Downing Street has as yet played down this idea.A spokesman said there were still no plans to suspend parliament to prevent the spread of the virus. “We are closely following guidance from Public Health England (PHE) in response to the situation and have been reassured that the measures we are taking are proportionate and appropriate,” he said.“At present there are no plans to suspend parliament. Changes to the way parliament functions would be a matter for consultation between the Speakers, the government and the parliamentary authorities.”A government source told PA Media that officials and MPs should continue to go to work in Whitehall and parliament unless told otherwise, saying chief medical officer advice was that “no one needs to self-isolate or be tested unless asked to by the PHE contact tracers who are working round the clock”.There was no immediate response to Dorries’ diagnosis from No 10."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c105c6ee4159064c2468358128c985d7b5be456e/0_52_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178df4345af844fd670f358b2c045957","title":"pressure builds on uk to step up coronavirus measures","story":"Travellers returning to UK from Italy told no need to isolate as sixth death announcedDowning Street has admitted the NHS 111 online service has been giving out the wrong advice on coronavirus to travellers returning from Italy, as the number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 373 and a sixth death was announced.Returning travellers from the European centre of the outbreak in Italy were still being told all day on Tuesday there was no need to self-isolate if they had no symptoms.This is despite advice from Public Health England released on Monday night advising all people coming from Italy, which is in lockdown, to stay at home for 14 days regardless of whether they feel unwell.Confused travellers expressed their concerns about the conflicting advice on social media but NHS 111 still had not updated the portal at 5pm on Tuesday – hours after it was first informed of the problem.A No 10 spokesman defended the government’s handling of its advice to citizens, saying: “They are aware of the problem and that information is being urgently updated. Obviously, we have been setting out very clearly in public what the advice is in relation to Italy. But I am aware of the issue and it is being urgently resolved.”An NHS 111 spokesperson said: “NHS Digital update the 111 algorithms once they are notified by government, and as soon as each update has been tested prior to release.” Elisabeth Braw, a resilience expert at the Royal United Services (RUSI) thinktank, said: “It’s really in everybody’s interests that all of the government channels for information says the same thing. Otherwise there may be confusion.“But really there a fundamental problem in that the UK has not focused on preparedness among the public. The government may consider itself to be prepared but it’s not the case that the public is. Otherwise you end up with frantic last-minute efforts and the public are stockpiling toilet paper and other resources.”A sizeable proportion of the UK’s 382 coronavirus cases have originated in Italy, with thousands of people returning from holidays in the country in recent weeks.Ryanair has followed British Airways and other airlines in reducing the number of flights to and from the country.The government said those arriving at Heathrow from Italy who were not easily able to self-isolate were being asked if they wanted to enter quarantine at a large hotel near the airport.The venue is understood to be a Holiday Inn that has been used for some people arriving from China and South Korea in recent weeks. No 10 said some people thought to be at particular risk were being offered transport to their homes.However, people returning from Italy were not given information on self-isolation as they landed and were largely free to travel home via public transport if they wished, even though they were supposed to self-isolate for 14 days even if they did not have symptoms.It is not known whether they were being offered face masks for the journey and it was also unclear what the procedures were for people returning via other airports.European states have been announcing increasingly strict measures to try to stem the spread of the virus. Austria announced a ban on Italians entering the country unless they were carrying a medical certificate, while Spain has said it is preparing for school closures from Wednesday.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The sixth death happened on Monday night at Watford General hospital, part of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust. The patient was in their 80s and had underlying health conditions.On Tuesday, MPs were told the government could suspend various elements of bureaucracy for GPs to allow them to focus more immediately on treating patients.In other developments on Tuesday:Earlier on Tuesday, the deputy chief medical officer for England defended the government’s strategy of holding off on cancelling major outdoor events such as football matches and closing schools.Speaking as tens of thousands of people attended the opening day of the Cheltenham festival, Dr Jenny Harries said the argument for cancelling major events was not necessarily supported by science, adding: “The virus will not survive very long outside.”New measures including those aimed at protecting older or vulnerable people are expected to be put into action soon, possibly after a meeting of the government’s Cobra emergency committee on Wednesday.Boris Johnson discussed the situation with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, on Tuesday morning, while experts from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) convened to analyse the latest figures on spread. Among those calling for a change of tactics soon was Dr Peter Drobac, an expert in infectious diseases at Oxford University, who told the BBC he believed it was time to seriously consider some of the social distancing adopted by other countries, including closing schools.“The evidence we have suggests that social distancing works best before the surge in cases rather than after,” said Drobac, adding that with hindsight it appeared Italy had waited too long before implementing such measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc6e7e72f7eddfa56e93d82bf4edf46d409fe0b/0_0_5485_3290/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f808a6dab84f8723f1c4f368fa94b5b","title":"us taliban deal frank mckenzie afghanistan","story":"Marine Gen Frank McKenzie gave evidence to Congress on Tuesday, hours after US forces began pulling out of AfghanistanThe US commander for the Middle East and Afghanistan has said the Taliban are not keeping “their part of the bargain” from the deal signed with the US earlier this month, saying the insurgents were continuing to launch attacks.Marine Gen Frank McKenzie was giving evidence to Congress on Tuesday, hours after US forces began pulling out of Afghanistan as agreed in the 29 February deal, and as talks between Taliban and government representatives were due to begin.“The Taliban need to keep their part of the bargain, and they are continuing attacks,” McKenzie, the head of US Central Command, said. “They are not directed against coalition forces, they are not occurring in city centers, they are occurring at isolated checkpoints. But those attacks are occurring, and they’re not consistent with a movement toward a negotiated settlement, and they’re not consistent with the undertaking they made.”The US-Taliban deal followed a week-long partial ceasefire, but it did not include an agreement to continue that ceasefire. Trump administration officials have said that the withdrawal of the 13,000-strong US military presence in Afghanistan, due to happen over 14 months, would be “conditions-based”.“We’re going to go to 8,600 by the summer,” McKenzie said. “Conditions on the ground will dictate if we go below that. If conditions on the ground are not permissive, my advice would not be to continue that reduction.”US officials have not spelled out the conditions for the US withdrawal to continue, leaving the Trump administration much room for manoeuvre in interpreting success.A secret annexe to the agreement signed in Doha reportedly lists the sort of attacks that are prohibited during that period, including assaults on the retreating US troops. The annexe has been shown to members of Congress but not to the public.The UN security council expressed its unanimous backing from the US-Taliban deal on Tuesday and called for intra-Afghan peace talks, which the council said “must protect the rights of all Afghans, including women, youth and minorities”.In a highly sceptical assessment of the agreement, McKenzie told a House committee he was not optimistic about the Taliban severing ties with al-Qaida.“We need to observe what they do and we have the capability to do that … That has not yet been demonstrated,” he said.But, the general added: “We’re going to have ample time to see if they actually do that … And that will be before we become irrevocably committed to a force presence that would not allow us to have adequate leverage.”The chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, later presented a rosier assessment of the Taliban compliance with the Doha agreement.“Although there are ups and downs, it has somewhat been holding,” Hoffman said.Prospective talks between Taliban and government representatives, due to start this week, have been complicated over a continuing dispute over the result of last year’s presidential election.The incumbent president, Ashraf Ghani, issued a decree on Tuesday night on prisoner releases, which has been a major obstacle to starting intra-Afghan talks. According to Ghani’s spokesman, the government will release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in stages, starting with 1,500 on Saturday and then 500 every two weeks as negotiations progress.The swap involving up to 5,000 Taliban fighters was agreed by the US, which does not hold Taliban prisoners. They are being held by the Afghan government, which has been reluctant to free prisoners of war before negotiations begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dea0acc27703786cc53a64a199680edd849cb1c7/0_51_4110_2466/master/4110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87f5f1ad92e013d5d6e14b596225f66","title":"vladimir putin amendment power russia 2024","story":"Current term limit for Putin, who has ruled for 20 years, expires in 2024Vladimir Putin has moved to cement his hold on power in Russia beyond the middle of the decade, backing a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The Russian president is required by the constitution to step down in 2024, and there have been months of conjecture about how he could stay in power beyond then, or at least ensure a safe transition for himself.In the end, the puzzle was resolved in an afternoon, in a series of choreographed political steps that took just over three hours and could result in Putin staying on as president until 2036.The venture began in parliament, where a member of Russia’s ruling party proposed amending the constitution in a way that would “reset” Putin’s presidential term count back to zero.Putin then announced he would come to address the parliament himself, prompting breathless coverage on state television about whether he would accept or turn down the proposal. “In principle, this option would be possible,” he said at the end of a half-hour speech. “But on one condition – if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution.”He also said the move would have to be approved by the public in a referendum next month.It was a significant, if not surprising, about-face for the president, who has been signalling publicly in recent months that he could leave the presidency. In January, he told a veteran of the second world war that he was worried about a return to the 80s, when Kremlin leaders “stayed in power until the end of their days” and did not provide for a transition of power.On Tuesday, he walked back that statement, saying that modern Russia’s elections made it impossible to return to a Soviet-style procession of leaders-for-life. “I won’t hide that I was wrong,” he said. “It was an incorrect statement because during the Soviet Union there were no elections.”Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Ironically, the amendment piggybacks on plans to change the constitution to prevent anyone from serving more than two terms as president in total. The amendment says that the new rule would not count any presidential terms already served. In reality, the amendment affects only two living Russians, Putin and the former prime minister Dmitry Medvedev.Russia’s opposition, including Putin’s most prominent critic, Alexei Navalny, denounced the proposals as an effort to make him “president for life”. “Interesting how things turn out,” Navalny said in a tweet after Putin’s speech.Supporters of Putin said the amendment would prevent instability and avoid his being made a lame duck in his last term. “No one is saying that the amendments being proposed today are for Vladimir Putin,” said Alexander Khinshtein, a member of the ruling United Russia party, on state television. He also noted that Putin had not said he would necessarily run in 2024. “But the head of state should have that ability to maintain stability in society.”Valentina Tereshkova, an MP who as a Soviet cosmonaut became the first woman to fly to space, proposed the amendment as part of a series of constitutional changes going to a nationwide vote on 22 April.With Putin’s backing, there is little doubt the measure will pass. Support from the constitutional court is likely to be a rubber stamp. Less than an hour after Putin’s address to lawmakers, parliament approved the amendment as part of a wider revision of Russia’s constitution.The 67-year-old, in power for 20 years, is Russia’s longest-serving leader since Stalin. If he serves out both terms from 2024 he will surpass the Soviet dictator.The decision comes after a months-long effort to revise Russia’s constitution announced in January by Putin. Before Tuesday, some observers believed he was seeking another seat in government to maintain power and ensure his personal safety after leaving the presidency.It is unclear whether Putin had planned to stay on as president all along or had come to the decision more recently.In his speech, he said he hoped that one day the institution of the presidency in Russia would not be “so personified in a single person”, but added: “that is how all of our history ended up and of course we can’t not take that into account”.On the subject of whether he would actually run again in 2024, Putin told lawmakers: “I’m sure that we will do many great things together, at least before 2024. Then we’ll see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/356521ba626070175b07c8486da13853078148da/0_171_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89f2a4d3a7448dadb4b6f7de81b7f41","title":"were a bit shocked italians on life under coronavirus lockdown","story":"From Milan to Palermo in Sicily, few people are even venturing out for a coffee in the local barBar Il Sant’Andrea is something of a barometer for the liveliness of Orvieto, a hilltop town of about 4,000 people in Italy’s central Umbria region. On a typical morning, it would be buzzing with customers having coffee, chatting or reading the newspapers.On Tuesday, however, as news that the whole of Italy was to be put under lockdown sunk in, only a handful of regulars called in. “Think about it this way,” said the barman, Francesco Maggi. “On Sunday, five of us were working. Today, there is only one.”The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told 60 million Italians late on Monday to “stay at home” as the government introduced measures unprecedented in peacetime to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of the coronavirus.Conte’s message is starting to reverberate. The hashtag #iostoacasa – I stay at home – accompanied by images of home-cooked meals or a good book, has been shared by thousands on social media.In Orvieto, a town heavily dependent on tourism, bars and shops were already laying down duct tape to ensure customers stand at least a metre apart before Monday night’s announcement.The mood on Tuesday morning was sombre but, unlike in other places across Italy, there was no sense of panic. People were walking around, some wearing masks or with scarves wrapped around their mouths. “People are definitely taking it more seriously,” said Federico Badia, a shoemaker. “They are staying home and only going out if necessary. But I am very worried about the future of a little town like Orvieto, as most of the businesses survive on tourism. If the season doesn’t start in a month or so, I don’t think we’ll be having a season at all.”Other inhabitants were perplexed by the quarantine rules. “It is very confusing,” said Toni DeBella, a US resident. “You have to stay home, but you can go to a bar. Transportation is running, but you’re not supposed to go anywhere.”Under the quarantine regulations all forms of public gathering, include sporting events, have been banned, as have weddings and funerals. Theatres, cinemas, museums, gyms, spas and ski resorts have been closed. Only bars and restaurants can open, but only between 6am and 6pm. Travel is to be avoided unless it is for “urgent, verifiable work situations and emergencies health reasons”.“This is not an armoured shutdown like in China,” said Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister and the leader of Italia Viva, one of the parties that makes up the government majority. “There is space for movement for people who have urgent needs. We need to reduce the contagion to a minimum, not only because of the death rate but also because the impact on the health system is colossal. Intensive care units are filling up and if you have a stroke or heart attack, you can’t be treated.”Life in major cities, including Rome, Milan and Venice, has come to a standstill. “You can really see the difference in Rome today compared to yesterday,” said Sabina Colombo, a consultant who works from home. “It is very quiet. If I go out I wear plastic gloves, I couldn’t find a face mask anywhere.“In this type of situation there has to be a sense of civic responsibility and punishments for people who don’t respect the rules … those who do break them don’t care about the elderly dying, or those with cancer and low immunity.”Kelly Medford, a US artist living in Rome, said: “There has definitely been a change of mood over the last 24 hours. I think we’re all a little bit shocked as it really hits home just how dire the situation is.”In southern Italy, the region of Campania had the highest number of coronavirus cases as of Monday with 126, followed by Sicily with 60. Shortly after news of the lockdown broke, hundreds of people poured into one of the few supermarkets in the Sicilian capital of Palermo that is open 24 hours.By Tuesday morning, the streets of the city were mostly silent, apart from the hubbub at supermarkets and chemists as people joined long queues to buy essentials such as water, pasta and disinfectant.Stress, confusion and anxiety about the virus and the new rules was palpable. “I wore a face mask for the first time this morning, and saw other people wearing them too,” said Federica Montalba, an education coordinator. “What we saw on TV yesterday has arrived here today.“I’m not afraid of catching the virus, but I’m afraid of passing it on to my family who live an hour from here. I haven’t visited them since the first case was recorded in Palermo. What worries me most are people and their ignorance. Some people have not yet understood that we are facing an emergency and continue to act as if nothing has happened.”As the number of coronavirus cases across Italy continues to rise, Simona D’Alessi, a doctor at Palermo’s Benfratelli hospital, said there was a risk of “very high” contagion in hospitals.“We are running out of masks and gloves. People keep coming to the emergency room. Doctors can’t take holidays, because there’s an emergency and people need us, but I don’t know how long we can go on like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f24eaf03b56b1968708b9fa2d176242087e8dc4/0_116_3725_2235/master/3725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588367c98ff5915838992be56cfdccc6","title":"what does prospect perpetual putin mean russia future","story":"President’s plan to remain in power beyond 2024 does not bode well either for Russia or the worldThe idea that Vladimir Putin would quietly retire always seemed fanciful, given the grisly fate that often befalls ageing autocrats, ex-dictators and even supposedly elected presidents once they let go of absolute power.In January, Russia’s president-in-perpetuity floated a range of possible constitutional “reforms” to help decide what happens in 2024 when his term in office expires.This was, in theory, a public consultation. Maybe the Duma, Russia’s parliament, should have more powers, Putin suggested. Perhaps the role of the prime minister, or the state council, should be enhanced?When Putin fired his top toady, the unpopular Dmitri Medvedev – and the entire government – at a stroke, it seemed he meant business. It was a lethal move straight out of Ivan the Terrible’s old Kremlin playbook.The upheaval sparked earnest talk about the future of Putinism, the “power vertical” and the post-Putin era. For a minute or two, it sounded like a real debate. Perhaps democracy in Russia was not dead after all.Big misunderstanding. Political analysts at home and abroad thought they were talking about future governance and how to manage the succession when Putin’s unbroken quarter century in power concluded.Putin, however, was talking about what, for him, is the most pressing question of the day: how to keep power forever. On Tuesday, he gave his answer, in effect: “Forget all the other stuff, I’m staying.”It’s strange others did not think of it first. Putin’s brilliant wheeze – turning the presidential clock back to zero – means he and all of Russia can look forward to another two terms. Problem solved. Debate over. Putin was careful to tell the Duma, apparently in all sincerity, that term limits must be respected and the constitution honoured. Future elections in which he took part would be “naturally open and competitive”.If such smirking double-speak leaves observers confounded, imagine how Alexei Navalny and other persecuted opposition activists who have spent their lives fighting for free and fair elections must be feeling.Putin also reassured his adoring Duma fans that his personal Doomsday clock, permanently set at five minutes to midnight, would be put to a referendum next month.It’s true Putin is not as popular as he once was. The economy is a mess. The oil price war will make it worse. Corruption is out of control. But Putin has ways of winning even when he’s losing. It’s a safe bet the referendum will work out OK for him.What does the prospect of perpetual Putin mean for the future? At home, more croneyism, more repression, more national stagnation, more grand larceny by his magic circle of crooks and charlatans.Abroad, more disruption to the international order, more anti-western agitation and subversion, more rightwing populist poison, and more sniggering and bragging about liberalism’s obsolescence.Putin already has Donald Trump in the bag, so to speak, secretly beholden to him for reasons still unexplained. If Trump wins a second term, there’s no end to the trouble the two of them may cause.Joe Biden, as Barack Obama’s vice-president, also tried to reset the Russian clock, but in a different way. It didn’t work then. And Biden is unlikely to have better luck now, even if he gets the chance.In Europe, Angela Merkel battled Putin over Crimea and Ukraine and got nowhere. Now she’s on her way out. Boris Johnson is no match, and France’s Emmanuel Macron could be writing his memoirs by the time 2024 comes around.Among other world leaders, only China’s Xi Jinping, another self-proclaimed president-for-life, may still be around when Putin’s starts the clock ticking again. And for all their differences, Xi and Putin share one big aim of reducing western power.Putin’s 2024 CV reads like a roll-call of 21st-century woes: endless strife in contested countries such as Syria, Libya and Ukraine, a UN system mired in endless stalemate, nationalist delusions peddled, elections fiddled, opponents assassinated, wealth stolen and democracy in retreat.Putin survives through the ruthless exercise of power, spurred by malign intent, greed and personal spite. He will not name a successor, for he can never retire. He has too many enemies to ever rest easy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

Photograph: Alex WelshThe New York TimesAre you washing your hands correctly? While most Irish people have become much more focused when it comes to hand hygiene in recent days as fears over the impact of coronavirus have grown, a leading virologist at Trinity College Dublin has warned that the techniques employed by many are still wrong and could leave viruses on hands and fingernails.Using UV lights and a reflective cream to mimic the spread of a virus, the leader of the virology research group at Trinity, Dr Kim Roberts, was able to show just how hard it can be to clean human hands effectively.When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of the Covid-19.Dr Roberts demonstrated how quick hand-washes were utterly useless and only served to spread the virus to arms and clothes, while even a relatively vigorous handwashing was only partially effective.She reminded people that not only do they need to wash their hands “for a minimum of 20 seconds”, they also need to allow soap to do its work before rinsing hands in water.FingernailsShe highlighted the need to ensure all parts of the hands including fingernails were washed with equal vigour.The HSE, the Department of Health and all medical experts have been reinforcing the need for people to take greater care with hand hygiene in order to curtail – in so far as is possible – the spread of coronavirus.The results of a huge study in 2015, and published in the Lancet, proved the importance of hand washing to prevent the mass spread of an illness such as coronavirus.Researchers at the University of Southampton randomly ided more than 20,000 people from GP lists into two groups, one of which was invited to visit a website designed to encourage people to wash their hands, while the other group didn’t get access.While effects weren’t huge, with 10-20 per cent reductions in infections and consultations among the former group, these small effects extrapolated to population level would produce huge benefits from a cheap and easily accessed intervention.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4198728.1583846509!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus i have never washed my hands as much in my life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Panic is not going to help anybody,’ says Dr Joe McEvoy, one of two doctors at Bayview Medical in Derry. Photograph: Freya McClements A large bottle of hand sanitiser sits on the counter at Bayview Medical Centre in Derry.It has always been there, explains receptionist Sharon McGonagle, but in the last week they have gone through two bottles. “Every patient who walks through those doors is using the hand sanitiser.”As The  enters, a patient squirts it onto her palms when she leaves, she pushes the door open using her elbows, rather than her hands. “We’ve even had some patients come to pick up prescriptions wearing blue surgical gloves.”So far, 12 cases of coronavirus – also known as Covid-19 – have been confirmed in the North, and 24 in the Republic. “In the waiting room, everyone’s talking about it,” adds McGonagle.Among them is Marie Hutton. “I have never washed my hands as much in my life,” she tells The . “I’m really panicking.” Her husband is on a high dose of immunosuppressants as such, he is regarded as particularly at risk. “I’ve been washing my hands so much they were nearly cut, and I had to use hand cream. If you had any cuts the virus could get in that way too,” she explains.She has been glued to the television, watching for every piece of information, but still she has questions. “I’m supposed to be flying to Manchester on Friday, but now I don’t know whether I should go or not.” When she was out shopping she bought an extra packet of cornflakes, “just in case”.“I’m not worried about it myself,” she emphasises. “It’s my husband.” Beside her, 80-year-old Anne Clifford explains she is also taking precautions. “If I’ve been out, as soon as I come in I wash my hands.”Otherwise, she is unconcerned. “When you get to my age, something’s going to take you.”It is all “hype”, says Harry Doherty the cancellation of St Patrick’s Day parades, he believes, is “unnecessary”.“It doesn’t affect me,” adds Shane McElhinney. “My only concern would be bringing it back to a sick person.” The government, he says, are “piling it on, making us freak out.” He and another patient discuss the fall in oil prices. “If you had a spare tank it would be handy, to stock up,” says Thomas Campbell.“There has to be all this hype,” says Lily Kelly, “so that if it doesn’t turn out to be that big, they can say this is what we did to stop it.”In the surgery, signs of preparation are everywhere. On the front door a notice from the Public Health Agency (PHA) is prominently displayed. “Catch it, bin it, kill it,” it reads.An isolation room has been prepared, just in case it smells overwhelmingly of alcohol-based cleaning products.In Northern Ireland, the advice from the Public Health Agency is to phone your GP if you are concerned you have the symptoms of coronavirus. At Bayview, McGonagle and her colleague, Jodie Spence, answer the calls they do not make a diagnosis, but talk through a flow chart of symptoms with callers and ask about their recent travel. If they believe a patient could have coronavirus, they advise them to go home and call the PHA 111 helpline, where they can arrange for testing.“In the last couple of days, there has been an escalation of calls,” says McGonagle. “This morning we had three or four calls first thing, as soon as the phone opened,” adds Spence. “People were ringing saying they thought they had coronavirus.”They believe the media coverage of the virus has played a part in this, as has the increased number of cases in Ireland. “People are now thinking maybe they could have it.”The message from the authorities seems to be getting through so far nobody has come to the surgery complaining of symptoms. In the waiting room, everyone knows what to do. “Stay at home, and phone your GP,” emphasises Campbell.To their doctor, this attitude is reassuring. “Panic is not going to help anybody, so it’s actually quite wise,” says Dr Joe McEvoy, one of two doctors at Bayview Medical.“From the population’s point of view, you do what you can and if it happens it happens, but when you’re looking at it from this side of the desk where we have 4,000 patients and two doctors, we’re thinking, how are we going to cope even a moderate rise in people with respiratory infections?”He has “no doubt” Covid-19 will spread, and his practice will be faced with sufferers he has stopped shaking hands with patients, though notes that patients are also avoiding this themselves.One concern is the “sheer numbers involved, and trying to get them tested appropriately”. Advice can be conflicting at the same time, the surgery is trying to deal with routine illnesses, condition and the end of the winter flu season.“The long-term factor,” he points out, “is that there are so few doctors, particularly GPs. Numbers have fallen over the past few years, and I think the number of nurses, the number of health professionals, the number of hospital beds being reduced has prepared the ground in a very bad way for a potential problem here.“At the moment,” he says, “we’re saying, what can we do to try and prepare for this and deal with it as best we can?

Jacuzzis or other types of spa pools may need a higher amount, for example.Of all the organisms that threaten the purity of water supplies and swimming pools, cryptosporidium requires the highest dose of chlorine to be inactivated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos important to bring a Traveller voice to the table,\u0026rsquo says activist Eileen FlynnVaradkar and Martin look to Greens to join them as coronavirus weighs on StateEfforts renewed for Australia\u0026rsquos unused US visa allowance to be given to IrelandThe view from a doctor\u0026rsquos surgery: Patients are ringing in if they have symptomsMeasures to tackle excessive pay to richest, and to increase wages of lowest paid neededCollision happened shortly after Centra store robbed by a number of malesSchool closures and actions outlined by undertakers labelled not yet \u0026lsquounnecessary\u0026rsquoBryan O\u0026rsquoBrien wins UKPEG award for \u0026lsquoWhen Orangemen Cross the Border\u0026rsquo videoSome legal professionals express frustration at the lack of information on proposalsRyanair says people looking to be repatriated can move to an earlier flight for freeRepublic has total of 34 reported cases as Irish airlines suspend flights to ItalyObjections from existing residents and city councillors halt plans at four sitesSupport groups say overcrowding in asylum system makes self-isolation impossibleChief Medical Officer says no evidence yet seen of community transmission of virusSt James\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoreminds\u0026rsquo workers of risk to patients over \u0026lsquounauthorised removal\u0026rsquo of masksBrigid McManus appointed to carry out independent assessment of governanceGovernment urged to lift curbs on recruiting healthcare assistants from outside EUNew trucks will replace the current fleet that entered service between 1998 and 2003People and wildlife at risk from greater heat, sea level rises and extreme weatherStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199178.1583875821!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus biggest daily increase as 10 new cases confirmed","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and other EU leaders have agreed for funding to help develop new tests, new treatments and a vaccine  for coronavirus as rapidly as possible.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, during a media update on the confirmed case of coronavirus at Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTen new cases of coronavirus have been reported this evening, the biggest daily increase recorded since the disease was found here at the end of February.The new cases bring the total number in the Republic to 34 another four cases were reported in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, bringing its total to 16.Five of the new cases relate to travel from an affected area, two related to hospital transmission or possible hospital transmission, and three are associated with close contact with a confirmed case.The new cases involve six males and four females. Five of the cases were in the south of the country, three in the east and two in the west.There has also been a massive increase in the number of people being tested, up to 1,784 from 297 a week ago.Asked whether schools would be closed to curb the spread of the virus, the State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said such a measure could be deployed “at some point in time” depending on what happened, “but that time is not necessarily now”.Blanket restrictions in place on visiting at nursing homes and some hospitals, aimed at curbing the risk of infection, should be lifted, Dr Holohan said.Dr Holohan said visitor restrictions – which were introduced in private nursing homes across the State earlier this week – had a major impact on residents, for whom social interaction was a key part of wellbeing.While restrictions might be necessary in a particular nursing home depending on circumstances, Dr Holohan said there was no case for across-the-board restrictions. “We want to avoid introducing measures before they are really necessary,” he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NEPHT), at a meeting on Tuesday, declared that “socially restrictive actions” around hospitals and nursing homes were “not necessary at this moment in time”, according to a statement issued later.Public health officials also described the measures recommended by undertakers, including the immediate cremation of deceased people in body-bags, as “unnecessary”.Detailed guidelines on the handling of deceased people who have coronavirus also known as Covid-19 are to be published on Wednesday. It will be evident from these that the measures proposed by the Irish Association of Funeral Directors are not necessary, Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said.The officials said people should be encouraged to follow respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene procedures in order to protect vulnerable groups, including older people and patients with underlying conditions. People should not visit if they themselves are unwell.Earlier, details emerged of the four new cases of Covid-19 detected in Northern Ireland. All four are adults. One case involved recent travel from Northern Italy. Three can be traced to a previously reported case that involved recent travel to Northern Italy.The annual St Patrick’s reception in Washington DC, hosted by the Irish Ambassador to the United States, has been cancelled. However, a meeting between US president Donald Trump and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will go ahead.On Tuesday afternoon, Ryanair and Aer Lingus said they were suspending all flights to and from and within Italy following the decision of the Italian government to lock down the entire country to contain the spread of coronavirus.Ryanair said the suspension of internal flights would come into force at midnight.Flights into and out of Italy will be suspended at midnight on Friday, March 13th. The measures will be in place until April 8th.Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights to and from Italy from Wednesday, March 11th, until April 3rd.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said residents of Ireland should not travel to Italy unless it is absolutely necessary.Minister for Business Heather Humphreys has meanwhile cancelled her St Patrick’s Day trip to the US west coast.Ms Humphreys told Northern Sound radio she needed to remain in Ireland to deal with the effects of the viral outbreak on businesses.On Monday evening, three newly discovered cases of coronavirus were reported on Monday evening in the Republic. Those cases included females from the west and south of the country who had been in close contact with prior cases and a female healthcare worker from the south who was in close contact with a patient.The movements of Italy’s population of 60 million is being severely limited after the lockdown area was extended to the whole of Italy last night, not just the most severely affected areas of the north.On Monday night, Italy’s death toll from the virus jumped by 97 to 463.Italy has moved to temporarily suspend the payments of bills, taxes and mortgages to ease pressure on small firms and households.Mr Coveney said while the Government can advise Irish citizens not to travel to Italy, “we cannot control a country in lockdown”, and could not stop Italian citizens from travelling to Ireland.Worldwide, the number of Covid-19 cases has surpassed 110,000, in 105 countries. There have been 3,817 deaths.The EU’s disease prevention agency is set to tighten its advice as evidence emerged that people showing no symptoms could spread the virus.EU leaders will hold an emergency conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a response to the deadly virus.Also on Tuesday, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Government was open to implementing difficult decisions, including closing down schools and universities.Apple has sent a number of employees to self-isolate following a confirmed case in its Cork office. Lectures at Trinity College Dublin will be suspended from tomorrow.Irish responseAll St Patrick’s Day parades across the State were cancelled on Monday in a bid to curtail the spread of the virus.Mr Coveney said while Ireland remains in the containment phase, it was inevitable the country would move into the delay phase as more cases emerged.Because there is no vaccine and no treatment, the only way of limiting the spread is through good public community care and health care, he said.“We are trying to provide responses that are proportionate. We are trying to follow public health advice. We need to listen to the experts and the advice they give.”The Government was not ruling out any course of action, he said. If the virus starts to spread in different clusters around the country, then the Government will delay the spread “as best we can. The challenge is to slow down infection, to give health authorities time to cope.”Mr Coveney pointed out that even if only a small percentage of those infected suffer a significant health impact, the fatal percentage could mean thousands of deaths.“This is a challenge that is unprecedented. A lot is happening, advice will be upgraded on a daily basis.”Any decisions on public gatherings need to be made on the basis of sound evidence, he said. His own schedule for a trip to New York for St Patrick’s Day is being reviewed on a daily basis, he said.Any measures with regard to the coronavirus are only going to work if the public co-operates. “Together we can save lives.”Ireland’s Iseq stock market index rallied early on Tuesday, as global equity markets recovered some of the huge losses sustained in the previous session in the biggest sell-off since the 2008 financial crash.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199181.1583876011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rush to book earlier flights out of italy likely as airlines announce halts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing face masks walk at Leonardo da Vinci airport near Rome.

Aer Lingus will ground its planes starting today.British Airways has also cancelled all flights to and from Italy until April 4th, and other airlines have taken similar steps.The cancellations, for a four-week period, came in response to the Italian government announcing that the country was being locked down, with travel and movement of people severely restricted as it attempted to contain the spread of Covid-19.The move by the Irish airlines was all but inevitable after Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney updated his department’s travel advice on Tuesday, warning Irish citizens against travel to any part of Italy unless absolutely necessary.It was also facilitated by the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who confirmed that the EU was temporarily dropping strict rules stating that airlines must operate 80 per cent of scheduled services to keep their landing slots at airports.Earlier flightsRyanair, which is halting flights to and from Italy until April 8th, said passengers looking to be repatriated by it could obtain a move to an earlier Ryanair flight for free.Passengers due to travel to Italy will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months.Aer Lingus flights to and from Italy are expected to be suspended from today.Irish people with plans to travel to Italy as part of a package holiday will have to talk with tour operators to see what options they have while those who have booked trip’s independently will need to talk to your their travel insurer.People who have booked independently and do not have travel insurance already in place will most likely not have anything to fall back on and will have to bear the cost themselves.Italy’s nationwide lockdown limits travel to those with “verifiable work requirements or situations of necessity”.All sporting events have been suspended, and schools and universities have been shut until April 3rd.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTalks between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on forming a government will begin on Wednesday after a breakthrough between the two parties came amid increasing fears in political circles about the coronavirus. Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin last night issued identical statements saying that their negotiating teams should “now commence indepth detailed talks”. The leaders also said they would continue talks with the Green Party, which senior figures in both parties hope will join a historic coalition government.The move towards a coalition between the two parties – rivals since the 1920s that have never before shared power – comes more than a month after a general election that saw both lose seats and Sinn Féin’s popularity surge. Fianna Fáil currently has 37 TDs and Fine Gael has 35, meaning an alliance of the two would be eight votes short of a Dáil majority. This means additional support would be needed, with the Green Party and its 12 TDs seen as a possible route to securing a majority in the House. Rivals coalescingFine Gael and Fianna Fáil have refused to speak to Sinn Féin, which has 37 TDs, about forming a government, making a combination of the two the only viable administration. However, despite the progress reported last night, there remains considerable resistance to the idea of the rivals coalescing in both parties.An initial meeting will take place on Wednesday and this will be followed by more detailed exchanges in the coming days. A spokesman for the Taoiseach said Mr Varadkar would seek the approval of the Fine Gael parliamentary party next week before “formal” talks on a programme for government take place.The breakthrough after weeks of inconclusive contacts between various parties comes amid mounting concerns in Government about the threat from coronavirus, and the social and economic impact its spreading could have.‘Equal partners’“Both leaders are acutely aware of the enormous challenges facing the country particularly with the onset of Covid-19,” the party statements said. Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar said they would “enter the talks as equal partners determined to develop proposals which will serve the interests of the people of Ireland”. This is being interpreted as an acknowledgment that any coalition government would involving Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar alternating as the coalition leader. In an email to Fine Gael members, Mr Varadkar said his party was “once again . . . needed to stand by the State and our Republic”. He said he had intended to allow Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin time to try to form a government “either together or separately” but that the “public health emergency” posed by Covid-19 changed the context. In a video message to Fianna Fáil members, Mr Martin said the “public health crisis” presented by coronavirus made the formation of a government “an imperative”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199086.1583869416!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg s mary seery kearney added to ticket to contest seanad election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael Cllr Mary Seery Kearney  with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. File photograph: Mary Seery KearneyTwitter Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has nominated an additional female candidate to run on the Labour vocational panel in the Seanad election which takes place in a postal vote between March 16th and 30th.A Sinn Féin councillor has been excluded from the Agricultural panel because of insufficient qualifications.The Seanad will also be recalled next week, most likely on Friday, March 20th, to pass emergency social protection legislation to ease the existing rules governing sick pay.Fine Gael Cllr Mary Seery Kearney, who represents the party in the Rathfarnham-Templeogue area on South Dublin County Council, is now a candidate because there are an insufficient number of contestants on the Labour panel.The deadline for final nominations passed on March 2nd. However, in a quirk of the complex Seanad election regulations there is a requirement that there must be two more candidates on both “inside” and “outside” panels than the maximum number of candidates who can be elected on each side.Under the 1947 legislation, the Taoiseach is required to nominate a candidate if there are not enough contestants on inidual panels. Cllr Seery Kearney was selected from the Dublin South Central constituency where Fine Gael has no Dáil representation.The party had been criticised for the dearth of female candidates on the Fine Gael ticket and eyebrows were raised at the surprise omission of former Fine Gael Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell.There are 11 seats on the Labour panel and while there were eight “inside” candidates, by law there must be nine, as well as nine outside candidates. For an inside nomination a candidate must have the signature of four TDs andor Senators on their nomination papers. More than 100 civic society organisations representing sectoral interests can make an “outside” nomination.Insufficient qualificationsSeparately, Sinn Féin Cllr Paul Hayes from Cork South West was excluded as a candidate on the Agricultural panel because of insufficient qualifications or expertise.Cllr Hayes said on Tuesday he had been informed last week that there were concerns about his qualifications for the panel and he submitted additional paperwork.However, he was unable to attend an adjudication appeal on Monday to be conducted by a panel including a High Court judge and the Clerk of the Seanad. The panel reviews the suitability of all candidates for the relevant vocational panels.Cllr Hayes, who had contested the general election, said “outside” nominating body the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation had approached him about running and nominated him as they felt there is insufficient representation of fishermen in the Seanad.He is a member of the local authority coastal management committee and has been part of delegations to Brussels representing fishermen, but he accepted the decision that while he had knowledge of the area he did not have sufficient practical expertise."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4198956.1583864007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"serious talks on a programme for government to begin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNone of this means that a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Greens government will be any easier to put together. Photographs: Gareth ChaneyCollins \u0026 Alan BetsonThe Fears about the spread of the coronavirus and its implications for national life are accelerating in Government by the day. This will change the political context in the short-term and - if the outbreak is as bad as the worst-case scenarios project - it will change society and politics profoundly over the longer term.The immediate sign that the political context is changing is in the acceleration of the government formation process. At the weekend, senior figures in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael played down the prospect of any meaningful engagement on coalition formation between the two parties. This suggested that with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar bound for the US, and the Dáil being adjourned until March 19th, it would be after St Patrick’s Day before any serious business could be done. But now things are happening much quicker. The announcement by the two parties on Tuesday that they would begin “in depth detailed talks” is the biggest breakthrough in the process since the election and came after meetings between Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in recent days. TDs in both parties had begun to express impatience, believing that the public will not tolerate the sort of shilly-shallying that has marked engagements before now. Deputies in all parties believe voters will quickly run out of patience with politicians if serious moves towards forming a government are not made soon.There are very few people seriously entertaining the idea of a national government being assembled to deal with the crisis. This was partly because of an awareness that if difficult decisions have to be taken quickly, then a government containing all shades of opinion would be the worst vehicle imaginable for doing so. Even Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald pooh-poohed the idea.Extraordinarily difficultNone of this means that a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Greens government will be any easier to assemble. The policy and politics will still be extraordinarily difficult. But there is no question that the rising fear - amongst the public and within the political apparatus - has changed the external context significantly, and is pushing the two big parties together in a way it wasn’t previously.There is also, however, a realisation that the benign economic weather for any incoming administration has changed drastically. The shock to the world economy currently being delivered by the coronavirus outbreak is as yet unquantifiable but will certainly impact Ireland’s public finances. Therefore the resources available to the next government for large-scale investment in, for example, housing - an area where major action is viewed as being essential in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil - is unclear. Efforts to combat the virus are also likely to lead to a significant expansion in health spending, as well as footing the bill for the extension of sick leave, even as businesses face a cash crunch. The bottom line is that the next government will be doing a lot of up-front spending because of the crisis. This will restrict their options elsewhere for the sort of spending commitments that pad out a programme for government and make agreeing a policy platform easier.But the effects of the virus on Irish politics may well go far beyond an acceleration of government formation and big costs for the public purse. If the crisis deteriorates to the extent that the healthcare system is completely overwhelmed and the State cannot cope, that is likely to shatter public confidence in politics and parties that would inevitably be seen by people to have failed. Should there be huge numbers of deaths from the virus, the shock of that would scar and change Irish society profoundly. It would change our politics in ways it is hard now to imagine."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199026.1583863765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how dutch false sense of security helped coronavirus spread","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister Mark Rutte gives Bruno Bruins, minister for medical care, an elbow greeting. Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199165.1583882292!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy s streets empty in historic lockdown to halt spread of coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeserted Via del Corso in Rome: Austria banned entry to people from Italy on Tuesday, introducing checks on its border.

Now more than ever, everyone’s contribution is decisive.”On Monday night, prime minister Giuseppe Conte placed the entire country under quarantine without warning, rolling out controls previously in place only for the worst-hit areas.Nearly three in four deaths have been in Lombardy, a hub of industry and Italy’s richest region, and the government is desperate to prevent the outbreak descending on the country’s poorer south, where less developed health services could struggle to cope.Citizens must fill out a form to justify any venture out of the house. They can do so for proven work reasons, necessities like food shopping, health reasons or to return to their place of residence.Police controlsThere are police checks on roads and at train stations, and people violating the law can be fined and imprisoned for three months. Anyone who has tested positive for the virus, or has been ordered to quarantine due to possible exposure, is completely banned from leaving home.All sport in the country is suspended until April 3rd, including Serie A football, in a situation described by Italy’s Olympic Committee CONI as having “no precedent in history”.As stock markets ed and the widening shutdown of economic activity threatened to trigger a crash, the European Commission announced it would use all tools available to boost economies.“The crisis we face because of coronavirus has both a very significant human dimension and a potentially major economic impact,” said commission president Ursula von der Leyen after a teleconference with EU leaders, as she announced state aid and borrowing rules would be eased and hinted at intervention from the European Central Bank in a bid to calm markets.“It is therefore essential that we act very decisively and collectively first of all to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, and to counter the economic fallout,” she said.Austrian banAustria banned entry to people from Italy on Tuesday, introducing checks on its border, an exceptional move for two countries that are part of the check-free Schengen zone.“The utmost priority is to prevent the spread and thus the importing of the illness into our society,” chancellor Sebastian Kurz told a news conference. “There is therefore a ban on entry for people from Italy into Austria, with the exception of people who have a doctor’s note.”New figures released by Italian public health body the ISS showed that one in four cases identified in Italy as of March 9th were hospitalised, with 19 per cent “critical”.While a fifth of diagnoses were among people aged 19-50, more than half of deaths were of people aged over 80, a third were people in their 70s, one in 10 were of people in their 60s.“These data confirm how all age groups contribute to the spread of infection, and unfortunately the worst effects affect frail elderly people,” said ISS chief Silvio Brusaferro as she urged younger people to take the virus seriously.“Giving up a party or an aperitif with friends . . . is a duty to protect your own health and that of others, especially the most fragile.”The country shut down schools in several regions, suspended flights from Italy and advised against all non-essential travel on Tuesday in the hope of stemming a rising tide of coronavirus cases.The number of confirmed cases increased threefold from Sunday and tenfold in a week, prompting Spain, which had so far taken few drastic steps, to change tack and announce a slew of measures.The government banned indoor gatherings of more than 1,000 people in the most affected regions – Madrid, the Rioja wine-growing region and two areas in the northern Basque Country, while all La Liga football matches will be played behind closed doors for at least two weeks.US President Donald Trump said the coronavirus outbreak would “go away” and urged Americans to remain calm as cases jumped and the White House came under mounting pressure to boost its response to the health and economic crisis.A steady rise in the number of US cases of Covid-19 has spurred calls within Congress for action to expand testing and avert an economic meltdown. About three-quarters of US states now have confirmed Covid-19 with more than 800 Americans infected.Washington state’s governor warned of tens of thousands more cases without “real action” and New York’s governor deployed National Guard troops as a containment measure in a hard-hit New York City suburb.“It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,” Mr Trump said after a meeting on Capitol Hill with Republican lawmakers. “We want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships. We want to protect our airlines industry.”Mr Trump, who in the past two days has broached a payroll tax cut and relief for companies hard hit by coronavirus fears, offered no specific details on what had been discussed in a meeting with his top economic officials.Greece and North Macedonia Both countries on Tuesday announced all schools, universities and kindergartens would be shut for the next 14 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199007.1583862982!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia opens path for putin to retain power until 2036","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Russian president Vladimir Putin speaks during a plenary session of the State Duma  in Moscow, Russia, on Tuesday. Photograph: Yuri KochetkovEPARussian deputies have backed a proposal that could allow Vladimir Putin, who has ruled the country for 20 years, to remain president until 2036.Former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space and now a deputy for the ruling United Russia party, told parliament on Tuesday that constitutional changes planned for this year should “reset” presidential term limits, allowing Mr Putin to run for office again when his current mandate expires in 2024.United Russia supported her motion but said Mr Putin should be consulted, and he quickly made the short journey from the Kremlin to the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.“In principle, this option would be possible under one condition,” Mr Putin said of Ms Tereshkova’s proposal.“That the constitutional court of the Russian Federation gives an official ruling that such an amendment does not contradict the principles and main provisions of the basic law – the constitution.”Vladimir LeninHe said the proposal should also be approved by the public in a vote on constitutional changes that is scheduled for April 22nd, which happens to be the 150th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union. Given the Kremlin’s influence over Russia’s law courts, state media and voting system, there is little doubt that the amendments will go through if Mr Putin continues to support them.Russian citizens will have their say next month only after both houses of parliament have approved the constitutional changes, which deputies backed on Tuesday in the second of three readings. They also voted in favour of Ms Tereshkova’s proposal.Mr Putin (67) has not said what he plans to do when his mandate ends, but his announcement in January of a constitutional shake-up fuelled speculation that he was examining ways to retain power beyond 2024.This is his fourth presidential term and he has also served as Russia’s prime minister. The changes supported by the Duma would allow him to run for another two six-year stints in the Kremlin ending in 2036, when he will turn 84.Centralised controlMr Putin’s supporters praise him for bringing strong, centralised control back to Russia while seeing no other contender for the presidency, while critics point out that the former KGB agent has used the levers of state to stifle opposition and crush potential competitors.As Russian markets and the rouble reeled from a plunge in oil prices, Mr Putin told deputies that the presidency should continue to be the nation’s most powerful institution, so as to provide stability and ensure the country “evolves” only gradually and withstands domestic and international turbulence.“It is namely the president who is the guarantor of the constitution, or to put it more simply, the guarantor of the security of our state, its internal stability and evolutionary development...We have already had enough revolutions,” he said.“Everyone understands full well that inside the country, unfortunately, a lot has been done ‘on the fly’ as people say,” Mr Putin added. “We still have a lot of vulnerability, including with regard to domestic political stability, inter-ethnic and inter-religious harmony and economic and social development.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199224.1583881862!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk junior health minister diagnosed with coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Nadine Dorries: ‘I can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus.

Just wondered if you know who the contact in the party is to, with 100 per cent confidentially, discuss sexual misconduct?She told the jury she was confused and very scared and wanted to know if there was a process to report her claims. The SNP compliance official replied and asked whether her allegations related to a parliamentarian. She responded that it was an ex-parliamentarian, adding: You can guess who… Happy to speak next week. I really don\u0027t want it to be public. Just on internal records.Mr McCann then wrote: Happy to meet, speak on the phone, text or email. Or would you prefer to talk to the solicitor on the first instance if it\u0027s for internal knowledge rather than action? The solicitor would report details of allegations to me but can withhold your name if you prefer.Nine minutes, later she wrote: I obviously trust you and happy to speak to you rather than use a lawyer. I\u0027m not in England – so a call next week.On November 6 2017, the SNP official sent a text to Woman H which read: I appreciate how difficult that must have been. I will sit on that and hopefully never have to deploy it.Asked by by Shelagh McCall QC, for Mr Salmond, what she made of his message, the woman said that when she first lodged her concerns about what had happened she believed it would be a useful vetting issue to see whether Mr Salmond was fit for office if he ever wanted to stand for the party.Asked by Alex Prentice QC, for the prosecution, what she had hoped to achieve by contacting the SNP, she said: I still hadn\u0027t come to terms with what had happened. I knew I was driven by the fact I didn\u0027t want anyone else who worked with him to have what happened to me happen to them.That was my desire – still is. I wanted to have it on his file.

The issue has been raised in meetings between the Treasury and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which have been taking place on a daily basis over the past 10 days.The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been urged to halt business rates payments to allow firms to weather the crisis. As of Tuesday night, 382 people were infected in the UK, and a sixth patient died after testing positive for the virus.On Wednesday, the Treasury is expected to announce plans to underwrite bank loans to encourage lending to affected firms. Further measures could include a hardship fund giving cash handouts to businesses to which banks refuse to lend.Countries across the world have announced moves to mitigate the effects of the crisis. On Tuesday, Italy said it would inject €10 billion (£8.7 billion) into the economy, while the US president, Donald Trump, announced plans for a very substantial payroll tax cut to help workers who miss wages when on sick leave, on top of an $8.3 billion (£6.4 billion) emergency coronavirus spending package.The moves came as the number of deaths in Italy rose from 463 to 631, taking the virus mortality rate to more than six per cent as the total number of people infected reached 10,149.The NHS has announced it is expanding testing for the virus, with up to 10,000 patients being tested every day.Latest figures have shown 373 people infected in the UK and a sixth patient dying after testing positive for the virus. Until now, the NHS has only had capacity for 2,000 tests a day, with some patients complaining it has taken nine days to get their results. The expansion in testing - including “drive-thru” services - is likely to see cases in the UK soar, with warnings that the peak of the epidemic is likely to start in a fortnight.Italy was in lockdown on Tuesday, with tens of thousands of Britons effectively stranded after airlines including British Airways cancelled flights in and out of the country.Responding to fears that public transport could be helping to spread the virus, Transport for London (TfL) announced that it had started an enhanced cleaning regime. Additional substances that kill viruses and bacteria are being used across the London Underground and bus networks, the organisation said.The busiest stations will be cleaned more regularly than usual, while TfL is testing a new disinfectant which could provide up to 30 days of anti-viral protection.It has emerged that next week\u0027s Royal Television Society Programme Awards will be held behind closed doors, as will the first leg of Manchester United\u0027s Europa League match against LASK in Linz following advice from the Austrian government.On Tuesday, MPs welcomed the mortgage relief announced by banks, with the Conservative MP Steve Baker, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, saying: I am delighted to see banks putting customers first and demonstrating such good will.The Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Santander UK, Virgin Money and TSB have all offered to suspend mortgage repayments for borrowers in self-isolation or too ill to work.RBS, largely owned by the taxpayer, said payments could be delayed by up to three months, while TSB promised a relief on repayments of up to two months. Nationwide said it would determine the length of payment holidays for mortgage customers on a case-by-case basis. RBS added that it would determine whether or not people affected by coronavirus qualify for the relief also on a case-by-case basis. A spokesman said: If someone feels they cannot meet their mortgage payments, they can get in touch.Interest will still accrue during the payment holidays, RBS, TSB, Virgin Money and Lloyds told The . This means homeowners will see monthly bills rise slightly when they resume payments.The coronavirus outbreak could cost households, with millions of self-employed people expected to be the worst affected while self-isolating or losing work if businesses begin to struggle to keep paying wages.Asked whether borrowers would need a doctor\u0027s note to qualify for the three-month relief, RBS said: We haven\u0027t gone into that level of detail. It will be down to the circumstances the bank is presented with.Banks are also dropping fees for missed payments on credit cards, allowing customers to increase their credit card limit or cash withdrawal limit to £500 and waiving fees for savers who want to withdraw their money early.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: We welcome banks offering help to their customers. As the Prime Minister has said, if businesses and iniduals across the UK pull together in a united national effort it will help us to get through the significant challenge of the coronavirus outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus rising different countries uk among countries seefastest","story":"Most of the countries are in Europe – 11 in total, including the UK, France and Germany. Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden have seen the highest rate of increase over the last week, with cases in Belgium surging by over 3,000 per cent in seven days.As of last Monday, Belgium had just seven active coronavirus cases – but that figure had leaped to 238 as of Monday.The UK saw the fourth-highest increase in cases over the last week, according to data recorded by Johns Hopkins University. There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nadine dorries infected coronavirus","story":"Public health officials were yesterday seeking to trace anyone in contact Nadine Dorries after it emerged the health minister had contracted coronavirus.Boris Johnson, who was with her at a Downing Street event to mark International Women’s Day, and her boss Health Secretary Matt Hancock may have to be tested if they display symptoms.Ms Dorries, who met hundreds of people as part of her duties, became ill last Friday but was not confirmed with the virus until yesterday evening. She has been working in Parliament and the Department of Health and Social Care for the past week and on Thursday attended the Downing Street event with the Prime Minister.Experts believe people infected with the virus can carry it for up to five days before symptoms emerge. Ms Dorries, 62, started feeling ill on Friday as she was signing a statutory instrument that declared coronavirus to be a “notifiable disease”, enabling companies to obtain insurance cover. The health minister held a surgery in her Mid Bedfordshire constituency on Saturday, attended by 50 people but over the weekend she experienced the “classic symptoms” of the disease — a dry cough, high temperature and “vice-like” pain in her chest.A government source said: “As with everything, we are being guided by the science on this. This will be treated like any other standard case. Officials are conducting the standard process of contact tracing and identifying anyone who has shown symptoms.”A health department source said: “We are lucky in the timing because Matt last saw Nadine last Wednesday and her symptoms only came on at the back end of the week.Matt has no symptoms and therefore is okay.“Nadine self isolated on Saturday so over the weekend it’s hoped all traces were gone. We know Nadine was in Number 10 last week but it is not certain how much contact she had with the PM. You have to be within two metres for more than 20 minutes.”The disclosure will raise concerns about whether Parliament needs to be curtailed. Earlier this week the parliamentary authorities decided against taking action to either restrict access to parliament or close it down. Mr Hancock said it should stay open because scrutiny is “incredibly important” during the outbreak.The decision was due to be reviewed early next week. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has warned elderly peers and MPs that they might be told to stay at home for their own protection.Last night leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said there were no current plans to shut down parliament. “Parliamentary authorities are already taking advice from the Chief Medical Officer and will continue to do so.”Sources said that the feeling inside Number 10 was that parliament needed to be kept open. According to one cabinet minister: “There’s a feeling at all levels that Parliament needs to remain operational to pass the PM’s emergency legislation and the finance bill.Ms Dorries is understood to be over the worst and is recovering well.

Nine were foreign nationals – seven of them British – and everyone who travelled on the aircraft is now under quarantine.According to the , British couple Graham and Mary Craddock, now quarantined after catching Covid-19, were told they had unknowingly left infections everywhere over several days before being diagnosed.Vietnam had enjoyed 22 days with no new infections until last Friday, and had been praised for its robust response to the epidemic.  The country\u0027s media reported accusations that lax UK procedures had allowed the virus to re-enter the country, where it was likely to spread further.Public resentment was fuelled by a separate report that a friend of the socialite had gone to a London hospital for treatment, informing doctors that she had been in contact with an infected patient, but was not tested for Covid-19 and was instead told to self-isolate.The 24-year-old woman\u0027s family were so worried that they rented a private plane to fly her back to Vietnam, where she tested positive for the virus.With so many coronavirus cases arrived from the UK, there\u0027s a certain unease, even antipathy, on Vietnamese social media about British visitors, tweeted Nga Pham, a BBC journalist. Many think UK government hasn\u0027t done enough to contain the virus.Bach Do, who runs a Ho Chi Minh city-based Twitter account with more than 83,000 followers, said the latest developments had left many Vietnamese citizens questioning the entire system in the UK.Let me put this in context: there are 15 new cases in Vietnam, 14 of which traced back to the UK, with 7 Brits being actual (sic) infected.

Any Democrat running against Donald Trump in November would have to win Michigan.It showed, once and for all, that Mr Sanders\u0027 revolution is not happening, or at least not on the scale he needed it to.In state after state, so far, there has been no explosion in voter turnout.There has been no horde of factory workers uniting around the promise of government-funded universal healthcare.And no flood of millennials raised from their sofas on voting day by the prospect of free college tuition under a Sanders administration.In Michigan, Mr Sanders did win 82 per cent of voters aged under 30. But there simply weren\u0027t enough of them. They were swept away by a grey tide of over-65s backing Mr Biden.Mr Sanders failed, in the end, to conquer the apathy of the young.An additional blow came as anecdotal evidence in Michigan suggested Elizabeth Warren\u0027s supporters had sided with Mr Biden.Ms Warren, a standard bearer for the Democrats\u0027s progressive wing, dropped out after Super Tuesday.It would have seemed natural for her to endorse her friend Mr Sanders, but she decided to back no-one immediately.Exit polls also showed that many Democrat voters, including some of Mr Sanders\u0027 own supporters, believe the time has come to unify the party.Their overwhelming motivation is to defeat Mr Trump, and many appear to have decided that Mr Biden has the best chance.For Mr Sanders, there is no way to tack his policies to the prevailing wind. They are set in stone.In a week\u0027s time several other large states vote including Florida, where he is now 40 points behind Mr Biden in polls.It is becoming increasingly difficult to see a rationale for him to go on.His only realistic hope lies in a debate with Mr Biden on Sunday.It will be the first one-on-one encounter between the two men, and Mr Sanders is widely considered the stronger debater.He will use it to make a final argument that the Democrats should pick a nominee who represents the starkest contrast to Mr Trump.Mr Sanders will need to not only win the debate, but eviscerate Mr Biden, if the race is to continue.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/10/17/adidas.jpg","title":"adidas google fifa mobile 20 ultimate team gmr boot smart","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Playing physical football will lead to improvements in virtual playersAdidas, Google and the Fifa game have teamed up to create a smart football boot.The technology – known as Adidas GMR – watches how people play in real life, allowing them to complete challenges or hit milestones.When they do, they will be rewarded with improvements within Fifa Mobile, allowing them to unlock in-game rewards or improve the performance of their team within Fifa Mobile Ultimate Team.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe technology brings together insoles made for Adidas football boots with Google\u0027s Jacquard technology, which allows smart fabric to be sewn into otherwise normal pieces of clothing.It has already been integrated into backpacks and denim jackets, for instance, allowing wearers to swipe on a sleeve and change the song that is playing on their phone.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place. The novel coronavirus has now spread to more than 113,000 cases globally and killed over 3,900 people.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a huge responsibility, and we know we’re going to make some mistakes.”Einhorn’s dilemma is playing out on a global stage. With the deadly virus now present in 100 countries, companies are unable to match demand for the masks needed by health workers. That’s led governments to jockey for supplies, including the US, which is stockpiling, and Germany and South Korea, which banned exports of masks altogether.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPublic health officials are warning that restrictive trade measures tied to medical supplies could worsen the shortfall and risk making poorer nations more vulnerable to the coronavirus’ spread.In some countries, including Japan and Germany, doctors are being told to reuse the single mask they get daily because of a lack of supply.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China“Most places are not prepared, so you now have a cascade of countries putting these export bans in place,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It’s not a long-term solution. Everyone throwing up export bans isn’t going to solve the problem of how you will get the products in time to serve these acute needs.”Peter Navarro, one of President Donald Trump’s trade advisers, met last week with a group of pharmaceutical companies to discuss supply chain vulnerabilities and ways to ensure that critical parts of the drug supply chain could move away from China -- or better, back to the U.S., people familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg. Navarro didn’t respond to requests for comment.Manufacturers need to boost production of masks by another 40 per cent\u0026nbspto meet demand, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s director general. While the WHO has shipped supplies to 47 countries including Iran, Cambodia and Uganda, shortages will hit soon, especially of the N95 masks that block out 95 per cent\u0026nbspof airborne particulates to combat the current virus.“Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding,” Tedros said in a statement 3 March. “We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first,” he said, referring to the illness caused by the virus.Despite Tedros’ appeal, South Korea, Germany and Russia announced export bans of masks and other protective gear days after. They join others nation or territories including India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Kazakhstan that earlier put export bans in place. The novel coronavirus has now spread to more than 113,000 cases globally and killed over 3,900 people.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories have since boosted production more than five-fold and are enlisting carmakers to manufacture them. That’s still not enough.In the US, increased efforts by mask makers 3M Co. and DuPont De Nemours Inc. are also falling short of demand. DuPont, which makes masks and protective body suits worn by first responders, said it’s increased production by more than three times its usual global capacity. 3M, the biggest American manufacturer of N95 respirators, has increased production since the outbreak in China.“We’ve added staff, we’ve added overtime, we’ve added technology, we’ve been increasing manufacturing lines,” said 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich. “We expect this demand for respirators and other supplies to continue to outpace supply for the foreseeable future.”The dependence on China and a few other countries for masks has some calling for a rethink of supply chains. The World Medical Association, which represents physicians, wants governments to establish factories in major markets like the European Union and the U.S. to ensure adequate supply of critical drugs, vaccines and other medical necessities.The US only has about 1 per cent of the 3.5 billion masks it needs to combat a serious outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said. The country plans to buy 500 million surgical masks and N95 respirators for the national stockpile.Einhorn of Dealmed thinks the shortage isn’t likely to let up until the summer. The crisis may finally convince Americans to pay more for masks made in the US, he said. Dealmed is seeking bids for domestically-produced equipment.“The world shouldn’t be relying on one country for health care products,” Einhorn said. “We absolutely need to look at the supply chain.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Apple\u0027s annual WWDC event, which marks the highlight of its year for new software features and its developers, is also likely to be cancelled under the ban.Apple holds its new phone launches in its Steve Jobs Theater, which has a capacity of 1,000 and is usually fully packed.\u0026nbspIt is very possible that Apple could launch the new phone without a large scale event, and it has released products with much smaller events or without a launch event at all in the past.Its Worldwide Developers Conference brings together more than 5,000 developers and as a consequence is even less likely to go ahead. That event has not yet been announced either but runs on an annual schedule, being held in San Jose every year.Previous reports have suggested that Apple\u0027s product pipeline – including the iPhone 12, which is expected much later in the year – could be affected by coronavirus, which is reducing both demand for new devices as well as the ability to supply enough models in time.It will also mean other major events such as sporting fixtures will no longer go ahead.The ban had been brought in to slow the spread of the disease, said\u0026nbspSanta Clara County health officer\u0026nbspSara Cody in a statement.Created with Sketch.Streets of Italy empty in coronavirus lockdown Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 MarchThe Via Partenope in Naples is empty after Italy was put on lockdown on 10 March A waiter stands by empty tables outside a restaurant in St Mark\u0027s Square in Venice on 9 MarchEmpty stands during a football match between Sassuolo and Brescia at the Mapei stadium in Reggio Emilia, northern Italy on 9 MarchShops are shuttered on an empty street in Venice on 9 MarchPeople keep a safe distance while lining up to enter a post office in Rome on 10 MarchA canal and the roads next to it are completely empty on 9 MarchA completely empty bridge in Venice on 9 MarchA canal pathway in Venice is empty after Italy was put on lockdownAn empty square in Venice on 9 MarchA nearly empty tram drives through Milan on 10 MarchAn empty bakery in Milan on 10 MarchAn empty street in Milan on 10 March“Today’s order and new recommendations will reduce the number of people who develop severe illness and will help prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.“This is critically important for anyone with healthcare needs, not just those most vulnerable to serious illness from\u0026nbspCOVID-19.”\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They issued new forecasts on Monday amid the worst meltdown in global markets since the 2008 financial crash.Berenberg projected the Eurozone’s GDP to fall by 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 0.5 per cent in the second quarter.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnalysts said the sweeping month-long lockdown imposed by Italy, the zone’s third largest economy, on 16 million people “goes beyond the disruptions we had anticipated”.“The Italian measures — and the possibility that other parts of Europe may move in the same direction in coming weeks — are likely to weigh significantly further on confidence in the near term,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank.Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe bank predicted Italy’s economy would contract by 1.2 per cent by the end of the 2020, and said its forecasts for the next few months would be “shaped much more by the coronavirus epidemic than by economic fundamentals or shifts in monetary or fiscal policy”.France’s central bank said it expected the country’s economy to barely grow in the first quarter of the year, cutting its GDP forecast from 0.3 per cent 0.1 per cent.Coronavirus could tip Europe into recession, OECD warnsThe country’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Europe needed a “call to arms” to defend the already weakened economy from an outbreak that has disrupted companies’ supply chains, forced airlines to cut capacity and prompted shoppers in some countries to stockpile food.The downbeat assessments made for a grim start to the week for European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers, who will meet in Frankfurt this week and may be forced to lower interest rates and step up bond purchases. The US Federal Reserve has already acted, with an unexpected easing last week.The ECB told most of its 3,500-plus staff to work from home on Monday to test how it could cope with a coronavirus shutdown. It has cancelled most of its public events over the next month but said its rate-setting Governing Council meeting would go ahead as scheduled on Thursday.The turmoil in global markets on Monday was deepened by\u0026nbspan all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which has led to stocks and oil prices tanking around the world.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other companies to have tried and failed include Orbcomm and Irdium.Mr Musk said he hoped\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0027s Starlink will be the first successful effort and said it should go live in northern US and Canada later this year. A global roll out will then follow in 2021.Users in remote areas or regions with poor internet connectivity would be able to plug a dongle into their device, which resembles a UFO on a stick.\u0026nbspThey would then be able to stream high-definition movies and play online video games.The box will have just two instructions and they can be done in either order: point at sky, plug in, he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think it’s also Disney’s first battle epic? It is beautiful \u0026amp absorbing \u0026amp rich \u0026amp empowering. The cast is excellent and Niki Caro’s direction is just breathtaking.”“The cast of Mulan is fantastic in the film,” said another. “There are lots of little moments that nods to the animated that’ll make the fans happy. Very beautiful \u0026amp epic cinematography. It had more fantastical elements than I expected. Overall, a great re-telling of the animated and very fun.”Kelvin Harrison Jr on black excellence, police brutality and TrumpA third added:\u0026nbsp”Mulan is one of the best live-action adaptation of a Disney animated classic. It honours the 1998 film and the ballad by modernising themes of female empowerment and iconic scenes, while also standing out w great cinematography \u0026amp battle sequences are reminiscent of Wuxia epics.”The remake stars Yifei Liu, Donnie Yen, Jason Scott Lee and Jet Li, and just like the original film it follows a woman who disguises herself as a man to fight in China’s imperial army.Mulan will arrive in UK cinemas on 27 March.

So I have looked at what is the biggest single thing I can do to reduce my carbon footprint and it is to give up red meat.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s as simple as that: you run the figures, that is probably the single biggest thing that any consumer can do tomorrow. Things that you can do instantaneously.Lord Turner added: I think the issue of persuading people to eat significantly less red meat in particular is one that we\u0027re not going to be able to shy away from if we\u0027re serious about a zero carbon economy.He suggested a methane tax could be applied to both imports and domestic production to help address the issue and steer people to alternatives.But Tory MP Ms Baldwin, who sits on the committee, intervened to disagree, telling the economist: I\u0027m increasingly worried that people as influential as yourself, Lord Turner, make these statements about red meat when you think about the difference between sustainably grown cattle and, you know, flying in soya beans from Brazil.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A 2018 study published in the journal Nature by academics at Princeton University found that protein from beef had 73 times the carbon emissions of protein from soya, with 1kg of beef protein having the equivalent carbon emissions of passenger\u0027s return flight between London and New York.\u0026nbspContrary to the MP\u0027s claim, soya beans do not tend to be transported by air as their delivery is not particularly time-sensitive, and surface transport in fact constitutes a relatively small proportion of the carbon emissions of all food.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

Central London (pictured), where the city bustle tends to mean that snow doesn\u0027t even settle, was covered in inches of snow for dayMonths after the cold snap, a heatwave struck Britain, rendering the normally plush green of England\u0027s parks in Summer a parched brown for weeksWorsening droughts in many countries have been disastrous for crop yields and have threatened livestock. In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueResponding to the MP, Lord Turner said he accepted that there is a real difference between grass-fed and stuff produced in a beef lot but added: The fact is they all produce methane emissions and methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas.\u0026nbspWe can\u0027t get around that. It doesn\u0027t mean people have to give up red meat, but I think the way forward is smaller consumption of red meat, but when you consume red meat have high quality, organic, low environmental impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Do it again,” the prime minister said, as he broke into a laugh.The pair then demonstrated an elbow bump greeting before leaving the stage.On Tuesday, Dutch health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had risen by 61 to 382, with four deaths reported.The mistake has shown the difficulty governments face with attempts to prevent outbreaks of the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which is believed to spread in a similar way to influenza.Last week, the World Health Organisation said it was understood that coronavirus spreads “via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick”.Health officials have advised people to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who are unwell, and cover their mouth or nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughingsneezing to prevent the spread of the virus.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Late on Monday, prime minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree ordering the most severe travel restrictions in Europe, in a move that follows China’s blueprint to contain the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMovement by air or land anywhere inside or outside the country is currently allowed only for emergencies or towards one’s town of residence, with fines and jail sentences potentially handed out to those who breach the rule. All public gatherings have also been cancelled, and all schools and universities closed.Linate airport –\u0026nbspa bustling hub for low-cost companies –\u0026nbspwas deserted on Tuesday morning as no more than a dozen passengers queued at the only open gate. Police officers collected a legally-binding self-certification stating the reason for the trip before allowing them to swipe their boarding pass.In a nation where family runs deep into the cultural fabric, travel restrictions have touched a nerve.Merlì’s partner, a Nigerian national, was boarding a flight back to her country of origin, where her son is attending school.\u0026nbspTravel restrictions will make it impossible for them to ide their time between the two countries and visit Merlì, who works in Italy.“I have no clue when they will be back,” the 48-year-old dad sighed.Greece was one thing – Italy may be too big for the EU to saveThis is what it was like on the coronavirus frontline in ItalyWhole of Italy placed in quarantine and all public events bannedCould Italy’s radical containment efforts soon be adopted in Britain?Should I cancel my trip to Italy over coronavirus fears?Italy is the first country to adopt such draconian measures restricting travel in the European Union – which rests on the freedom to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states.Fears of a looming pandemic have put the\u0026nbspunity of the EU to the test. Austria, which shares a border with Italy and has reported 158 cases so far, was the first on Tuesday to announce a ban on all arrivals from Italy by car, train or plane, except for medical emergencies.Flagship company Alitalia reduced the\u0026nbspnumber of daily flights departing from Linate from 204 to 26 on Tuesday.

Authorities have since clarified that residents will be able to make the trip back to their hometowns, provided they self-quarantine and fill out a self-certification with which they legally attest to the truthfulness of their claims.Yet, those who are regularly employed and have families in other regions of Italy must endure the separation or risk not being able to return to their workplace.“My heart is split in half,” Rosj Camarda, a Sicilian employee at an energy service company told The Independent.While her elderly parents live in Sant’Agata Militello, a small town some 80 miles from Palermo, her job and fiancé are in Milan.“I had to choose between my family and my partner,” she said, adding that the aggressive media campaign calling on southerners to refrain from travelling home had made her realise the gravity of the situation.“I decided to stay in Milan in order not to put my family at risk,” she said. “But being separated from your family and not being there for them in case something happens is the worse feeling of all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In January,\u0026nbsphe proposed changing the constitution that would limit the presidency to two terms overall. On face value, that created additional barriers to Mr Putin staying on —\u0026nbspthe solution favoured by most of Russia’s ruling class.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, parliamentarians offered a not-unexpected lifeline to their patron.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesValentina Tereshkova, a former cosmonaut and uber loyal deputy of the ruling party fraction in the State Duma, said changes should be dictated by the will of “the people.” But her opinion was clear: either the term limit should be removed, or reset for Mr Putin.\u0026nbspSpeaker Vyacheslav Volodin convened a 90 minute pause in the parliamentary sitting to “discuss” the proposals. A short while later Mr Putin made the short trip over from the Kremlin to give his reaction.\u0026nbspPutin has US \u0027exactly where he wants us\u0027, says key impeachment witnessTrump accused of threatening elections after interference warningAnyone near germaphobic Putin ‘temperature checked’ for coronavirusHe said he was open to the idea of a further two elections\u0026nbsp—\u0026nbspextending his tenure to his 80s, and comfortably past the previous record innings set by Joseph Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.\u0026nbsp“It’s a possible option in principle, but on one contrition: if the constitutional court decides that such an amendment will not contravene the constitution,” Mr Putin said. “We aren’t adopting a new constitution, but making significant amendments to it.”\u0026nbspUnder the proposals Mr Putin put forward, appointments to the constitutional court are to be made by the president himself. This is one of several areas that will see presidential power increased.\u0026nbspResetting presidential terms was seen by many experts as the most straightforward way for the president to get around his 2024 problem - but also the most cynical.\u0026nbspIn 2011, Russian public opinion reacted strongly against a similarly transparent manoeuvre. Mr Putin’s return to office in place of Dmitry Medvedev was met with massive street protests that at one point threatened to spiral out of control.\u0026nbspSpeaking at parliament, Mr Putin insisted his aim was to leave a democratic legacy. He would not support removing the term limit in entirety, for example.\u0026nbsp“If the country is to be dynamic, it needs its leaders to change,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And with council house waiting lists impossibly long they end up handing over obscene percentages of their pay to landlords.Affordable social housing would give them a stable  from which to build a le, family and career.The Tories must keep faith with the home ownership revolution they kick-started decades ago.But the number of new council homes is below those being sold or demolished. That is scandalous.So we back the  Tory MPs, including former council house lad and Cabinet Minister David Davis, imploring Chancellor Rishi Sunak to spend billions building more.Many ex-Labour voters turned to the Tories for just such le-changing opportunities.IT’S easy outside Government to demand unprecedented shutdowns and restrictions hoping to limit the spread of coronavirus.It’s a win-win for ex-politicians and pundits. They wouldn’t get the blame for the panic, economic meltdown, bankruptcies and lost jobs.We would probably never be able to assess how well their plan worked — but they would always take credit for saving some lives.Downing Street has to be more cautious, with business nervous and stock markets in freefall. It is following the scientic advice and that seems wise.Half the country thinks Britain is over-reacting. The other half is stockpiling loo roll. Some are in both camps.We have five tragic deaths so far and a steady but not yet explosive daily rise in cases.

It’s been under Aprican rule ever since.”Immediate consequences seem to be a dramatic improvement in the weather, everyone in London is now dressed like Graham Norton and there’s a ban on black people and white people holding hands on buses.Love can breach the racial ide, though. Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat. Miriam Margolyes on The One Show.”The Sex Clinic, Esther: “I’d say my sex le is very spontaneous.”Lonely, desolate, unfulfilled, messy, abandoned, solitary, forlorn, a cry for help and all those other things Vanessa Feltz once scrawled on a Celebrity Big Brother table.And why hasn’t Sharon ­listened to Denny’s phone message incriminating Ian  It really would speed this storyline along a bit.WORLD heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury could quite easily have become the most intimidating oaf on the planet.The fact he didn’t and is a surprisingly endearing figure owes something to his continued attachment to home town Morecambe, in Lancashire, and its rubbish disposal unit, which, Tyson explained last Thursday, he faithfully visits “twice a week”, while also taking the car for a mini-valet on a Monday and: “Shaving me head.”It’s a devotion dwarfed only by Tyson’s love for his five children, three of whom are called Prince, and heroic we, Paris, who endures his mood swings and singing with a resolve that would put a few of his opponents to shame.All of which made him the perfect subject for ITV’s fly-on-the-wall documentary Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, a three-part dream of a series which came to a thrilling and touching conclusion last Thursday, with footage of his win over Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas.Victory was followed by a slightly baffling chorus of American Pie before Tyson grabbed the first available phone to speak to his terrying dad, John, who’d been forced to watch the fight back in England, for GBH-related reasons.Only one question seemed to matter by that stage. “Did I look good on the telly, Dad ” Outstanding, Tyson, son.

We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Mr Quince has previously defended the repayment scheme and insisted advice is available to those on the scheme.He said: Advances are an important tool to help the most vulnerable claimants receive the money they need to live on.Proposed repayments of an advance payment are explained as part of the application process, and all claimants are advised to request the level of advance which is manageable when considering the repayments required.Under the controversial benefits system, working parents can claim up to  per cent of their childcare costs - worth up to a maximum of £ a month for one child or up to £, a month for two or more children.But they have to pay these bills in advance before waiting up to a month to be reimbursed. And bills often end up being much higher than what the government pays out.The Sun is calling for these costs to be paid upfront by the Department for Work and Pensionsas part of our Make Universal Credit Work campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast temperatures plunge","story":"The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for snow and ice in parts of the UK on Wednesday and Thursday.The alerts are in place until am on Thursday morning - although the cold spell is set to last until the end of the week.The lowest temperatures are expected to hit on Friday night, with the mercury dropping to -C in Scotland and dipping below zero across the north of England.According to the Met Office, Norwich, Manchester and Newcastle will be among the worst areas hit.Met Office Meteorologist, Emma Salter, told the Sun Online: “There’s definitely going to be quite a dferent feel in the weather over the next couple of days.Anywhere that’s m above sea level is likely to see about cm of snow on Wednesday night in to Thursday.As we go through the week the winds will change and we’ll get that cold feel.Every night this week we could get a couple [of places] dipping below freezing.The cold blast will see widespread frost and some snow in parts of the UK on Wednesday night.The Met Office has also warned that roads and pavements could become icy.Over the weekend temperatures are set to reach -C in Newcastle and -C in Norwich in the early hours of Saturday.Manchester could also dip below freezing.It follows mild temperatures across the UK in the last few days, with highs reaching C today.Switchcraft’s technology doesn’t just switch you once, they find you a deal every year, so you never overpay again.The £ will be paid into your bank account within  days of completing the switch. *Prepayment meter customers will receive a £ Amazon voucher.

My three children Eddie, , Sammy, , and Annie, nine, do  hours a week of clubs between them, so I spend much of my week as an unpaid driver.With a full-time job and housework to do, a period of self-isolation doesn’t sound so bad.I isolate in Annie’s room. It has a TV, double bed and a desk. I grab my laptop, kettle, toaster, bread and butter, a huge bottle of water, teabags and Pot Noodles and arrange them on a bookcase.As I hear the car pull off outside, I lie down with the book I’ve been trying to finish since Christmas. My eyelids get heavy so I take a nap.The car ing wakes me up. I have a Pot Noodle for lunch and stick on Netflix I never watch.After the family brush their teeth that night I do mine — then I thoroughly clean the bathroom, as per the Government’s advice.That done, I opt for an early night.I WAKE up early and the sun is shining. Normally on a Sunday I would take the dogs for a walk. I’ve already tidied the room top to bottom.When I hear my husband, Jon, surface, I ask for a bowl of cereal. He brings me breakfast and we chat through the door as he makes notes on what to do for Sunday lunch.I amuse myself by doing a jigsaw, watching MasterChef and reading.Social media feels like my only link to the outside world. I find myself constantly looking for #Coronavirus and #Covid.With the kids in bed before school, I phone my mum before going to bed myself.I never struggle to sleep but after zero physical activity, when I lie down my mind whirs with the virus. I check the Government website again. No word on whether to send your kids to school.AFTER a restless night, I am up early with nothing to do and nowhere to go. I watch Sammy play football in the garden and wave as the family head down the driveway to school.I get three texts from the GP, each addressed to one of the kids, saying not to come to the surgerythey have flu-like symptoms but to call , stay indoors and avoid close contact with others.I ask Jon for a boiled egg then shower before cleaning the bathroom again, top to bottom.It has never been so clean.When there is a knock at the door, I go downstairs and try to communicate “self-isolation” to the delivery guy.But he needs a signature and leaves one of those “sorry you weren’t in” cards. I slam the bedroom door.Jon senses I’m in a foul mood so he suggests we eat dinner together — on opposite sides of the door.I DECIDE to do some research away from the internet and call a doctor friend who works at the local hospital.I am becoming increasingly concerned and it doesn’t help that I have only the four walls around me and my laptop. I know I should turn it off but the situation outside is developing so fast.As Jon puts down my lunch of a ham sandwich, I can tell by the slam of the plate he is getting as sick of the experiment as I am.He has done every school run, made every lunch, taken them to their clubs and cooked all of their dinners.I hear him telling them all to wash their hands when they come in from school and a chat with Annie through the door reveals there are hand sanitisers in every classroom and hallway at her school.That is a new development since the start of the week.I DO my usual check to see where the country is with the virus.Having time to think has changed my view.

People’s lives have been completely destroyed.“People are dying every single month by some form of natural disaster created from this huge change in our climate.“So I would love to see an international global law that prevents presidents from cutting down huge forests, the lungs of our earth, and stops them from going back in time to fuel and market that is long gone.“Anything less than that, I don’t see how we can complete this in time before there is a total disaster. I’m a massive believer in anything is possible.“And the more people say no to something, the more we should knuckle down and try and make it happen because, you know,Donald Trump can become President of the United States of America, then anything’s possible, right “Something really drastic needs to happen.“And I think there are some good leaders, political leaders around the world, and at the moment it’s severely unbalanced and in favour of bad leaders.“And now I’m confident within the next five to ten years things will change, but we can’t wait five or ten years.”He also urged “Greta” to meet PM Boris Johnson to push her case.He said: “I think that probably you should add some pressure, and sayyou are willing to make these changes in the United Kingdom, then you will end up having more money to spend on the NHS, for instance.“It comes down to money, and where they can save money, the fact of the matter is you and I know, the more sick our world becomes, the sicker we become.And then the more expensive it is to deal with a world ticking over.”The Prince also revealed he believes British politics is broken and voters were left with a poor choice between Boris and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.He said: “I think again, the fact that our choice was between those two iniduals in my mind, I think, probably creates more of an observation that the system itself might be broken.“So I don’t know, I think that there’s a lot that the leaders of today can learn and can listen to people like yourself.“No one likes to be lectured. No one likes a hypocrite despite the fact that we probably are all hypocrites, apart from you, Greta.”Told on the tape by the hoax “Greta” that Mr Trump, below, had run away from her, Harry replied: “What a surprise.“But Trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won’t want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.“Whether you have an option to meet President Trump or an option to meet Boris Johnson, I think I would always.“It’s far more important to have an open dialogue and have conversation with these people than not.”He said: “I think he is a good man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you.“But you have to understand that because he has been around for so long like all of these other people, they are already set in their ways.“They believe what they want to believe, they believe what they have been told.“What you are now saying to them is not only inconvenient but is completely against everything they have ever believed.“So that is what you’re up against, up against changing habits, as you know.”Harry also defended himself and we Meghan, , after they were criticised by the media for using a private jet to go on holiday while lecturing the world about pollution.And he insisted the couple fly less often than “most people”.He said: “It’s amazing. We get accused by them for having to use a plane that was used simply to get away from them and not be followed for a family break. Unfortunately there is very few alternatives.“We have to fly on commercial planes all over the world. Nowhere near as much as most people who do it for a night or weekends.“We do official overseas visits to Commonwealth countries in support of my grandmother and we have to get there and have to fly, but it is by commercial flights, and occasionally we have to fly privately.“Certainly for my family, to protect my family, from these people, as you can well understand.“I have to put protections and safety of my family first and these people are never-ending.“As I look out the window here, we’ve had boats with paparazzi taking photographs, trying to get photographs of us while we are far, far away in the middle of nowhere.“So they always have a way of finding you. When possible, I will always try and find a means of getting somewhere without them knowing and following us.During the course of the two phone calls, Harry repeatedly suggests meeting up with “Greta” when they are both in America.He said: “I think there is certain things in this world that are inevitable and so much is down to timing.“What I’ve learned over the years is thatyou get the timing right, and the door is open and people at the right moment hear what you have to say, then it’s the right time to strike.“However some things are just inevitable and you just have to accept that some things are going to be the way that they are.“Having focused on the tourism industry to try to save our most valuable ecosystems around the world, I can fully appreciate that the tourism industry is going to — well, people travelling by plane is going to double in the next  years which is a terrying prospect.I myself can’t change that. We can’t stop that from happening. That’s such an enormous trend that is predicted to happen.“So the way that I look at that is, right, well,that’s going to happen, and eco-aviation fuel is going to take so long to bring in, let’s focus on making sure that every single person that does travel is connected to the community on the ground and has a better understanding of how important these ecosystems are to our survival.”Harry also urged “Greta” to never give up.He said: “You have my support or our support in whatever it is you want to carry forward, and I would love to have a discussion, face to face.”Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov — aka Vovan and Lexus — have also duped US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The Russians post their phone chats online and their YouTube channel VCE Pranky has more than , followers.Last month, they convinced Sanders he was chatting to Swedish eco-activist Greta Thunberg.

Iain Duncan Smith warned thereaposs still some more to go as he called for cash on the eve of Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Budget. Ex-Tory leader Sir Iain also renewed calls for the five-week wait for payment to be cut to four and demanded claimants are saved from billions of pounds in debt repayments. Sir Iain resigned in protest at Tory welfare cuts in  - after proudly presiding over them for six years as Work and Pensions Secretary. Although he resigned over disability benefit, he has since also slammed ex-Chancellor George Osborne for making huge cuts before UC was set up. Despite the government making a string of U-turns to make UC more generous - with run-on housing payments, longer debt repayment periods and a shorter wait for payment - Sir Iain said last night it has still not gone far enough. Defending his system overall, he told the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee: There is no question in my mind that Universal Credit is better than the benefits that went before. And he condemned political rivals for using the most vulnerable to stir up an argument. But he added: I resigned over the fact that the government withdrew money at the time we were trying to roll it out, which was a big mistake. Now the government has sought to put most of that money back - there’s still some more to go. Last year the government admitted , people on UC were having old Tax Credit debts deducted from their benefit payment. The overpayments were racked up - sometimes through no fault of their own - before claimants were moved from a HM Revenue and Customs system to the Department for Work and Pensions . At the time the average debt was £,with struggling families losing up to % of their UC each month.Sir Iain said: The number one thing I would do is get rid of the debt that is coming across unnecessarily from Tax Credit. “I did ask the DWP the other day what is the number one thing that you’re concerned about. The number one thing is HMRC have been unable to get this debt back. Sir Iain said he opposed piling the debt onto UC claimants at the time, but I had to cave in on that eventually because I was under pressure across the board. He added: HMRC should retain that debt, decide that they’re going to do with it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"arcade owner puts toilet rolls","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Arcade owner puts toilet rolls and hand sanitiser in grab machinesRob Braddick of Ho Barts Amusement Arcade in Westward Ho!, North Devon hoped that people would flock to his amusement arcade when they got desperate amid the coronavirus panic buyingShareCommentsByJoel CooperJoseph WilkesReporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video arcade-fills-grabber-machine-toilet-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,: JOHN CROSS REACT,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror sport football video rb-leipzig---spurs-,articleUrl:,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  deb-e-f-aac-edeacc bffdb-dcb-bf-ba-bfddd x match image.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news arcade-owner-puts-toilet-rolls-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

British Airways, Ryanair and Wizz have all shut off their routes to Italy for several weeks, after the Foreign Office warned against all but essential advice. But some Brits due to fly out for holidays to Italy this week are still set to lose money. EasyJet has cancelled flights to northern Italy but other routes are still running. It currently is not planning to refund or rebook customers on existing flights to Italy that havenapost been cancelled.Ryanair had initially also refused to refund customers but this afternoon annonced it was suspending flights to Italy and offering refunds in some cases.But the airlineaposs decision has left some travellers with holidays booked this week in the lurch - as they learn the refunds only kick in from Friday despite Italy being in lockdown.

The airline said that affected passengers have been contacted by email regarding the cancellations.As for passengers looking for repatriation, Ryanair is offering a free move to an earlier one of its flights operating until midnight on Friday March .Affected passengers will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next  months.

Mr Lawrence told thehad already spent more than an hour on hold to the airline this morning in hopes of finding a solution, but said his hopes were fading with just days before they were due to fly. He said: It’s absolutely ridiculous. How can you continue to run flights to a country on lockdown without offering a refund  To some extent you know what you are getting in to when you book with a low-cost airline but this is way beyond the line. Scandalous.” He said the coupleaposs flights with the budget airline had cost about £, but it was the principle of the matter that left them feeling frustrated as he said other travel operators had acted fairly.  Mr Lawrence said the coupleaposs Airbnb host in Florence had offered the couple a full refund even before north Italyaposs quarantine extended to the rest of the country. Airbnb had also waived its fees, Mr Lawrence said.

While the Government has been slammed for failing to focus on GP surgeries amid the spread as patients with diabetes and long-term heart and lung problems face missing out on crucial appointments. Richard Vautrey, chairman of the BMA GPs committee, told the BBC cases of Covid- are anticipated to rise rapidly in the coming weeks. This could lead to increased waiting times for patients with mild health conditions and is likely to continue for at least a few weeks,not months, he warned. We will need to stop doing much of the routine work that we do week-by-week to enable us to focus on the sickest patients and prioritise those who most need us, Dr Vautrey said.Practices that are routinely doing routine health checks, assessing blood pressure , diabetic control, and long-term problems with heart and lung disease - those routine checks will need to stop.Dr Vautrey said GPs will need to prioritise not only those with potential coronavirus, but also the sickest patients who need continuous care. He said: It does mean that some patients may have to wait longer than normal to see their GP. Itaposs likely to continue for at least a few weeks,not months. And itaposs quite possible that there will be more than one wave of infection.  It comes after three-quarters of  GPs surveyed by GPonline said routine appointments should be suspended in the event of a widespread coronavirus outbreak. One in five thought this should happen now, in the survey published on Monday. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitionerscriticised the Government for being insufficiently focused on GP surgeries amid the outbreak.  Professor Martin Marshall told Londonwide LMCs conference on Tuesday he had been inundated with emails from GPs concerned about a lack of information. Overall it feels like the Government are doing a reasonable job, but it does feel that they are more focused on hospitals and much more focused on NHS  and insufficiently focused on general practice, he said. General practice is going to start feeling the pressure probably in quite a signicant way.

Experts are warning the three signs to watch out for are: a cough, a high temperature, and shortness of breath. But the new findings suggest workmates, family-members and classmates could be at risk for a full working week - before a virus carrier was even aware they had the infection. The study says infected iniduals should expect to begin feeling unwell within  days - although in rare cases the incubation period can last longer, reports Devon Live. The findings support current recommendations introduced in countries including the UK to isolate those who may have been exposed to Covid- for  days. Five people in the UK have died after contracting the virus, and the number infected has now hit  - with the total rising daily. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true\" Italy has imposed strict lockdown measures on its population amid a major outbreak in the country, as the global case count tops ,. Brits are being warned to avoid all but essential travel to the country, as the death toll climbs. Study senior author professor Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US, said: Based on our analysis of publicly available data, the current recommendation of  days for active monitoring or quarantine is reasonable.  But he added: With that period some cases would be missed over the long-term. The latest study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine - the most extensive of its kind - analysed  provinces, regions and countries outside Wuhan, China, where the disease emerged. It reviewed news reports, public health papers and press releases to estimate theof time from exposure to the onset of symptoms. The US team found information on  confirmed cases prior to  February where incubation windows could be identied - the time from exposure to symptom onset. They said: Most involved travel to or from Wuhan, China, the city at the centre of the epidemic, or exposure to iniduals who had been to Hubei, the province for which Wuhan is the capital.  This enabled them to estimate an average period of . days. Current understanding of this has been limited. Prof Lessler said: Human coronaviruses that cause common colds have mean illness-incubation periods of about three days. Almost allpatients appeared to develop symptoms within . days of infection. Prof Lessler said: These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, only  out of every , cases will develop symptoms after  days of active monitoring or quarantine, which supports current CDC recommendations. The US Centres for Disease Control and Preventionadvises active monitoring of people for  days after an assumed exposure to COVID-.  Many other authorities around the world - including Public Health England - have been using the same guide for those known to be at high risk of infection due to contact with patients or travel to a heavily affected area. The illness usually spreads through droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viral particles may be breathed in, land on surfaces that people touch or be transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has the virus. Often itaposs obviousa person is unwell. But there are cases where those who do not feel sick pass it on. Exactly how this happens - and how often - is not yet known.  Regular handwashing and avoiding touching your mouth, nose and eyes are likely to help stop the spread of the virus. Quarantines and travel restrictions are now in place in many counties - including the US. COVID- is largely a respiratory virus. Common symptoms include a fever, dry coughing and trouble breathing. But there have been some reports of nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea. In some cases it can cause pneumonia and potentially be le-threatening. Most people who get sick will recover from COVID-. Recovery time ies and, for people who are not severely ill, may be similar to the aftermath of flu. People with mild symptoms may recover within a few days. It may take weeks or even months for those who develop pneumonia. Prof Lessler added: An accurate estimate of the disease incubation period for a new virus makes it easier for epidemiologists to gauge the likely dynamics of the outbreak, and allows public health officials to design effective quarantine and other control measures.

However according to experts it wasnapost exactly a joyful reunion, and the Sussexesapos final engagement was said to be marred with tensions behind the scenes. But that didnapost stop Kate and William from marking the historical occasion by sharing a series of photos on social media, including separate pictures of Meghan and Harry. While they didnapost mention anything about the importance of the event, fans were quick to praise them for their sweet gesture. The first photo shows Kate and William walking out of the abbey, followed by a lovely photo of the Queen.The next shows Prince Charles and Camilla followed by a snap of Meghan chatting to boxing legend Anthony Joshua . There is also a photo of Prince Harry fist bumping Craig David, a nod to the ban on handshaking amid the Coronavirus crisis, and a picture of his uncle Prince Edward with his we Sophie Wessex.Their caption read: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined The Queen and Members of  @TheRoyalFamily  for the annual  #CommonwealthDay  Service at Westminster Abbey. The Commonwealth represents a global network of  countries working in collaboration towards shared economic, environmental, social and democratic goals — the Commonwealth theme for  is Delivering A Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming.

As Head, Her Majesty personally reinforces the links by which the Commonwealth joins people together from around the world. From working to protect the earthaposs natural resources and preserving the planet for generations to come, to championing fair trade and empowering the youth of today to transform the communities of tomorrow, this year’s Service celebrated the Commonwealthaposs continued commitment to delivering a peaceful, prosperous and more sustainable future for all.  Commenting on the Sussex and Cambridge reunion, body language expert Judi James tolddescribed it was a rather odd greeting ritual. She said: Harry and Meghan looked a lot more genuinely cheerful, and Harry especially, through a really affectionate smile at Kate.  But when it was William, you could see Harry was slightly more rigid and his lips were closed. Speaking more generally about Meghan and Harry at the event, she said: It wasnapost the warm reunion that we were all hoping for. The tension in Harryaposs body language especially was palpable.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhether you fall victim to coronavirus or not, the outbreak is guaranteed to affect your le. Our readers are quite rightly demanding to know what the Government and big organisations are doing. So here is our at-a-glance guide to the impact the crisis is having... and what might be coming next. Schools Heads are under pressure from health officials to stay open.Shutting schools would have a huge impact on parents, public services and thewider economy.China, where the outbreak started, took the drastic step of closing all schools and colleges. Italy, too, has closed schools and universities – and cancelled exams. Here, all efforts are being made to stick to the timetable for GSCEs and A-levels. Delaying A-levels in particular could have a big knock-on impact on university admissions. The Government says school closures are possible as part of “population distancing strategies” to slow the spread of the disease – although there are no immediate plans to do so. Hospitals Measures to limit the risk of face-to-face contact in GP surgeries and hospitals include using more phone appointments and video calls.NHS chiefs are trying to push the outbreak’s peak towards the summer, hoping the warm weather will lessen the impact and let hospitals recover from winter.But they have warned that dealing with urgent cases could mean other services being reduced temporarily. That could result in routine ops like hip replacements being cancelled to free up beds for Covid- victims. Public transport  Public Health England says there are currently no specic concerns about using public transport. Restrictions could be imposed but it might depend where you are. It could be tied in with advice for people to work from home where possible. Previous research suggested London Underground commuters are more at risk of catching respiratory illnesses. Transport for London has upped its cleaning of Tube trains and buses. And Network Rail says cleaning of “high-touch areas” in stations has been stepped up. The Government is not recommending staff on public transport wear face masks. But PHE says they should avoid close contact with anyone who may be infected. Mortgages  Royal Bank of Scotland has confirmed customers affected by coronavirus can defer mortgage or loan repayments for up to three months. Rival TSB is offering a mortgage holiday of up to two months and both are allowing savers with fixed rate accounts to get their money early without a penalty. Trade body UK Finance said all banks would consider loan and mortgage holidays, and increasing overdrafts, for those whose incomes take a hit from the outbreak. Stock market turbulence due to Covid- led to the black hole in UK company pension schemes ballooning from £billion to £bn last month. Airlines  British Airways has suspended all flights to Italy until April . Budget rival easyJet is doing the same, until April , and is operating “rescue flights” for passengers already there. Ryanair is halting services to and from Italy until April . Passengers on cancelled flights should be entitled to refunds. No-frills carrier Norwegian is preparing to cancel around , flights between mid-March and mid-June and temporarily laying off a “signicant” chunk of staff. Trade body Airports Council International said the outbreak was “turning into a shock of unprecedented proportions”. It fears passenger numbers through European airports could plunge by  million this year. If there is a rapid rise in Covid- cases here, other countries could advise against all but essential travel to the UK. Pubs and hotels  Advice to work from home has hit trade in city centre pubs, with the number of drinkers down up to % in some areas. UK Hospitality said “it’s assomebody flipped a switch”, with once buzzing bars now deserted. But while high street pubs suffer, locals are getting trade from remote workers who head to the corner boozer for a pint rather than travel to town. And bookings for events, conferences and hotel rooms have slumped by % for the next two to three weeks as people avoid large gatherings. Should the virus spread, pubs may be forced to impose a ft exclusion zone between drinkers and have last orders at pm. And there could be a ban on screening live sports to keep numbers down. Hotels are riding the storm but want emergency measures such as a VAT cut or a business rates holiday of up to six months for security. Care homes  As yet, just one care home has closed its doors to visitors. Sunningdale in Tamworth, Staffs, acted after a case of coronavirus was confirmed at a nearby school. Fears of a signicant number of workers having to self-isolate has led to talks between the Government and care home bosses over how they could fill the void. There are around . million carers in Britain and a major outbreak could put , in self-isolation. The Department of Health is looking into suggestions that background checks for workers who have close physical contact with vulnerable people be relaxed. This could extend to those who have left care work or retired being drafted back in without the usual y wait for approval. Care homes are already asking relatives to think twice about visiting and urging families to stay in touch with their loved ones by phone. But all visits could be bannedthe outbreak escalates. Supermarkets  Tesco has already imposed rationing on certain items, with shoppers limited to five packs of baked beans, pasta, longle milk, tinned veg and bleach. It is the only chain to ration food but rivals are restricting shoppers to how many toiletries they can buy. The Co-op has a limit of three on packs of loo rolls, hand sanitiser, antibacterial soap and hand and surface wipes. Aldi has clamped down on loo rolls, allowing one pack per person, and is also rationing hand sanitisers, as are Boots, Asda, Iceland and Waitrose. Morrisons is limiting us to six bottles of bleach and Sainsbury’s has a three-pack limit on soap, handwash and tissues. With shoppers ignoring advice and stockpiling staples, the Government has lted the late-night curfew on delivery lorries. And supermarkets are urging friends, family and neighbours of vulnerable, elderly folk who have to self-isolate to help do their shopping.  Sport  Sporting events are currently unaffected by restrictions here, although away European footie clashes are to be played behind closed doors.Bayern Munich and Cha’s Champions League match will be played without fans, as will Manchester United ’s Europa League tie with LASK.There is talk of banning over-s – the biggest risk group – from football matches, which could hit Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson, pictured, who is . England’s friendly against Italy at Wembley on March  is at risk and while there are no plans to cancel Wimbledon, tennis bosses will offer refundsit is affected. Cheltenham is still on but the racing festival is not a sell-out. All domestic sport has been banned in Italy until April  and top-flight French football is to be played behind closed doors or no more than , spectators. If the Government follows suit and bans crowds at sporting events, pay-to-view broadcasters could be asked to screen live matches or highlights for free. Religion  Churches, synagogues and mosques are telling worshippers to follow Government advice on “good hygiene practice”. The Church of England said communion would only be banned in areas where there were high cases of infection. Peace handshakes and the laying on of hands would also be suspended. All churches have been urged to install hand sanitisers. Synagogues have banned handshakes and kissing the holy book, and are asking worshippers to set up “telephone trees” to keep tabs on each other – with eight people phoning eight others and so on.

One was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity, she said. But the affairs ended in heartbreak when one of her lovers murdered the other in a chilling revenge attack.Natalie was having secret affairs with both Alan Maidment, , and Tom Jones,  – at the same time as she was sleeping with her husband.But after Jones attacked Natalie, Maidment murdered him in revenge, stabbing him repeatedly before setting his body on fire. Maidment was jailed for le without parole in October . And an independent review, published this week, has found that lessons from the case could still be learned. Natalie, , from Salford, says: “I actually introduced the two men to each other and I feel so guilty.“I never set out to sleep with them all at the same time it was just circumstance. They all lived so close and it was amazing that I got away with it. “Each lover brought me something dferent one was passion and physical attraction, one was friendship and fun, one stability and familiarity.“I was arrested on suspicion of murder after Tom’s death and in court, Alan even tried to blame me himself. “I didn’t know about the review but it has brought all the trauma back to me. “I am very lucky in that my husband has supported me and I’m back living in the family home. I hope we can work this out.“But the flat where Tom died is across the road and so I see it, every time I leave the house. It’s a constant reminder. I’ve had a backlash from the community too, some people somehow blame me. It’s been a struggle to cope, and this review brings it all back.”Natalie was on a temporary split from her husband, Paul, when she met Alan Maidment in July .Natalie says: “Paul and I had been together for eighteen years, mostly happy. But I was drinking too much and we went through a rocky patch. We decided on a break and I met Alan, firstly just as a friend, but then we got closer.”At the start of , Natalie believed she needed a fresh start and moved into her own place, around the corner from her husband. Alan moved away and she began seeing a neighbour, Tom Jones.She says: “We were just friends at first. My relationship with Alan petered out because I hardly saw him. He lived around  minutes away.“One night, after a few drinks, I ended up in bed with Tom and from then on, we started sleeping together. We weren’t in a serious relationship more friends with benefits. We shared a flat and we shared a bed. “I knew it wasn’t the best situation but I certainly didn’t think it would lead to his death.” Alan then decided to move closer to Natalie – and got a flat just a few streets away.Natalie says: “Alan didn’t know I had been sleeping with Tom. He moved in near me and our relationship resumed. I didn’t know how to tell him about Tom so I just kept quiet.“I was sleeping with both men.” Natalie also slept with her husband during that time, in an attempt to rescue her marriage.She says: “I was very confused I didn’t know what I wanted. I had three men, all living within a few streets of each other, who all wanted to be with me. “One brought me passion, one gave me friendship, the other stability. I felt like I got something special from each of them. “Alan was passionate and dangerous he was a brilliant lover. Tom was friendly and fun, he made me laugh and we got on so well. My husband was familiar and we had such a lot of history together. “I suppose it was flattering but more than anything, I didn’t want to hurt anyone. I was worried about hurting their feelings.“But I couldn’t even nip to the shop without bumping into one of them. I had to be very careful.”That Christmas, Natalie decided to end the relationship with Alan, but agreed that they would remain friends. She also agreed with her husband that they would separate formally and their relationship ended. She says: “I had decided to choose Tom. I hoped the others would understand.”But in March , Natalie and Tom had a huge row. He allegedly beat her up and was arrested.Natalie says: “It was a huge shock. Tom had never hurt me before. He was arrested and I went to hospital. For me, it was over. “Afterwards, I went to stay with a female friend.” The following morning, Natalie was arrested on suspicion of murdering Tom, . She says: “I was shell-shocked. I’d had no idea that Tom was even dead. To learn he had been murdered was heart-breaking.”Officers at first thought that Natalie had murdered Tom herself, in revenge for the attack on her. But she was released without charge after questioning.The following day, Alan Maidment was charged with Tom’s murder. Natalie says: “I was stunned. As far as I’d known there was no problem between Alan and Tom – their only connection was me. I couldn’t help feeling guilty – responsible for Tom’s death. “Alan had murdered Tom on my behalf – as revenge. It was sickening. “Tom deserved punishment for hitting me, but he did not deserve such a brutal death.” Alan Maidment appeared before Manchester crown Court in October . The court was told that Mr Jones was stabbed  times before his body was set on fire. The court heard Maidment acted in ‘revenge’ after hearing of what had apparently happened to Natalie, who it was said he still occasionally had sex with despite splitting up earlier in the year.The court was told that Mr Jones was arrested by police in connection with the alleged assault, but was released after Natalie stated she did not wish to press charges.Mr Jones had accused Natalie, who he had an on-off sexual relationship with while living in separate rooms of his flat, of sleeping with other men. Maidment initially confessed to police, saying he had committed the murder in revenge after hearing that Mr Jones had assaulted Natalie.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came face-to-face with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry publicly for the first time since the Sussexes announced their plans to quit the Royal Family. But Meghan and Harryaposs final outing - the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey - was reportedly marred by tensions behind the scenes. The couple were said to be upset and emotional after learning they couldnapost be part of the Queenaposs procession at the start of the service, instead being shown to their seats with the rest of the the guests. But in a bid to avoid any more drama, Prince William and Kate made a last minute change to try and ease the tension, reports the Daily Mail . The couple offered to join Meghan and Harry in skipping the procession, meaning they all waited for the service to start in their seats. The decision was only made on Sunday, after the order of services were printing - meaning they were incorrect. However their gesture reportedly didnapost work, and their meeting seemed slightly awkward as both couples took their seats.  The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didnapost stand to greet them. Last year Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved yesterday. While it wouldnapost have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive.  Meghan, who was already sitting down, can be seen saying hello and giving an awkward wave. Harry also says hello, but that was as far of their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his we. Sophie Wessex, who is sitting behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess, while Harry and Meghan chatted to Prince Edward.

The opportunity to demonstrate a real commitment to supporting vulnerable sectors and jobs during the Covid- outbreak, but also to kick-starting the economy when it’s over. In the face of a perfect storm of post-Brexit uncertainty, economic downturn and coronavirus, ministers have it in their power to avoid a tsunami of job losses on our high streets, in our struggling manufacturing industries and regional airports and their supply chains. Yet this government talks the talk of levelling up the regions of this country, but seems incapable of learning the lessons of past failure. It doesn’t walk the walk to preserve industries and protect local economies. Flybe’s collapse is testimony to government inaction to protect regional economies and seize opportunities. Rishi Sunak, working people need to hear measures from you to boost regional development, including house building, electric vehicle charging networks and battery production facilities, investment in skills, green technology and jobs. With our aviation and manufacturing sectors in crisis and thousands of jobs at stake, continued inaction simply isn’t an option. With the future of some regional airports now hanging by a thread, the fears of the industry’s workforce can be allayed with a delay in the payment of airline taxes and duties and the extension of loans to airlines and airports so they can retain staff and routes until bookings recover. There must also be subsidies for the key routes tied to long-term environmental commitments as part of an integrated, sustainable transport network.  What better way than to demonstrate the government’s commitment to building connectivity between far-flung parts of our nations and our metropolitan cities  For manufacturing, we desperately need intervention and investment in our infrastructure to revive the fortunes of our left-behind industrial heartlands – those very heartlands that voted for the Tories last December. Yet the long-awaited -year National Infrastructure Strategy with its £ billion of capital investment that was to be published alongside the Budget has been postponed.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe parents of a one-year-old boy with a rare skin condition are so distraught by cruel trolls they avoid going out in public. Toddler Logan Webb has Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes liver damage and bile to be absorbed by the body and makes his skin turn yellow. His mum Gemma Channing, , and dad Lloyd Webb, , say his appearance makes it impossible to have a normal day out and that rude strangers have even called him a minion baby. Others have told the couple, from Exeter, that he looks jaundiced, or like Shrek or the Grinch. I always have people asking me whataposs wrong with him and that I should take him to hospital because he has jaundice, Gemma says. We get lots of people saying negative things such as asking why he looks like a minion and that he looks like Shrek or the Grinch. Every time we go out as a family thereaposs a constant reminder about Loganaposs condition. We canapost just leave the house and have a normal day out, we have to be stopped and reminded by someone about how poorly he is. On one occasion, a stranger even insisted that Gemma should immediately take her son to hospital.  We were in Sainsburyaposs with Logan doing a quick food shop and minding our own business, she explains. We got into the car and were about to drive off when a woman started banging on the window. Rather than asking us about Logan she had called a paramedic who happened to be in the car park to assess Logan. She then proceeded to tell us that we should take Logan to the hospital as he was clearly unwell. We tried to explain to her that he is being cared for and has a complex condition. She just stood there and said itwas her son sheaposd take him to hospital. The paramedic understood what we were saying but it was so embarrassing. We have horrible comments and questions whenever we leave the house. Sometimes it just breaks your heart.  Logan was diagnosed with Alagille syndrome soon after he was born in December . His parents have to give him a daily dosage of  dferent medications, as the condition means his liver doesnapostproperly and that his blood is only half oxygenated. Because his liver canapost process the bile in his body, it becomes absorbed into his skin, causing burning and itching as well as turning his skin yellow. His heart and liver defects also mean Logan canapost absorb food properly, so he is still only the size of a six-month-old baby even at the age of one.  The youngster is constantly in and out of hospital, which can be a traumatic ordeal, Gemma says.

Melissa Ryan claims she was pressured into getting her brows laminated by a member of staff who aposwasnapost fully qualiedapos - both of which the salon denies - after she had a lip filler treatment yesterday. She blasted Kent business Cavendish Aesthetics, saying aposshe could have done a better job blindfoldedapos.The owner of the parlour has hit back claiming she offered to thin her brows after the treatment, Kent Live reports, adding that she had been subjected to social media abuse following the complaint. The -year-old posted a description of her experience and a picture of her eyebrows on Facebook , with more than , people sharing her status.It has sparked hundreds of comments in response. But now the owner, Amanda Cavendish, has spoken out against the constant barrage of abuse she says she has received. The business owner, , claimed she has received more than  messages in the wake of the viral post. She even says she has reported the alleged harassment to the police, who have been contacted for comment. Part of Melissaaposs post read: Amanda has dealt with a situation highly unprofessionally. I had my lips done today, they were fine I couldn’t fault her on that. Then whilst having my lips done I was offered to have my eyebrows laminated and tinted, I felt a bit put on the spot as you do when people try to up sell, but askedthis treatment would suit me and both Amanda and her colleagueagreed I’d look great, so I agreed to have it.  My eyebrows were completely unsatisfactory and nothing like the photos that are advertised on social media. I was left looking like I complete fool. I probably could’ve done a better job myself blindfolded. I don’t like to publish my confidence issues to other people but I literally came home and cried, this has made me feel even worse about myself and my appearance. I was allowed to leave the shop with my eyebrows in the worst state possible, people in public were staring at me and laughing me, it was so embarrassing! About half an hour after leaving, Melissa decided to contact the salon to air her concerns, but claims she was dealt with completely unprofessionally. She initially askedwashing the tint off would ruin the whole lamination, to which Amanda replied, telling her to keep them dry for at least  hours. But after another hour, Melissa sent a series of messages, getting more and more concerned about her eyebrows. Amanda, who is qualied to level seven masters in aesthetics, eventually offered a refund, but said Melissa did not turn up at the salon to collect her £ and instead wanted the money via bank transfer. Melissa says this is because her journey cost from Orpington to Ashford would render this entirely redundant. Amanda told KentLive: “It’s not a good idea for me to be responding to bullying, hate speech vulgarity on social media but I do want to put my side across.  “I’ve had over  vile harassing, hateful things said about me. “Staff are worried that someone will come in and cause problems, I’ve had clients cancel today. “I donapost want to have anyone here put at risk. “My husband is in work in London worried sick. “And the police are now involved – all because one person complained.” Amanda says her regular clients have been quick to support the salon, which has three employees. She also said she wasnapost worried about the future of her business amid the social media uproar. “If you look, before the last few days, I do not have one bad review,” she added. “I’m very well known in Ashford and,anything, I hope this will raise my profile. “I donapost pressure anyone into doing anything in my salon and my clients will tell you that.”  Amanda says she clearly explained Melissaaposs treatment was being done by someone in training. This is something Melissa strenuously denies. “All I said at the time was, ‘we do brow lamination, you’ve got lovely big brows, would you like to have your brows laminated ’ “I explained that we were looking for models at the moment, for someone in training, and askedshe would be happy to help. “She said ‘go on then why not’ - those were her words.” The brow lamination was booked in around an hour later, with Melissa heading to the Ashford Designer Outlet for some shopping while she waited. After the treatment was done, Amanda said she explained to her client how the staining of the skin was to be expected. She added: “I said the tint has stained your skin but thataposs normal, you have to keep them dry for  hours, after that you can wet your brows all that staining will come off. “I asked ‘are you happy with what we’ve done  Because I feel you need to have your brows thinned out in the arch area.’  “And she said she didn’t want any off because someone had over-plucked them previously. “We agreed on this but I did say, ‘next time you come back to us you need to think about having your brow arch shaped.’” Melissa said her skin had become irritated and itchy after the treatment and insisted in her post she should have been offered a patch test beforehand. But Amanda claims the products she uses, made by a company called BOM, are “very mild” and only need a patch testthe person involved has pre-existing skin sensitivity or allergies. On the state of Melissaaposs brows in the images, Amanda admitted they didnapost look perfect. She explained: “Looking at them I would say that she’s justied in what she’s saying.

The -year-old has since made a habit of exposing the crude advances she receives and shares her hilarious tactic to deal with them on her own aposJenni Vs Creepy Inbox Guysapos page - which now has , followers. In one conversation, a man asked to see a pictures of Jenner in her underwear, so she sent back a close up of what appeared to be her cleavage. When he replied aposMMMM that just helped me finish babe you got nice t***apos, she sent the full zoomed out image, showing it was in fact a man holding a bra in front of his butt cheeks with the message: You just tugged the slug over some man crack you thirsty freak. Jenner, a bank worker from Merseyside, says her husband hates the messages and wishes she would block them - but she hopes calling them out will stop them going on to harass other women. My absolute favourite reply of all time is when I was sent a d*** pic and I replied, aposthat d*** pic just gave me an STDapos. He said, aposyou donapost get STDs from pics, stupidapos. I said, aposIaposm not talking about a sexually transmitted disease. I meant a Small Todger Disappointmentapos. That really cracked me up. I do save any photos I see on the net in advance that maybe have some use in following someone sending me unsolicited DMs.  I found the guyaposs a**cheek picture made to look like cleavage online. But when it comes to my actual text replies, Iaposm pretty quick-witted and itaposs all done on the fly in response to how they reply and what is said to me first. I do get a lot of messages so recalling exact thought processes during inidual chats is dficult, but I felt intense excitement, pleasure and satisfaction as I sent the first fake cleavage picture. I knew he was about to be embarrassed beyond belief. I have a decent following on the page, but Iaposm still a down-to-earth person and donapost consider myself an expert or above anyone .

Saves me doing it haha I hope my no-nonsense approach rubs off on my followers, spreading the culture of not taking c**p from guys who donapost want to respect womenaposs boundaries. My method of humiliating presents the tiniest chance that they may think twice before doing it again. Plus, itaposs hilarious my way, so thereaposs that. Jenner says most guys find her profile as she is the admin of a few online groups, where she regularly contributes. When she received her first ever message, she responded to say she was married and not interested, only to be given a barrage of abuse in .  I had a lightbulb moment and realised I could play with the situation and haze any future unsolicited message sendersthey got pervy without provocation, she said.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAlex Porro battled weight problems all his le - admitting he was always picked last for PE and was too ashamed to learn to ride a bike. The -year-old was once so heavy he could not be weighed on conventional scales and had to use industrial ones. Doctors warned him thathe didnapost lose weight, his le would be at risk. Alex weighed more than  stone but now Alex has shed a massive  stone and is completely unrecognisable. Once too nervous to use a gym, Alex now gets up at am every day to work out and has completely overhauled his diet. Alex, from South Florida, said: There are a lot of things that I always knew I couldnapost do or I shouldnapost do, just knowing the weight that I was at but since Iaposve lost the weight, Iaposve accepted so many challenges. I did a Spartan Race, which is an obstacle race with a three-mile run in it. Iaposm  years old, I just learned how to ride a bike this year. Just because I was always bullied and picked on being the fat kid getting on the bike falling off. And doing CrossFit. The gym used to make me uncomfortable. Now Iaposm doing CrossFit every morning at am. Describing himself as “the big kid in class”, Alex added: Iaposve always had a problem with my weight. I was always picked last at gym and my weight just started to spiral and get out of hand right after high school when I just slowly became less and less active. Growing up in a Latin family, dinner times were a big feature with plenty of food and everyone expected to clear their plate. Alex, who admits the concept of a calorie used to be alien to him, said: Food was always a comfort as it is for a lot of people, I just abused it. And I was just eating all the wrong stuff in all the wrong amounts, just drinking  packs of Mountain Dew, eating tons of Oreos, pizza, Chinese buffet, ice cream, you name it, and I was just eating it and overindulging. I just had no knowledge of what calories or what eating all these foods was doing besides making my weight go up. By the time he was , a doctor had warned Alexhe didnapost shed the pounds, he would die.  Alex said: For my yearly check-in, the doctor actually told meI didnapost lose weight, I wasnapost going to live to see . But Alex didn’t take notice and put on so much weight he couldn’t weigh himself on domestic scales. Then one day, while making a delivery to a warehouse for his courier job, he decided to stand on the industrial pallet scale. He said: I never knew the exact weight that I was at because my doctor’s scale every year would only go up to  pounds, so it was always a guessing game. I was making a delivery to a warehouse in Deerfield, and it just so happened they had a pallet scale. Just out of curiosity, I stepped on and I was shocked. But also knew that it wasnapost a lie, that I was near lbs. When I stepped on the pallet scale and saw lbs, I completely shut down. I donapost even think I finished that day of work. I went home and completely threw out everything in my fridge that I knew was the problem the pizzas, the doughnuts, the soda, the Oreos, everything. And knowing that Iaposm an adult now, this is my le, it can either end really soon or I could start taking care of myself. It was all on me. In the first month he lost lbs just by ditching all liquid calories and only drinking water and a diet of chicken, broccoli and rice cakes.Alex also found a community of supporters on Instagram as well as being given practical advice and tips from family and friends.He said: I found a lot of pages that were just proof that you could do it naturally a lot of people were like me and I just followed pages that had cheat sheets for meal preps and dferent workout routines. I never had a trainer, I never had a nutritionist. The lowest weight Alex hit was lbs but as he has started to build up muscle he now fluctuates between -lbs. He said: I currently work out six to seven days a week. Every so often I will do a two-day. I do CrossFit every morning at am. With such a large amount of weight lost Alex has been left with a substantial amount of excess skin. He said: I lost lbs so I have a lot of loose skin in my gut area. However, I was able to shape and sculpt my arms and my back pretty tight. But in my gut and my thighs, I carry a lot of loose skin.

More than  people have now died of COVD- in the country, while British Airways and Ryanair have cancelled all international flights to and from the nation as it remains on entire lockdown. Our video journalist Hannah Dodd writes this chilling first-person account from Rome, where the tourism industry has taken the devastating impact. As she reports, the mighty Colosseum is closed, supermarkets are bare and loved ones canapost hold hands in what is one of the most romantic cities in the world... For live updates on coronavirus, visit our blog  We arrived in Rome on Saturday morning and it’s beyond belief how quickly the virus has taken the city. On our first day, the Trevi fountain, though quieter than usual, was still awash with tourists taking selfies, and sellers touting ponchos for the thunderstorms. By Sunday, the mighty Colosseum has fallen to COVD- .  Tourists were told they could not enter the interior to contain the spread of the virus, and the Roman forum was snapped up tight.It felt like swimming the channel only to be turned away at Normandy. By Monday, the line for the basilica was still as impressive as ever, though the bag scanners sat hauntingly empty and the Sistine Chapel was closed too. Monday evening, the full lockdown came into place and overnight bustling Rome fell practically silent. Tuesday morning saw empty shelves in pharmacies and supermarkets, no masks no sanitiser and yellow chalk lines around check outs so you didn’t stand too close to the cashiers.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/19893463-859x564.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 ayr hemmings and crankshaw goals see dark blues leapfrog honest men","story":"A FIFTH clean sheet on the bounce saw Dundee move into third spot after a deserved - victory over Ayr United at Dens Park.The Dark Blues stretched their unbeaten run to six matches as they saw off the Honest Men thanks to Kane Hemmings# th-minute opener and Olly Crankshaw#s first for the club.There were two changes to the Dundee starting XI as Christie Elliott replaced Cammy Kerr at right wing-back while Andrew Nelson came in for Jordan McGhee, who hadn#t recovered from a dead leg picked up against the Honest Men on Saturday.Goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was missing from the squad after his we gave birth on Monday night.

We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

American.And although some may only know the titular song, Anything Goes, audiences are bound to fall in love with the equally tuneful I Get a Kick Out of You and Blow, Gabriel, Blow.If the classic showtunes werent enough to whet your theatre appetite, the amazing cast of this production will certainly capture your attention.Donning the flapper style, each cast member brings their own flair to their roles.Anything Goes star-crossed lovers, Hope Harcourt and Billy Crocker, played by Catriona Lamb and Jack McAuley show that even when apart, their characters determination to be together couldnt be stopped by those who would stand in their way. Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

George Osborne used the Gladstone box for his first Budget in .vw,vw,px, px\"At one of his Budgets in the early s, Norman Lamont held aloft a red box containing a bottle of whisky, rather than his speech ndash Is it true the Chancellor can drink alcohol during the Budget speech Yes. By tradition, this is the only occasion when a minister can drink alcohol at the despatch box. Gladstone drank sherry with a beaten egg and Benjamin Disraeli had brandy. Geoffrey Howe in the s preferred gin and tonic and Kenneth Clarke whisky, but more recent chancellors Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond have all drunk water.When Norman Lamont held up his red box for photographers before one of his Budgets in the early s, unbeknown to them it contained only a bottle of Highland Park whisky, with the crucial statement instead carried by aide William Hague ndash who went on to become Tory leader..\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"William Gladstone delivered the longest continuous Budget speech ndash What are the longest and shortest speeches Disraelirsquos  statement took five hours, but he had a break.

was forced to U-turn over his so-called ldquopasty tax in  in order to quell a backbench rebellion, while Philip Hammond scrapped plans to increase self-employed National Insurance contributions after being accused of breaking a manesto pledge.But Mr Sunak, whatever he announces in his speech in the House of Commons on Wednesday, will have gone one better than his predecessor Sajid Javid, who

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

And visually, perhaps its blueness: indigo lighting that makes a feature of the bar, those azure blue tiles bathed in turquoise light, and the leggy bar chairs all stop the interior looking humdrum.The menu here wakes up my jaded palate. So often you read a menu once, find nothing much that you fancy, then scrutinise it again, trying to make the best of a bad job. Not here.

Inside this delicate crust the meat comes away in tender shreds.: Zinfandel Gastro Bar, Nithsdale Road, Glasgow. Restaurant review by Ron MackennaAngularly cut caullower, roasted to just the right point where itrsquos definitely cooked, but not mushy, is distinguished from some wannabe Ottolenghi effort by its flavour-loaded smoked cheese velouteacute. A smidgen of date jam, a quivering confit egg yolk also make the brassica more unctuous, while a snowfall of crispy fried onions adds contrasting texture. How good is this lamb rump  Maybe at this time of year it almost qualies as hogget, meat from older, more mature sheep. Certainly its intrinsic flavour is there in force, and itrsquos so pink and dreamily tender. A star in and of itself, the lamb comes with salt-baked beetroot that taste exceptionally of themselves, amber-crusted potatoes- in a sort of pommes Anna treatment, only made with duck fat rather than butter- with smoked whipped feta, and a judicious amount of black olive crumb layering on salty savouriness. A phenomenal plateful for pound, substantial enough to be a main course, and given the high cost of lamb, a definite bargain.lsquoGelrsquo  That words usually worries me, but this pearly cod in its IPA batter that comes with a lemon rendition converts me to the G word itrsquos strikingly right with the deep-fried fish.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake.

The accusers in sexual assault and rape trials have anonymity.Journalists or editors who disclose any information that could prejudice a criminal trial, or make comments likely to influence jurors, could be guilty of contempt of court, and end up in jail.Already, one pro-SNP commentator, the former British diplomat Craig Murray, has been warned by the Crown Office that a satirical post he published in January could be ldquogravely in contempt.So, no satire or speculation from me. I make no comment about Mr Salmondrsquos guilt or innocence. Irsquoll just say that these are serious charges, potentially carrying long prison sentences.And that the Crown Office has released a lot of detail already.The indictment alleges that Mr Salmond attempted to rape a woman in his official residence in Bute House in June . He is said to have pinned her against a wall, to have removed her clothes and his own, before pushing her on to a bed and lying naked on top of her.In December , he is alleged to have caused a woman to lie on his bed, struggled with her and pulled up her dress.Other charges include an allegation he groped a woman in the Ego nightclub in Edinburgh in or around , and to have removed a womanrsquos shoe in  and tried to kiss her foot.Mr Salmond insists that he is innocent of all criminal charges.Like any defendant, the former First Minister has the presumption of innocence on his side. His guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.This trial ndash of one of the leading Scottish politicians of the age ndash will have huge political reverberations. It comes at a crucial moment for the SNP and the nationalist movement.Salmondrsquos prosecution intersects with growing isions over the future direction of the independence campaign. It could also affect Nicolarsquos Surgeonrsquos future as leader.There is a parliamentary inquiry into what the First Minister knew about the allegations about her mentor, and when she knew them. She has admitted that she held a number of private meetings with Salmond about the allegations without informing her civil servants.More seriously, this trial breaks just as increasing numbers of SNP activists are despairing of the prospects for a second independence referendum. Sturgeon keeps promising to deliver indyref, but it never arrives.Many frustrated nationalists believe thatAlex Salmond had still been leading the party, there would have been a referendum of some sort by now. They believe Sturgeon is too small lsquocrsquo conservative. Too insistent on a strictly legal route to independence.Salmond ndash and I state this not as a character reference ndash was one of the most successful populist politicians Britain has ever produced. An insurgent with a unique gt for communicating with Scottish voters of all backgrounds, he always led from the front.In , after he became leader of the SNP, he pulled the party to the left and made ldquoIndependence in Europe the partyrsquos mission statement. Then, in the mid-s, he defeated the fundamentalists in the party and persuaded the SNP to support devolution.Labour Politicians like the Cabinet minister, George Robertson, said that the Scottish Parliament, inaugurated in , would ldquokill nationalism stone dead. It did precisely the reverse.In , Alex Salmond declared himself First Minister of the first SNP Government in history. Then,in , he led the SNP to a landslide election victory and demanded a referendum on independence.At the time, independence was much less popular than the SNP. This was why the then-prime minister, David Cameron, agreed to a referendum in the first place thinking he couldnrsquot lose. In the event, the Yes campaign came within % of winning the  referendum, plunging the UK state into panic.With that track record, it is hardly surprising that many nationalists see Salmond as a politicianwho can literally do no wrong and refuse to believe the charges against him.Two years ago, before the sexual misconduct allegations first arose, Salmond had been making clear he intended toto active politics, following his retirement in . He even suggested he would be one of the leaders of the next independence referendum campaign. Not everyone in the party thought this would be a good thing.At no time did he challenge Nicola Sturgeonrsquos leadership ndash she was, after all, his protege and worked intimately with him for over a decade in the Scottish Government. But Salmond was known to be looking for a safe route back into Parliament.Then in August of that year a story was leaked to the Daily Record that two civil servants had made complaints of sexual misconduct by Alex Salmond in . Salmond rejected the allegations and in turn accused the head of the Scottish Civil Service, Lesley Evans, of misconduct.He took the Scottish Government to the Court of Session and won in January . The Scottish Government admitted fault and ended up paying Alex Salmond pound, of taxpayersrsquo money. It was massive humiliation.Most people, Salmond included, thought that would be an end of the matter. But only weeks later he was arrested by police on multiple charges of attempted rape and sexual assault.His followers simply refuse to believe that this icon of independence is anything but innocent. SNP members have poured tens of thousands into his defence fund.This has allowed him to put together a high-powered defence team, led by Gordon Jackson QC, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. He is supported by Shelagh McCall QC, the chair of the human rights organisation Justice Scotland.Some years ago, Jackson successfully defended a Collie dog, who was about to be put down after allegedly biting a policeman. He won after Brigitte Bardot flew in to support the defence.Such glamorous witnesses are not expected in the Salmond case. But all eyes will be on the High Court of Justiciary tomorrow to seeJackson can deliver an even greater legal victory."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-claws-contract","story":"THE Diary likes to think of itself as a Louvre Museum on paper.

Watching Love is Blind is like observing a live vivisection of modern love, of modern romance ndash of the way we search for love, of the value we put on love, of what we want from love, of what it means these days to fall in love.The Netflix series puts love on the operating table and opens it up to find out what makes it tick in the st century.The premise of the show is this: can you fall in love with someone without ever meeting them face to face. And herersquos the kicker ndashyou do fall in love, will you get married within the month The mechanics of the show see  men and  women, whorsquove never met, live separately from each other. They never see each other or come into physical contact with one another.However, the participants are able to talk to each other constantly in private rooms partitioned by opaque glass that cannot be seen through. So they can hear each other, listen to each other, talk and laugh, flirt and fall out ndash but they can never see what the other person looks like.Couples quickly start to pair up. Some hit it off right away, others instantly donrsquot attract each other. It doesnrsquot take long before real emotional attachments develop. And of course, the producers fuel the flirting with plenty of free and disinhibiting alcohol.After  days, the show moves into a new stage. If any of the couples think theyrsquove fallen in love and could spend the rest of their lives together, then now is the time to say so.Almost half the couples paired off ndash out of  people who took part in this strange experiment,  got together.But they didnrsquot just get together ndash they got engaged. To be married. And that marriage is coming in less than a month. At this point, the couples still havenrsquot seen each other in the flesh.Finally, six couples get to meet in person. Therersquos tears and hugging and kissing and promises of everlasting love. But for some itrsquos clear therersquos no physical attraction at all.All six couples head off to Mexico for a holiday ndash and to seeprotestations of love can become physical love. The bottom line is: will they have sex The answer is that most do, but some donrsquot. And itrsquos painful to see how this lack of intimacy eats away at strong friendships which had been built on personality not looks.Once the holiday is over, itrsquos time to try living together. This is were the cracks really begin to show ndash where the glamour and thrill of falling in love are replaced by the daily demands of sharing your every waking hour with someone whorsquos still essentially a stranger.Then itrsquos time to meet the parents, to work out where to live. Who will make compromises over their career  Who wants a child  Who doesnrsquot As the weeks tick away, therersquos only one challenge left ndash to make it to the altar.I finished the series last night. Do they all marry  Well, I donrsquot want to give any spoilers away but I suppose in some cases love can be blind ndash in other cases love has very clear - vision.The contestants are all millennials. No-one is over . Netflix, of course, is able to navigate the millennial hive mind like no other part of our media or culture ndash its producers, directors and writers seem to intuitively know how millennials tick, what appeals to them, and what they need.And so what makes Love is Blind so fascinating is how the series focuses on romantic isolation. It seems to be saying that at its heart the millennial generation is lonely. And that is genuinely saddening.The participants in the show were all desperate for love. Love has been hard to find for them.The show felt like a subconscious rejection of the dating app, of the inhumanity of swiping left and right for love and romance and sex. The contestants have spent their lives behind screens.Dating apps are about one thing: the purely physical ndash is a potential partner good enough looking. The true personality of others goes undiscovered. Love is Blind reverses that, and itrsquos neatly subversive.Once upon a time all of us either met our partners at school, in our neighbourhoods, at college or university, at work, or in pubs and clubs. Today, community is fading away like leaves in winter.Love is Blind seemed to pity a generation dealing with the challenges of falling in love at a time when many are unsure what the rules are anymore, or even where to find love or how to find love, of a world where office romances might be frowned upon by HR or college flirting misconstrued.Itrsquos a rare emotion to feel these days, but Love is Blind reaffirms common humanity. The participants dealt with all the problems that have come with falling in love down the ages ndash money, family, bigotry.And all the joys: finding a partner in crime, devotion to another person, unconditional support.And when it came to the battle of the sexes both were as bad, and as good, as each other. Men failed, men were kind women failed, women were kind.This reality series shows that whatrsquos changed in this constantly changing age isnrsquot love itself. Love has mercully remained the same, itrsquos the one essential part of what we are which makes us human. Whatrsquos changed is the way we look for love, find love, and fall in love.This is love in the time of the coronavirus. Wersquore inherently social creatures but the digital world is shutting us away from one another. Self-isolating. Thatrsquos not just a threat to love, but to what it means to be human.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"reckless-brexit-plans-the-elephant-room-says-snp","story":"Kirsty Blackman MP has warned that the Conservativesrsquo Brexit plans will leave families poorer and worse off, and push people towards hardship.She said the Tories were ldquowriting a blank cheque for their own self-interest by ignoring the views of those who did not vote for Brexit.:UK Governmentrsquos Brexit position dangerous, says Mike RussellSpeaking to The Herald, Blackman said: ldquoAs the UK government prepares to set out its Budget it cannot ignore the elephant in the room.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The slow progress on establishing basic connectivity for businesses and iniduals in the Northern Isles has been deeply frustrating.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April .

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Others may come in months later. All have to be approved by Parliament in a Finance Bill, tabled following four days of debate on the Budget.ndash Who sees the Budget first Apart from the ministers and officials involved in drafting it, the monarch is traditionally the first to see the Budget, granting the Chancellor an audience the day before its release. The Budget is presented to senior ministers at a special meeting of Cabinet in  Downing Street hours before being unveiled to the House of Commons.ndash Why is it called a Budget The name comes from the old French word ldquobougette, meaning little bag.

Geoffrey Howe in the s preferred gin and tonic and Kenneth Clarke whisky, but more recent chancellors Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond have all drunk water.When Norman Lamont held up his red box for photographers before one of his Budgets in the early s, unbeknown to them it contained only a bottle of Highland Park whisky, with the crucial statement instead carried by aide William Hague ndash who went on to become Tory leader..\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production debbdcacafacffYudGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTQwNTkwMzcz ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"William Gladstone delivered the longest continuous Budget speech ndash What are the longest and shortest speeches Disraelirsquos  statement took five hours, but he had a break.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram.

Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

The demand this week has been exhausting.The hand sanitiser is all gone and now it#s all hand gel and handwash.We#ve had a couple of companies install mounted wall dispensers because people are stealing bottles from work.Mrs Monteith said some companies were also asking to hire her cleaning staff on a full-time basis.Some we can accommodate and some we can#t. Some existing customers want to quadruple their cleaning requirements overnight as well, she added.The focus of the cleaning will be on frequent contact points such as door handles, chairs and keyboards.Donna also advises customers in offices not to overlook items such as keycards and mobile phones.Over the last week, for both our cleaning and hygiene services, we#re getting hundreds of enquiries, she said.A lot of it is from existing customers.

The NASUWT#s website has added a page updating members who are infected and advice on school trips.It says: As cases occur, more people will be required to self-isolate. It is vital that staff follow the advice of the Government to prevent the spread.Where teachers are absent from work due to self-isolation, this should be considered a medical suspension rather than sick leave and full pay should apply. Absence should also be disregarded for absence management procedures.Schools should ensure that risk assessments for visits abroad are reviewed, taking into account not only the risk of infection, but also the risk of becoming stranded, should the situation deteriorate rapidly. Schools should liaise closely with tour operators in their decision-making process of whether to cancel any visits.SDLP education spokesman and West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan also asked for an action plan for schools.However, the Ulster Unionists# spokesman for health said there was no need for alarm.Robbie Butler MLA added: If the scientic advice changes, then we must react accordingly, but we must listen to what the medical and scientic experts are saying and take their advice.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: Economist warns of £k blow to Belfast over St Patrick#s shutdownCancelling Belfast#s St Patrick#s Day parade could cost the city#s economy around £, and affect staff numbers, an economist has said. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDerry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowTributes to young Antrim farmer Ward Patterson after sudden deathCoronavirus: Belfast Halax call centre closed after staff member tests positive Cash in transit employee threatened with handgun during Belfast city centre armed robberyMother of Padraig Fox dies from #broken heart# following killer#s #short sentence#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s about having that option.“I think it’s a good thing and hopefully,we can get classes up and running, it’s something that could really take off.”Local MLA Kathleen McGurk has been supportive of the plan and is confident it will improve the area.She said: “Quite a few areas of Foreglen didn’t even have signage.“This will harmonise the whole area, get some nice new signs in and the residents were keen to get them in Irish as well.“It’s a small, close-knit community with a lot of Irish roots and the people would be keen.

Councillor for the area, Brenda Chivers, said that although the provision of a waste water plant was still an issue for the school development, she didn’t see it as ‘problematic’. She said: “I sincerely hope that work on the new school will commence as soon as possible. “I would praise all the good work of pupils, staff, parents and the Board of Governors for all their diligent work to date.”Local GAA side Limavady Wolfhounds have also been given the go-ahead to develop their existing provision on the Scroggy Road.The work will include a new grass pitch, G training area, ball catchers and a walking path around the complex. Committee member Declan Quigley and his company AQB Architectural Workshop were a driving force in the development.He said: “This involves the redevelopment of an empty field known to the club as the ‘hill field’. It lies to the rear of our existing main pitch.“We were facing the possibility of losing our existing training grounds at some point when the lease runs out and the parish kindly agreed to sell us the area required to build a second pitch.“Once that was put in place, a planning application was lodged for a second full-size grass pitch with floodlighting, fences, dugouts and ball catches.“We had enough ground to provide an underage G training pitch. It’s a half-size pitch which is also floodlit.“Looking towards giving back to the community and giving parents something to do while their kids are down at training, we developed the idea of a km walking loop.“It meanders around the existing pitch and will go around the proposed new phase development. It will have lighting on it so anyone can come and do walk when it suits them.“That was approved through council last week and the club would like to thank Causeway Coast and Glens council for the approval. “It leaves us in a position where we can develop that bit of ground and protect the club’s future, while maintaining a valuable youth link, which is very important in an urban setting.“We have five years to develop it from a planning point of view, but would like to get that process started immediately, or as soon as financially possible.”Cllr Chivers said the development would further improve the developments the club has made to date.She said: “This will signicantly enhance the excellent facilities that this far-seeing and dynamic club have provided to date.“I congratulate all the management, members, players and supporters on all their efforts.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We will be working closely with all parties to ensure this becomes a reality.“While the UK left the EU at the end of January, the UK Government’s announcement last week that it is prepared to walk away from trade talks by June is hugely concerning for businesses across the North West, especially those who trade and travel across the border.“Over the next nine months, Chamber will be working hard to ensure businesses in the North West have access to unfettered trade across Great Britain, the EU, and beyond.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

Edwardstone has won two of his three starts over hurdles and would have beaten Stolen Silver last time out had he not hung left on the run-in on appalling ground. Hes seen to best effect on soft or good to soft and will benefit from a strong pace. The Supreme is often run at a frantic pace and that will play to his strengths. Hell be held up in fourth or fth and could be staying on strongest up the hill. With bookmakers paying four and five places on the eachway market, this horse is tremendous value. googletag.cmd.push : - FAKIR DOUDARIES  - Course form is important at Cheltenham and thats why Fakir DOudaries, fourth in last years Supreme Novice Hurdle, is getting the nod here. This race has been won by an Irish-trained horse in four of the last five years and we again dominate the market with Fakir DOudaries and Notebook of Henry De Bromheads yard. Fakir DOudaries lost to that rival last time out but connections have admitted tactics were wrong that day. He also found himself short of room up the inside and was forced out. Nonetheless, he was only beaten a little over aby Notebook. He saw out the hill well last year after a fast-run Supreme and is a Grade  winner over fences thanks to an incredible - win in the Drinmore at Fairyhouse in December. This horse jumps well and will be ridden patiently for a strong finish. Expect him to be right in the frame as they hit the last. googletag.cmd.push : - DISCORAMA  - Continuing the trend of course form being king at Cheltenham, this horse could be one of the best-handicapped of the week. Paul Nolan is a somewhat forgotten man in Irish racing but he has his string in good form and could land a couple of winners this week. This lad could be one of them, despite losing his last two races by a cumulative  s. He has had a wind operation since then and also has some serious form in the book. Looking at Cheltenham, he was second in the Martin Pipe in  and looked all over the winner of the four-miler last year before given way to Le Breuil at the line. He has shaped as a proper staying chaser without really taking flight. He hasnt won a chase race since his first over fences at Naas back in November , but dont hold that against him either. He was second to Delta Work, relegating Ryanair Chase favourite A Plus Tard to third in a Grade  at Punchestown last April and was just the s down on many peoples idea of a winner this week, Champagne Classic, before his withdrawal. That run behind Delta Work is the best in the book andhe comes back to that form and laps up Cheltenham again, he could be powering up the hill in front come pm on Tuesday. : - DARVER STAR  - This would be somewhat of a fairytale for his Louth owners, but in a very open and relatively weak Champion Hurdle, this horse could outlast them all up the hill. While unlike a future champion winner, he picked up his first win in a handicap hurdle at Wexford in April last year after five unsuccessful trips to the track before that. He was rated  in that Wexford race but has had a meteoric rise since then. Hes won four times in the intervening period, including a listed race in Limerick last October, but it is his performances in defeat in graded company that catch the eye most of all. After his fourth win on the spin, he went up against Ballymore favourite Envoi Allen at Fairyhouse in December. He was a   outsider but admirably finished just four s behind Envoi Allen. That was good enough form but may have been written off as a flukeDarver Star didnt follow it up with something similar. He did just that and probably surpassed that display by running Honeysuckle very close at Leopardstown last month. He was slow enough to get into stride but after the last, he was gaining ground on Henry De Bromheads star and market principle in the Mares Hurdle all the way to the line. He was denied by half abut beat the likes of Petit Mouchoir and Supasundae in the process. : - STORMY IRELAND  - I accept that this race is a match between Benie Des Dieux and Honeysuckle but the former is   and while I think shell win, Im going to the place market. As evidenced last year when Benie Des Dieux fell at the last while streaking clear, anything can happen in racing. If one or both of the top two in the market misfire, Stormy Ireland is best placed to pick up the pieces. She was second in this race last year and is evidently a better horse this term. She was runner-up on two occasions leading into last years festival but has won three on the spin this winter. She won all three at her ease by a combined  s. Shell be staying better than most up the hill and could even spring a surprise on one of the big players. Ill be surprisedshes out of the first three home. : - LORD SCHNITZEL  - A race for an eachway bet so how about a   shot. Lord Schnitzel could land a shock here based off two decent runs in a form book littered with poor displays. He finished just three s behind Carefully Selected last November and finished ahead of the likes of Glenloe in a race won by Faugheen a couple of weeks earlier. This is his best trip ands while he deserves to be  , hes capable of putting in a performance on his day. At a shorter price, Espoir De Guyeis a rapid improver with a nice profile. : - LORD DU MESNIL  - This notorious slog has been shortened somewhat this year but you still need a horse that stays all day to tackle the Cheltenham hill after running three and a half miles. Having finished second in a Grand National trial at Haydock last time out, Lord Du Mesnil fits that bill superbly. He is a distance specialist and has a top jockey on board in Sam Whaley-Cohen. Before that National trial, Lord Du Mesnil beat decent yardstick Perfect Candidate by nine s. He has won three times this season, improving on each occasion. Carefully Selected is the big gamble of this race for Willie Mullins but is prone to a mistake, a trait which could cost him over this gruelling trip at Cheltenham.

Two early Cahir Higgins frees saw the Derry champions open up an early lead, but they were dealt a blow on  minutes when Conor Love reacted quickest to a breaking ball and fired low past Cahir Hasson to give Enniskillen the lead. Dungiven then suffered a double whammy. First they lost midfielder Daire McKeever to a red card for his part unsavoury post-goal exchanges, and then Cahir Higgins saw his penalty superbly turned around the post by Gaels goalkeeper Cian Newman. googletag.cmd.push Points from Richie Mullan and Fintan Murphy edged Dungiven in front before the break and Feargal Higgins opened it to two points at the beginning of the second half, but Enniskillen replied strongly. Fermanagh senior list Johnny Cassidy swung over a beauty in response and a th minute Eoin Beacom point levelled matters before Enniskillen took the lead. John Rehill burrowed his way along the touchline and squared for Paddy Cassidy to fist home in front of Cahir Hasson and open a three-point gap. Dungiven though were nonplussed and a brace of Richie Mullan frees either side of Cahir Higgins th minute free saw the deficit eradicated and with extra time looming, St Canices found a winner. googletag.cmd.push Feargal Higgins collected the ball in the full-forward line, held off his marker and squeezed over a right-footed effort on  minutes almost from the end line.

He was just over three s behind that rival at Naas but a similar distance ahead of him at Leopardstown. He can continue that upward curve here. Hell act on the ground and should stay out the trip on the testing ground. googletag.cmd.push : - ALLAHO  gets the vote here after improving massively from his first to second chase start this winter. On his debut over fences, he was just over abehind stablemate Easy Game but improved and looked a real prospect in beating Milan Native by  s at Fairyhouse in January. The fact that Paul Townend will be on his back on Wednesday suggests hes outperforming Easy Game at home and will carry Willie Mullins main hope in this race. He also has Cheltenham form, albeit over hurdles, having been third behind the re-opposing Minella Indo in last years Albert Bartlett. He looks a natural chaser and will handle the testing ground very well. It may be an omen that he was sired by a horse called No Risk At All. Heres hoping! googletag.cmd.push : - There are a couple of improvers here well ahead of the handicapper but my slight preference is for ALFA MIX  over Stratum. JP McManus loves Cheltenham winners and it could be signicant that he purchased Alfa Mix between his last run and today. On that last run at Navan, he travelled like a dream and ranged up before a mistake two out halted his chances of beating the top weight here today, Kilfenora. Gavin Cromwell trains this one and has his horses in brilliant form. He was third in the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday with Darver Star and could get into the winners enclosure with this one. He beat a number of these rivals on his previous run, also at Navan, where the likes of Cracking Smart and Top Moon were behind him. That was admittedly off a low weight but hes been given a chance by the handicapper and has been put away since January for this race. Hell travel better than most and with some luck in running, hell be coming up the hill in front. : - With Altior withdrawn on Tuesday, this is now a match between Defi Du Seuil and my selection CHACUN POUR SOI . This horse is one of the best Willie Mullins has for the next couple of seasons and has already beaten Defi Du Seuil at Punchestown last year. That was at the end of a season for Defi Du Seuil but the manner in which Chacun Pour Soi outlasted him to the line was impressive. Also on official ratings, Chacun Pour Soi achieved the best performance of this year of any of these horses by some distance. That came when he beat Min by over three s at Leopardstown at the Dublin Racing Festival last month. The ground is a slight unknown but that victory over Min was on yielding to soft and his seasonal re-appearance, when he was three s behind A Plus Tard, was on soft to heavy. I think hell handle it and will have the finish to pip Defi Du Seuil up the hill. : - I hope Im wrong but I think Tiger Roll will be beaten here by a horse called EASYSLAND . He is a cross country specialist and while Tiger Roll was a - winner in this last year, there was nothing as good as this French import in the line-up. Easysland is unbeaten over the ditches in six starts, mostly in France, but prepped for this by travelling to Cheltenham and winning the cross country last December. He made two mistakes late that day but still stayed on to win by seven, beating some of these on the day. Hell be ridden prominently so as to stay out of trouble and could upset the favourite backers. Tiger Roll has bigger fish to fry in the Grand National next month. He hasnt had as smooth a preparation this year for this pitstop and could go down to a second defeat of the season. : - I wouldnt have a strong opinion on this but TRONADOR  is interesting for Gordon Elliott. He has twice won this race with big price winners, including Veneer of Charm who won at   in . Tronador has been tucked away for this race and will go off a nice handy weight with a top jockey in Denis ORegan on board. This horse has also got a few mentions in Cheltenham previews, including from Gordon Elliott himself. This could be a gamble on track on the day, although the preference of his stablemate Aramax in the field might keep him at a nice eachway price. : - Appreciate Itis the talking horse for Willie Mullins in this but its a race that has thrown up a couple of shocking results in recent years. I was taken with DARLING DAUGHTER  when she won unexpectedly at odds of   at Leopardstown last month. She tracked the leaders in a nice spot that day and found plenty when asked to go for home two furlongs out by Lisa ONeill. She beat Politesse that day with that rival franking the form by beating Watergate Lady by five s at Thurles a couple of weeks later. The latter has decent form tied in with Appreciate It and Asterion Forlonge who was fourth in the Supreme on Tuesday. That gives Darling Daughter a chance and her mares allowance will go a long way on testing ground. She could run a big race at a big price.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead. It is too early to comment on inidual schemes in the absence of more certainty around budget availability to the Department in   and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 PD.jpg","title":"PD prepares for CrossFit Games  ","story":"A LEITRIM man is preparing to take on the worldrsquos best this summer in the CrossFit Games in the United States.PD Savage will represent Ireland in the five-day competition in Madison, Wisconsin, in July.

I did my first competition and then I got hooked. Itrsquos only now I realise how exercise and fitness helped deal with what was going on with my motherrsquos illness.PD is the current All Ireland CrossFit champion and recently ramped up his training.He said: ldquoIrsquom working out twice a day, six days a week.

It really has taken over my le at the moment and I guess it has really spiralled from initially being a hobby and slowly becoming more and more competitive.PD is halfway to raising the pound, he needs for being in the US for seven weeks leading up to the competition.He hopes to raise a further pound, for Alzheimerrsquos Research through some sponsored events in his gym and by the sale of event tee-shirts.To support PD, you can find him on social media s, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Roads.jpg","title":"Roads top agenda in public meeting  ","story":"A SERIES of roads issues topped the agenda at a public meeting in Newcastle last week.Organised by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local SDLP councillors, a number of people took part in the event at the Newcastle Centre.The public session is the first of many the SDLP plans to organise across the constituency to provide people with an opportunity to voice their concern on a iety of issues.Mr McGrath described last weekrsquos meeting and future events across the district as ldquonew activism with the focus on listening to and engaging with the community.He continued: ldquoWe had no ing Stormont Executive or Assembly for so long and we have had no accountability.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Mr Sunak became the new chancellor on February , with less than a month to prepare for his first Budget.The Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP @RishiSunak has been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer @HMTreasury pic OTYOkujnbomdash UK Prime MinisterFebruary , Mr Javid became the first chancellor not to deliver a Budget since Iain Macleod, who died shortly after taking office in .ndash So what is the Budget It is an annual statement by the Chancellor to the House of Commons setting out the state of the nationrsquos finances and the Governmentrsquos proposals for changes to taxation.ndash Will anything  be announced The independent Office for Budget Responsibility will release its economic forecasts on subjects such as growth, inflation and employment for the next few years.ndash Will any tax changes happen straight away Some measures ndash usually including changes to taxes on alcohol and tobacco ndash come into effect on Budget day or soon after. Others may come in months later. All have to be approved by Parliament in a Finance Bill, tabled following four days of debate on the Budget.ndash Who sees the Budget first Apart from the ministers and officials involved in drafting it, the monarch is traditionally the first to see the Budget, granting the Chancellor an audience the day before its release. The Budget is presented to senior ministers at a special meeting of Cabinet in  Downing Street hours before being unveiled to the House of Commons.ndash Why is it called a Budget The name comes from the old French word ldquobougette, meaning little bag. Statements on financial policy used to be brought to the Commons in a leather bag, but now the Chancellor uses a red despatch box. vw,vw,px, px\"Gordon Brown had a new Red Box created for his first Budget ndash What is the famous Red Box A wooden box lined with black satin and covered with scarlet leather was made for William Gladstone in around  and was used by successive chancellors for more than  years. James Callaghan broke with tradition by using a new box in  and Gordon Brown did the same in .

Ryan was supposed to have been taken to the Learning Support Centre. But his father later discovered he didn’t arrive until noon that day. “We were left in shock,” Mr Calvert said.A spokesperson for the Education Authority commented: “We can confirm we are investigating the circumstances surrounding an incident on a contracted private hire route involving a pupil attending Edenderry Primary School on Wednesday  February . On becoming aware of this incident, we took immediate action as the safety and well-being of pupils is our primary concern.“We take incidents of this nature extremely seriously and have offered our unreserved apology to the pupil and their parents. As this matter is under investigation no further comment can be made as it may be prejudicial to the process.” Edenderry PS principal Stephen Doyle said they were ‘very concerned about this child being left on the bus’.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
