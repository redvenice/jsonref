Dogs were kept \u0027inside of a rotting caravan, with a filthy duvet for bedding\u0027 said Ms Wiltshire          Ms Wiltshire claimed bedding was thrown over droppings instead of it being cleaned          Cats were allegedly left to roam free or lived in sweltering caravans and even began \u0027panting\u0027          Because bigger dogs \u0027posed a danger to other animals they were each kept in decaying caravans with small outside runs\u0027          Cats and their litters were kept in cramped caravans with wooden partitions She added: \u0027They (sanctuary owners David and Julia Vaughan) will see my story as a betrayal. Perhaps it is - I feel like it is. But if I kept silence, it would be an even bigger betrayal of the many animals unable to speak up for themselves.\u0027Joanna added that Mr and Mrs Vaughan do care about the animals but said there is no way the couple are able to look after their 200 plus animals that includes ponies, sheep, goats, alpacas, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs.Local resident Whitney Dawson visited the site last month and said: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\u0027          Cats were described as feral and left free to breed at their leisure on the rubbish-strewn site          Joanna said cats that were too young to be mothers gave birth to several litters, like Eeyore (pictured)           Conditions in one of the dogs caravans show a heavily littered ground and stagnant water           Eeyore (pictured) stands out as having had three litters in the space of a year          The former volunteer said rabbits were kept in tiny huts that were rarely cleanedThe 22-year-old added: \u0027It was horrendous. There was rubbish everywhere including broken bricks and mouldy food.\u0027The whole place stank and I had to dump my clothes after leaving one of the caravans because I was covered in fleas.\u0027Some of the dog bowls were full of black stagnant water and there were a lot of abandoned cages and fish tanks. It was just awful.\u0027          The sanctuary, run by David and Julia Vaughan, is moving to a new location after complaints from locals and activists          The yard was strewn in rubbish after the owners upped and left to start fresh at a new site          Residents described seeing dog bowls full of black stagnant water, flea-infested caravans and abandoned fish tanks at the site          It was home to 200 animals, including pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, cats, dogs and turkeys          Outdoor mess at the sanctuary which is moving location after fierce complaints from residentsMr Vaughan responded to those claims and denied any wrongdoing. He reported the site to police - because it was a target of break-ins by animal activists stealing cats.He said: \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. They have stolen four of our cats, ransacked the place and cut open a fence.\u0027We needed to leave the cats on the site until we had a suitable home for them at the new site. They have been fed and watered twice-a-day, every day.    \u0027We are doing our best overall. We are on our own and at this 12-14 hours a day.\u0027We\u0027re just here to give a home to animals nobody wants and we wish everyone would leave us alone to get on with our job.\u0027          Shocking pictures reveal squalid conditions at the sanctuary facing fierce criticism from localsJoanna said she had to pay for animal care out of her own pocket on several occasions. She added that she also took a kitten home to care for because its mother couldn\u0027t provide sufficient milk because of inadequate food.  The kitten died less than 24 hours later. Joanna also took videos and pictures of emaciated kittens and others panting with droopy eyes. Joanna described the heat in the caravans as \u0027stifling\u0027 and said she even had to buy a cool pad to offer the kittens some relief. She said: \u0027The cats also suffered with flies as the pens built for them were mostly inside the rotting caravans and were stifling. Cats and kittens were shut in the caravans and panting in the heat.          A petition started by Nicole Knight, says: \u0027Shut down Didcot Animal Sanctuary for good!\u0027          The owners of the site deny any wrongdoing and even claim some of their cats were stolen\u0027Ventilation was poor and there were so many flies that one day I discovered a food bowl literally alive with maggots. It wasn’t just one or two. It was a writhing mass that filled the entire bowl. \u0027The fly situation was not helped by the fact that the cats were not accustomed to litter trays and frequently went in corners of the pen. Sometimes the mess would be cleared up, but often it was dealt with by just throwing a blanket down to hide it.\u0027Joanna added that the RSPCA had made a visit to the site but is \u0027failing the animals\u0027.She said: \u0027In response to public opinion, the sanctuary are re-inventing themselves as a small-holding and are now refusing entry to all members of the public.           A rubbish strewn yard at Didcot Animal Sanctuary in Oxfordshire which has come under fire          David and Julia Vaughan and their mess were blasted in a 1,700 word Facebook post 18 months ago\u0027If action is not taken, this can only mean that things will become even worse as they will have no volunteers to assist them with the daily care of the animals. \u0027The RSPCA have failed these animals. They have inspected at least once and passed them despite seeing the deficiencies in care.\u0027     Mail Online contacted the RSPCA, who said: \u0027We are so grateful to people who report suspected animal suffering to us and we would like to reassure people we will always look into and, if necessary, investigate any complaints made to us about animal welfare.\u0027Unfortunately we are unable to discuss complaints about specific people and what action may have been taken. We understand how frustrating that is for animals lovers but releasing information could prejudice a future investigation or could lead to us being fined.\u0027    "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye dons MAGA hat Free Hoover sweatshirt final performance SNL","story":"    Kanye West wore a MAGA hat and a Free Hoover shirt for his final performance on SNLKanye West caused a stir on the SNL stage with his fashion choices on Saturday night.The rapper, who hours earlier renamed himself \u0027Ye\u0027, promoted President Donald Trump and \u0027Hoover\u0027 - believed to be jailed gang leader Larry - with his outfits, as he performed three times during the show.In the finale, West was seen in a Make America Great Again Hat as well as a Free Hoover sweatshirt.Earlier this week, the rapper claimed to have redesigned the MAGA hat, by changing the brim and the shape of the front.

We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment.

He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.     Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 It\u0027s not the first time West has shared controversial opinions about slavery. The rapper sparked outrage in May when he called slavery a \u0027choice\u0027 during an interview with TMZ. \u0027When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were there for 400 years and it\u0027s all of y\u0027all. It\u0027s like we\u0027re mentally imprisoned.\u0027It wasn\u0027t until months later that West finally apologized for the outburst during a radio appearance in late August.West told WGCI he never \u0027approached or addressed the slavery comment fully\u0027 because \u0027it\u0027s not something for me to overly intellectualize\u0027.He then apologized for how his tone and how his actions, including wearing the MAGA hat on several occasions, have affected his fans.            West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016\u0027I\u0027m sorry for the one-two of the MAGA hat into the slavery comment. And I\u0027m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment,\u0027 he said.Fans praised what appeared to be a heartfelt apology, but were in for another let down when West unveiled his redesigned version of the red cap bearing Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign earlier this week. He told Fader that he had added \u0027positive energy\u0027 to the hat by flattening the brim and changing its shape slightly.   Kanye has stunned fans by becoming one of the few celebrities - as well as one of the only prominent African Americans - to support Trump.He went to visit Trump in 2016 shortly after the rapper disappeared to seek mental health treatment.His wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian, has gone twice to see Trump at the White House.Kanye recently promised that a new album, called \u0027Yahndi,\u0027 would come out on Saturday but no work immediately appeared.    Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADERKanye West Says His Slavery Comment Abolishing 13th Amendment is Work in Progress | TMZ.com"},{"url":null,"title":"British couple hailed heroes returning 6 200","story":"    Edward Gibson and Jessica Frank have been praised for handing in thousands of pounds in euros which they found while on holiday in GreeceThey told The Sun: \u0027When police took us to meet the lady she was crying and blessing us.

And they are reasonably confident that they and their family can weather an economic shock—like illness or a spell of unemployment—without falling back into extreme poverty.\u0027The middle class are on track to reach 4 billion people worldwide by the end of 2020 – and 5.3 billion by 2030.The majority of people newly entering the middle class live in Asia, with nearly nine in 10 of the next billion middle-class consumers living in that part of the world, spread between China, India, South and South East Asia.The middle class in Asia has largely grown due to the increase in productivity and improved manufacturing technologies at major multinational companies in those countries, Kharas said.          The middle class are on track to reach 5.3 billion people by 2030, according to an analysis by the Brookings InstituteMany businesses in Asian countries have also narrowed their focus on what they produce and sell in order to bring their strongest products to market and become an effective part of what experts call the \u0027global value chain.\u0027For example, in the Philippines, instead of producing a whole car (as in the past), companies there now produce just the electronic hardware and upholstery for vehicles – a change that has made them more profitable to the benefit of their workers and middle class overall. In addition, Asia hasn’t had a currency crisis since 1997 – in which foreign investors and domestic residents took their currency out of national markets, causing currency values to plunge and leading to inflation.\u0027Those kinds of things generate big setbacks for the middle class,\u0027 Kharas said. \u0027In Asia, for the past 20 years there hasn\u0027t been those kinds of setbacks, which has contributed to the growth of the middle class.\u0027 While global development efforts focus on elevating the world\u0027s poorest, just one person is lifted out of extreme poverty every second, while five people enter the middle class every second, according to Brookings.This is important because the middle class is the engine that drives demand in the global economy – and governments listen when the middle class makes demands.In addition, private households account for roughly half of the global economic demand and two-thirds of that comes from the middle class. By comparison, the rich spend more per person but make up such a small proportion of the population that they can\u0027t move the economic needle the way the teeming middle class can.Ultimately, a growing middle class means a stronger global economy and a larger population to be targeted by businesses around the world. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/13/4FE0840D00000578-0-image-a-53_1536410217615.jpg","title":"Pregnant girl 16 loses baby never walk getting breast tattooed","story":"    Luisa Fernanda Buitrago, 16, lost her baby and is now in a wheelchair after an the infection from a tattoo spread to her spinal cord           Luisa Fernanda Buitrago lost her baby and has been left in a wheelchair after she had a tattoo on her right breast and the infection spread to her spinal cord Father-of-two, 47, is paralysed and unable to breath without...Teenage footy player who had to learn how to eat again after...Share this articleShe underwent surgery to drain off some of the liquid caused by the infection but then developed problems with her appendix.She then needed further treatment to help her deal with depression caused by the loss of her baby.Miss Fernanda has now spoken out about her experiences on social media to warn other youngsters about the dangers of tattoos.She said: \u0027As I had to take a lot of medicine, I had a miscarriage and lost the son I was carrying.

The service is held by the Dean of Westminster with the reading performed by the Lord Chancellor.The ceremony has been held continuously since the Middle Ages, with the exception of the years 1940 to 1946 because of World War II. In 1953 it was held in St Margaret\u0027s Church because Westminster Abbey was still decorated for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.Before the ceremony, two new justices were sworn in at the supreme court. Alongside Lord Kitchen, Lady Arden took her oath of office and her induction signals the checkpoint that a quarter of supreme court judges are women.

Mr Javid also warned that migrants would have to integrate.‘If you want to come to our country and contribute, great,’ he said, speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail. ‘But in exchange, we expect you to live by our British values and respect our values.’Mrs May, who has made ending free movement a ‘red line’ in her negotiations with Brussels, last night said the proposals would deliver on the referendum vow to take back control of the UK’s borders.‘For the first time in decades, it will be this country that controls and chooses who we want to come here,’ she said.The EU has warned it would respond to the UK ending free movement by stripping Britons of the automatic right to work and live anywhere in the bloc.

Theresa May  said: ‘For the first time in decades, it will be this country that controls and chooses who we want to come here’The immigration system unveiled today will be put in place from January 2021, after the UK’s transition out of the EU is complete. European migrants will have to apply for work visas in the same way as those from the rest of the world.Tourists would remain free to travel to the UK, and business travellers on short trips are expected to face a light-touch regime. The three million EU citizens already living in the UK will have full rights to stay.Ministers will now work with business to establish the level of immigration needed by the economy. But visa applicants will be required to meet minimum salary thresholds before taking a job.There will be ‘temporary’ exemptions for areas of the economy dependent on low-skilled migrants but businesses will be told to train up British workers.Mr Javid said his reforms would result in unskilled immigration from Europe becoming ‘much lower than it is today’.  Sajid Javid and Theresa May, pictured  at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, pledged that far fewer low skilled workers would be let in from Europe after BrexitHe questioned the benefit of large-scale unskilled immigration, saying: ‘It must have some kind of negative impact on wages growth in the UK.’But the Home Secretary insisted Britain would remain ‘a positive, outward-looking nation open to the best talent from across the world’.He added: ‘The immigration system should be very focused on high-skilled people that we might need and dramatically curb low-skilled people coming to our country. And at the same time look across the world.‘If we are talking about a software engineer or a surgeon, to me it doesn’t matter about the nationality of that inidual, it’s not really important. We want the talent and skill that they are going to bring so it shouldn’t matter if that high-skilled person is coming from India, Australia or France. What matters is the skill that they are going to bring to the UK.’          The Home Secretary, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, said  that the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next electionHe said the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next election.Mr Javid, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, also waded into the debate over Brexit, hinting that he could switch to backing a Canada-style trade deal if the EU rejected Mrs May’s Chequers plan at this month’s Brussels summit.He batted away questions about his own leadership ambitions but, in a significant move, he defended Mr Johnson, who has come under fire for his outspoken attacks on Chequers.

The 33-year-old American is world’s most famous ‘free solo’ climberThe man who climbed 3,000ft up the sheer face of Yosemite’s...Share this articleDressed in a red T-shirt, tatty grey hiking trousers and wearing a pair of special climbing shoes, all he had with him was a small bag of chalk to prevent his fingers slipping. A single error would, needless to say, have resulted in tumbling to a certain death.The record-breaking 3 hour 56 minute ascent, much of which relied on tiny cracks and hand-holds the thickness of your average HB pencil, has been chronicled in often spine-chilling detail in a National Geographic documentary called Free Solo.Thanks in part to its breathtaking footage of his progress up the climbing world’s most famous and photogenic rock face, the film has gained huge acclaim in the U.S., where it was released last week.Several critics have described it not only as ‘the greatest climbing movie ever made’ but also (with a nudge and a wink) as ‘gripping’.Yet for all Honnold’s derring-do, a hefty portion of the drama being played out that day was unfolding several miles from the picturesque valley where he was dangling by gnarled fingertips.At its centre was his girlfriend Sanni McCandless, who’d driven tearfully away from Yosemite at daybreak, fearing not only that her presence might prove to be a fatal distraction, but also that she might never again see the man she loved.    Alex Honnold,Sanni McCandless \u0027Free Solo\u0027 documentary premiere, Toronto International Film FestivalOn the day itself, June 3, Honnold rolls out of bed at 5 am, eats a bowl of muesli and sets off. In the first hour, he zooms past eight other climbers on El Capitan, all of whom are sleeping on hammocks pinned to the rock-face.Eventually, he finds himself entirely alone. The principal challenge is a section of El Capitan roughly 1,800 feet off the valley floor and known as the Boulder Problem.It consists of a vertical wall that can only be scaled using a handful of tiny holes and ripples in the rock that are several metres apart.‘There are about ten moves on it, and the holds are small and far apart,’ Honnold has said. ‘Only one of them is something you can pull down on.‘When everything’s facing sideways, if your foot slips or if anything happens, you’re shooting off the rock face — no matter how hard you’re holding on.‘It’s what makes the Boulder Problem so tough.’The section culminates in a highly-dangerous ‘karate kick’ manoeuvre during which a climber must launch their entire body across the cliff-face from one hold to another. Should they fail to execute it properly, a fall will almost always ensue.‘The crux of the crux involves this crazy karate kick into this corner, which requires a high degree of flexibility and precision, because you’re kicking at mid-chest height way out to the side, and once your foot’s over there you have to bring your hand over,’ Honnold has explained. ‘It’s just an outrageous sequence.’So concerned was Honnold at his ability to execute the move that he spent one day practising Boulder Section (with ropes) no fewer than 12 times. In the event, he managed it seamlessly.That sets the stage for a traditional Hollywood ending to the documentary. His first act, upon scampering to the summit, is to borrow a mobile telephone, call Sanni and tell her: ‘I love you.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Innocent children Syria going home land never seen","story":"    Hundreds of Syrians leave the Lebanese-Syrian border town of Arsal in Lebanon to make the journey across the mountains and return home to war-ravaged SyriaBut as many spoke of their relief to be heading back to their bombed-out villages, other families were torn apart as some relatives had not got approval to go back.Sobbing, Nouha Bo Ali Haj, 14, said she was returning from a camp on the outskirts of Arsal with her father – but not her mother, who is waiting for approval.Asked why she was crying, she said: \u0027I am going to miss my mother.\u0027Iran fires missiles with \u0027Death to America, Israel and Al...London mother, 26, who took her one-year-old daughter to...Share this articleRimi Bo Ali, 50, said: \u0027I registered but my name has not come back.\u0027She said her family had been forced to leave their home in the town of Fleta, just across the border, in 2014 and added: \u0027We are living in a camp – it is better for us to live in a house.

Now Pierre Huyghe is entering consciousness itself – with the help of AI and 50,000 bluebottles‘I was looking for something that could write itself, that could self-generate, evolve or mutate,” says Pierre Huyghe. Impeccably grizzled and sparkly eyed, the French artist sits vaping discreetly in dappled sunshine beaming through the upper windows of the Serpentine Gallery in London. Downstairs, Huyghe’s new exhibition is being installed. After our interview I’ll try for a glance through the gallery door. The show is not available for sneak peeks. I’ll try again, unsuccessfully, a week later. It’s not that they won’t let me in, the polite, dust-covered curator explains, it’s that they can’t. Not yet.I’m not surprised: Huyghe is exacting. Autonomous, changing, self-regulatory systems such as colonies of bees, iding cancer cells, flu virus, ants’ nests and groups of creatures cohabiting in an aquarium are this artist’s preferred raw materials. They tend to make his work tricky to install.While he also makes film and sculpture, over the last decade Huyghe has become known for reimagining the artwork as ecosystem. He deposits groups of objects – some evidently alive, others not so – into an environment, then retires and allows nature to take its course.Last summer I made a pilgrimage to his acclaimed ecosystem After ALife Ahead. An eight-hour journey from London ended in a rain-soaked trudge through the German city of Münster, to city margins where the urban fabric dissolves into a lacework of petrol stations, fast-food joints and leisure centres. Tucked behind a drive-through Burger King, Huyghe had excavated the concrete floor of a derelict ice rink and replaced portions of the ceiling with robotic hatches that opened and shut to the work’s mysterious inner rhythms.Climbing down into the vast pit revealed an alien landscape, pocked and uneven: packed clay towers housed colonies of bees algae grew in pools. On a platform in the middle was an aquarium housing a genetically modified GloFish and a venomous Conus textile sea snail. HeLa cancer cells ided, unseen, in an incubator. At the start of the work there had been chimera peacocks, too: piebald birds with two sets of DNA.An earlier environment, Untilled, included a lanky white dog called Human with one leg painted bubblegum pink and a concrete cast of a reclining nude, with a large bees’ nest that grew over her head like a parasitic mask. Installed between compost heaps in a park in Kassel, Germany, the bees pollinated psychotropic, medicinal and aphrodisiacal plants – nightshade, jimson weed, rye, cannabis. Frogs croaked, ants hatched, Human acquired the ennui befitting an art-world celebrity, and the cycle of life rolled on.Human, alas, will not make an appearance in Huyghe’s new work at the Serpentine. The star turn here is not animal, but artificial intelligence (AI), the processing of which we witness via five LED screens as it attempts to analyse events within the human brain.In January, Huyghe learned of a laboratory in Kyoto in which scientists were working on deep image reconstruction to decode complex visual information from human brain activity: artificial intelligence that can go some way toward working out what it is you’re looking at or visualising. This machine telepathy uses data harvested during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures brain activity. After analysing this brain activity, the AI sorts through vast nets of example images already in its system looking for fragments of a match to help it determine what image the human subject was holding in their mind’s eye.Huyghe worked with a man to whom he gave a set of interlinked images to visualise, some based on physical images, others that he invited him to imagine. The man pictured them one by one as his brain activity was monitored. What we see on the screens in the gallery is the AI moving through its exemplar images, sifting for echoes: we are looking not at the final result of the image reconstruction but a visible manifestation of the process of machine learning. Huyghe won’t disclose what the original images were: it’s up to us to decipher in turn what they might have been, and how they may be linked to one another.“Of course as a visual artist it is very appealing – a new medium,” says Huyghe. With machine learning he has generated an “ecosystem” of a different kind, passing “from a world that is constructed – with all the complexity and contingencies that go with it to evolve without me – to a world that can be imagined”.Rather than manipulating a physical environment, he is now, as he puts it, “gardening” in someone’s mind. The work asserts its autonomy first in the perceptual gap between Huyghe and his human subject – if I tell you to think of an apple, the apple you think of will not be the apple I think of – and then in the analysis and image construction undertaken by the AI.While “very impressive”, Huyghe warns that deep image reconstruction “is far from something close to a reality or image that we know”. What we see on the Serpentine’s screens at any one time is “a chimera made out of thousands of past images and the present images that are just there for a fraction of a second”. Huyghe shows me a couple of clips on his phone. They’re like something out of deep space or even deeper nightmare: a fleshy, suggestive sump, seething with traces of near recognisable detail.AI does not process images as a human brain might: there’s no associative logic to what might emerge. Near-human intelligence that reveals itself to be subtly non-human is freaky. Huyghe and I discuss the idea of the “uncanny valley” – the zone occupied by entities that are nearly but not quite recognisably human. As humans we tend to find them particularly alarming. (Monster-makers for horror movies understand this perfectly it’s why the most disturbing monsters tend to have attributes that recall Homo sapiens.)Huyghe says the term “uncanny valley” came from “a Japanese guy who was trying to make a kind of android”. “When you do 3D realism, you arrive at a threshold. That threshold is the moment where you’re trying to reach realism but there’s this tiny, tiny something that says it is not, and that’s where the uncanny valley is. It puts you in a very excited mode, because there’s something you start to have empathy with, and of course a part of you says you should not.”Even without a 3D android as persuasive as the one in Alex Garland’s film Ex Machina, Huyghe’s AI will invite intellectual empathy. Pattern recognition isn’t only the preserve of machine learning: we humans do it, too, and we’ll find it hard to resist interpreting the images as they evolve on the LED screens. However, just by standing in the gallery looking at them, we, as components in the Serpentine gallery ecosystem, will have an impact on the overall environment.Then there are the flies. Along with the behaviour, movements and density of human visitors, a set of sensors installed in the gallery will also monitor the behaviour patterns of 50,000 bluebottles introduced into the space.Though 50,000 sounds akin to the fourth plague, the intended effect, curator Rebecca Lewin tells me, is something closer to an “irritating August infestation”. The flies will be fed sugar up in the rotunda, where they are expected to congregate. Unable to breed without the presence of protein, their stock will need replenishing over the course of the exhibition. Purchasing flies in bulk has been one of Lewin’s more unusual curatorial challenges. Human visitors and bluebottles alike will trigger sensors in the gallery, feeding into a “neural network” that will change the pace at which the images on the screens evolve.Huyghe presents himself as an instigator, rather than author. That stance is in keeping with an ego-denting suggestion buried in the work – if deep image reconstruction can generate images from brain activity, it suggests that this brain activity and the images it generates are common to all of us: that something about our imagination is generic. In the field of visual art, that idea is humbling and not a little awkward. What if the mind is not what sets us apart from other people, asks Huyghe.Each of the complex, self-generating ecosystems Huyghe has constructed over the last decade reflects an existing set of real-world relationships. After ALife Ahead repackaged the struggle between the built human environment and the living world couched just beneath its crust. Within it coexisted organisms that were opportunistic (weeds, algae), alien (peacocks), genetically manipulated (GloFish), and mutating (cancer cells).At the Serpentine, a system structured around machine learning offers a controlled microcosm of the world we have just stepped out of, where algorithms predict our behaviour, tracking everything from search words to our physical movements. Of equal, if not greater importance perhaps: within this work, just as outside it, human behaviour has a profound effect on an environment that we share with other living organisms.• Pierre Huyghe is at the Serpentine Gallery, London, 3 October – 10 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d59eb4ded66b0ce184b4aa62f68654bca31eefe1/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8864eadd4803e9f28edbaafc103cb4db 2020w","title":"the sinewy genius of egon schiele in pictures","story":"Gods, wives and lovers … the curator of Egon Schiele, a new show at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, talks through key works by the great Austrian painter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fd82c57bbb5d9f81a297925ca2b68b72951cec/0_83_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a578a68f78242c003e3155877d4fbd32","title":"sports direct house of fraser senior management mike ashley","story":"Dismissal follows calls for investigation into department store chain’s collapseSports Direct, which is controlled by the tycoon Mike Ashley, has dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser, less than two months after buying the department store group from its administrators.In a brusque statement issued to investors after the London stock market closed on Monday, Sports Direct said: “Following the collapse of House of Fraser on August 10 2018, and subsequent calls for an investigation into the circumstances of that collapse, the company today announces that we have dismissed the former directors and senior management of House of Fraser.”Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United Football Club, bought the department store out of administration for £90m in August.

They need a new leader. Some new faces around the cabinet table.Some flashy new policies. And, everyone agrees, they need to stop flicking V-signs at business. But nothing too radical. An oil change, a spray job, and they’ll be motoring again.Political wisdom is often little more than sonorous simple-mindedness, and this is a prime example. Judging by Philip Hammond’s speech to the Tory faithful on Monday, the chancellor doesn’t buy it, either. Humming through his lines was an anxiety about the threat posed by Jeremy Corbyn. Whatever their press releases say, cabinet ministers are stumbling through the Tory conference in Birmingham worried that Labour’s arguments about Britain’s broken economy are hitting home. And with good reason.The Tories sense this widespread pessimism – they just haven’t a clue what to do about it. Party activists in Birmingham this week willingly bet that this conference is Theresa May’s last as leader while voicing no confidence that whoever succeeds her will do any better.“We are a dead party,” says Nick Denys, a councillor from Hillingdon and head of policy for the Tory Workers group, whose other members include Ruth Davidson and Robert Halfon. “Even our membership is literally dying. What do we have to offer families of working age?” And that is a key question. Because the problems facing this party are fundamental – and they have been made by Tories.Smack-bang in the middle of a crisis of capitalism, May has positioned the Tories as the stalwarts of capitalism. While the country cries out for more money, she carries on cutting spending. Such astounding blockheadedness is compounded when the prime minister who told a struggling nurse last year that “there is no magic money tree” boasts this week of her plans for a £120m festival of Brexit. You can see the damagedone by May right outside the conference hall where she will speak on Wednesday. West Midlands mayor Andy Street says the cuts “have gone far enough” local police say they are close to “breaking point”. Big West Midlands businesses such as the carmaker Jaguar Land Rover warn of the harm that would be done by a no-deal Brexit.Underlying this is the deep-rooted problem that the programme pushed by the Conservatives since the 1980s simply hasn’t worked for the very people who used to vote for them. Margaret Thatcher promised a shareholder democracy – but inidual ownership of shares is below where it was when she began her privatisations. She pledged a country of homeowners – but home ownership in England has fallen to its lowest point since 1985.What Tory policies have done is concentrate wealth, power and opportunity in ever-fewer hands – thus cannibalising their voter base. Party grandees sometimes talk about an electoral ladder from youthful firebrand to grey-haired Conservatism. You get a job, you buy a house, get into middle management – and as you get more of a stake in society you become more reactionary. Or so the theory goes. Except every one of those rungs is now broken. Graduates can’t get graduate-level jobs. Settling down is almost impossibly expensive. No wonder the natural age of Labour voters keeps rising.To see how this works in practice, ignore the autocued remarks made in Birmingham this week and think about another speech, made three years ago by a woman in the audience for Question Time. Perhaps you remember Michelle Dorrell: dressed in a grey jacket and minding her Ps and Qs, she suddenly exploded at the then-cabinet minister Amber Rudd for defending cuts in tax credits.Dorrell told Rudd that she’d voted Tory six months earlier – but now she was furious. “I work bloody hard for my money to provide for my children … and you’re going to take it away from me and them. I can hardly afford the rent, the bills and you’re going to take more from me.” And audience members in Dover started chanting at Rudd: “Shame on you! Shame on you!”At the time, I wrote on these pages that that was a seminal moment in the politics of austerity: the point at which the government could no longer pretend that the cuts were happening only to shirkers. And Dorrell was exactly the kind of natural Tory voter the party could ill afford to lose.Dorrell told me this weekend that she’d never planned to go off like that, but when Rudd spoke she felt “a force from inside my belly”. She’d lost her job in 2011, had to go through the horror of the benefits system and then retrained and set up a nail bar. She’d played it by the book, done everything the Tories told her to do – and still she was, to use an old phrase, just about managing. Instead of birthday and Christmas presents, her dad would buy £100 of food from Sainsbury’s or Lidl and restock the fridge.At first business went well, but the economy in her hometown of Folkestone is as moribund as anywhere else in non-metropolitan Britain. She’s just closed her nail business and works in a local shop on a zero-hours contract, getting eight to 12 hours of shifts a week. She needs more, but the manager says the company will never give her 16 hours because they don’t want to pay employers’ national insurance. She still needs benefits to top up wages, yet the benefits system keeps getting meaner. In April 2011, 6.4 million families were on tax credits, according to Carl Emmerson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. By this April that was down to 3.8 million: of those losing out, a tiny number may have moved to universal credit – but many millions more simply got poorer.Dorrell, who is in her late 30s, describes herself as “a child of Thatcherite economics”. Her parents are Tory, her hometown is Tory. And in the 1980s, someone like her might have gone along with the Conservatives’ promises. In the last couple of years she’s become radicalised, joining Labour and Momentum.She talks about local GP surgeries closing and overcrowding in classrooms. Talking to me, she looks out of her bedroom window on to a car park where drug dealers hang about. Her children are still playing by the rules – and getting punished for it. Her eldest daughter is at university, set to graduate with £65,000 of debt. For her children, austerity is all they’ve known – at home, in the classroom, at the start of their working lives. What the winter of discontent was to the Labour party for a decade – the indelible stain, the warning at the ballot box – the decade of cuts may prove to be for May’s party. “The Tories are screwed for a generation, aren’t they?” says Dorrell. “My kids will grow up knowing they’ve been screwed over by that lot.”• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c9ef71fc008f8344e82494b9a315b086831495/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0eb0452319568bcfd44fbdad1d61ece","title":"theresa may speech party conference brexit","story":"Who would be her? At the Conservative party conference her party of lemmings strain at the leash to plunge over a Brexit precipice. She has little to lose by confronting them head on – and saving her country while she can. Here’s the speech Theresa May could make on Wednesday:“There are times when prime ministers are called upon to make monumental decisions – on war and peace or on the economic future of our children and grandchildren. When the country faces a grave peril it falls to a leader to meet it without fear or favour to particular factions, ignoring threats to their personal survival. I am well used to this now.Stepping into No 10, I took on a country in a state of shock a country so bitterly riven it seemed as if it might be beyond holding together. But I have tried my utmost. Now we have reached a political deadlock: within this party, in parliament and with EU negotiators.It can be lonely when there is a clamour from all sides urging wildly different courses of action. This has gone beyond orthodox politics. Only a forensic examination of risks and opportunities can guide me now. You know I am not driven to hold on to this job at all costs. My intent is to take us through this so we emerge with the most hope and the least harm done. I will not go on and on – but I will go on until Brexit is fully resolved. That’s my duty.Our history proves us the natural party of government, in power except when we grow complacent. Through our own folly, we now risk relinquishing power again. When Jeremy Corbyn claims to embody the new common sense, we should be laughing out loud.One strand of our party has led us astray. A kind of mania has distorted our pragmatic traditions, holding Brexit to be a miracle cure for every problem and only satisfied with an extreme form of departure from the EU.“Preposterous” and “deranged” are not the kind of words I use. But your Canada model means long checks at every border, not just in Ireland. It will be the despair of industry. It will grievously damage the interests of farmers and manufacturers. Let us know when you invent your unicorn technology to wave all traffic through.I tried to accommodate all sides. Perhaps I tried the impossible. Now it’s time to break the deadlock with a compromise that will be no one’s first choice, but which is gaining support. Call it everyone’s plan B, because it avoids everyone’s worst fears. Brexit must happen, but without harm. We will seek to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association, asking for associate status, such as that once enjoyed by Finland. We will stay close to the single market, in the customs union, as Jersey is. Call it the Jersey plan. But we stay free of the EU common agriculture and fisheries policies.EEA free-movement rules give us greater control over our borders. There would be no free movement of citizens, only free movement of workers: only those with a job can move here. This will address the concern that EU citizens come here to beg or to be a burden. Migrants with jobs bring prosperity.This EEA associate status would be temporary, a fixed three-year transition for negotiations. Our sovereign parliament always has power to change it. Our European neighbours will welcome frictionless borders for free-flowing trade, and no threat to the unity of the United Kingdom or of a hard border within the island of Ireland. Make no mistake, this is Brexit. No one knows which Brexit people voted for, but I do know most people want this done and dusted.Offered this compromise deal, I trust enough of my MPs’ common sense to assert itself: to concentrate their minds, they should just glance over at the opposition. I believe MPs across the House will rally to this EEA associate option, regardless of their leaders’ positions. Every MP carries the same responsibility as I do for seeing the country through this.But if MPs reject a deal, then the only option is to put this to the people and rely on their good sense.”Could she? Would she? From all we know of her, Theresa May has no such agility or political imagination. History will record her as the worst of prime ministers if she drags the country down to a bad Brexit. But there is just time for her to rescue her legacy – and us – with a historic act of bravery.

Oxford and Cambridge brush the top of any international ranking, with another three or four of our universities on their heels. True, the US does better, but not for its size, and no other country comes close. The UK hasn’t done so well in anything since Geoff Hurst’s hat-trick and the Beatles and the Stones. Not even cycling or dressage can compete.Sam Gyimah, appointed to the job in January 2018, faced a choice. Should he work with the sector to build on its strengths, or treat it as a delinquent infant in need of a good talking to, in the tradition of his immediate predecessor, Jo Johnson?So how has it all worked out? In accordance with good HR practice, a probationary appraisal is due. And let’s be up to date, and do a 360 review: a review from all around. I hereby appoint myself to speak on behalf of those below, in the universities.Gyimah’s appointment made academics sit up. True, he is yet another former president of the Oxford Union and PPE graduate. But he spent his early life between England and Ghana, and was one of the first male students at the former women’s college Somerville. There was a frisson that he might be sensitised to issues of equality and ersity, where the sector has recently had something of a kicking.Would he stir things up? Well, up to a point. He has added his voice to those rightly complaining about the poor record in minority recruitment at Oxbridge, but his main interest in ersity concerns voices on campus. He has continued to fan the flames of freedom of speech, safe spaces and no-platforming. For example, in a major speech to the vice-chancellors on 5 September he was reported as warning of the rise of a “monoculture” on campus, with the suppression of conservative and pro-Brexit views, though the published version of the speech is more carefully expressed.That speech does show an appreciation of the sector and its strengths, achievements, and key risks. Yet there may be a suspicion that one thing he learnt from his Oxford tutorials is that if you want people to listen, you had better temper your criticism with praise. And apart from the concern for free speech, Gyimah’s main message is that universities must deliver value for money to students, or face something unspecified but rather nasty from the regulator, the Office for Students.Gyimah has also, importantly, urged universities to do more to address issues of mental health, though his suggestion that they act in loco parentis is a poor substitute for a searching discussion of what it is about a university environment, such as the brutal examination system, that could trigger mental health problems.More recently, the minister rapped VC knuckles for not proactively searching for research funds to replace those threatened by Brexit. The universities’ reply is that the government had assured them that any lost EU funding would be replaced by UK funds. And VCs have been half-hearted in seeking alternative sources because they have no idea where to look for cash on the needed scale. The game has turned to not where will the money come from, but who will be to blame when it runs out? So where are we after nine months of a new minister? My sense is that the sector’s view is little has changed. We are hunkering down under the same old complaints, with no fruitful new ideas. Research funding is under threat and the future of international student recruitment uncertain. And don’t get me started on student fees and debt.

We’ve achieved what we really set out to achieve.”The lack of women at the top was highlighted by the fact that only one other restaurant with a female head chef – Sabot, in Mayfair, central London, where Nieves Barragán is in charge – was awarded any new stars in the 2019 guide.Smyth told the : “It’s nice to be out there and doing it for female chefs. We just need to encourage more women to come into the industry and if I can help inspire other people to do that, I think it makes our whole industry better.”Commenting on the fact that only one other female head chef was honoured at the ceremony, she said: “It’s probably a reflection of the number of women in the industry. We need more women to come into the industry.”Ramsay said: “She’s tremendous – she’s the Margaret Thatcher of cooking. She knows what she wants and she comes from a good stable. To get two stars straight away – there are chefs who have been cooking for 30 years and haven’t got two stars – is a testament to her capabilities.”Smyth, who catered for 200 people at the royal wedding evening reception on 19 May, was made an MBE in 2013 for services to the hospitality industry. She served “posh burgers” and pork belly with candy floss for guests including Sir Elton John, the Beckhams, George and Amal Clooney, and Serena Williams.Smyth left her family’s farm between Ballymena and Belfast when she was 16 to study catering at Highbury college in Portsmouth. She then worked at Sir Terence Conran’s Michelin House restaurant, the French Laundry in California and Per Se in New York, before becoming chef patron at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in 2007.At Restaurant Gordon Ramsay she became the first and only female chef to run a British restaurant with three Michelin stars – one of only seven women globally to have held the coveted rating. The Michelin inspectors said they were “bowled over by the depth of flavour … all of your cooking delivers”.Two other restaurants were newly awarded two stars, though unlike Core, both Moor Hall in Aughton, west Lancashire, and Kitchen Table at Bubbledogs in Fitzrovia, central London, previously had one star.In all, 21 restaurants were newly awarded one star and three were newly awarded two stars, which is believed to be a record. There were no restaurants reaching four in the UK, and 100 or so globally that have three stars.Reflecting a growing trend, a number of pubs – or former pubs – were awarded one star, including the Chestnut in west Cork, one of three places in the Irish city to get a star, and the White Swan just outside Burnley in Lancashire.Brat also won a star, having opened in a former strip club in Shoreditch, east London, where it offers Basque-style cooking over an open fire.There was also a star for Salt in Stratford-on-Avon, which was launched after a kickstarter campaign. The head chef, Paul Foster, said: “I took a risk, left my job, told my wife – she wasn’t very happy … we got a hundred grand, we put everything into the restaurant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6575c4dfd08dce9385da44044edcfbde1d6caa2a/390_447_7674_4604/master/7674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c33c5efb4d7cbae9adb0fdf055c16d06","title":"thomasina miers recipe for tomato and chicken traybake","story":"Be inspired by the gutsy, rich cooking of the MediterraneanI have a friend with an extraordinary kitchen garden in Suffolk. All summer, her many tomato plants have been in their element, with ripe fruit hanging heavily from their branches, wafting their sweet aroma all around. The scent is intoxicating, one that the refrigerated tomatoes of winter certainly don’t have. So, now that we are at the end of the season, eat as many tomatoes as you can. 8-10 chicken thighs, on the bone and skin onSalt and black pepper6 large tomatoes (such as beef or oxheart)4 garlic cloves, unpeeled4 sprigs thyme1½ tbsp small capers12 black olives (preferably kalamata), stoned½ tsp dried chilli flakes (optional)4 anchovies5 tbsp olive oil150g stale white sourdough, torn into large piecesFor the basil oil1 large bunch each basil and parsley, leaves picked4 anchovies2 tsp capers8 tbsp olive oil4 tbsp red-wine vinegar2 garlic cloves, peeledHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Remove the chicken from the fridge, lay it on a plate and season generously with salt and pepper. Leave out for half an hour.Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes into large chunks and transfer to your largest baking tray. Scatter the garlic cloves over the tomatoes, along with the thyme, capers, olives, chilli and three tablespoons of olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper, mix with your hands, then roast in the oven for 10 minutes.Remove the tray from the oven and scatter the bread all around. Toss with the tomatoes and juices, then top with the chicken thighs. Drizzle the whole lot with the remaining two tablespoons of oil. Roast for a further 25-30 minutes, turning the bread pieces over once or twice.Now make the basil oil, whizzing all the ingredients together. If you want a looser consistency, add a few more slugs of olive oil. Taste and check for seasoning – it will be naturally salty so you may only need the smallest pinch of salt.Once the thighs are golden and cooked through, serve in the baking tray, drizzled with the basil oil, or transfer to a serving dish. Serve with a green salad and perhaps some cheese for pudding.Buy trays of tomatoes at the market at the end of the day and make bottles of passata (always useful) or jars of tomato and chilli jam, which is delicious with grilled vegetables, cheese, sausages and lamb."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45a6efc78c28bd2e48cfdb14b81e792db2aa62c/0_87_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f92a8ac08c6b1d90bed2ee927b28bb18","title":"bournemouth crystal palace premier league match report","story":"This was a tight contest that ended in acrimony, with players squaring up in stoppage time and the visitors’ frustration boiling over again as they left the pitch. A late penalty, awarded after Mamadou Sakho flung an arm clumsily into Jefferson Lerma as the hosts swung a hopeful free-kick into the box, had lifted Bournemouth to within two points of the top four in the fledgling Premier League table. For Crystal Palace, now beaten four times, the picture looks grimmer.It was the carelessness of the concession that must have infuriated Roy Hodgson. His team had fought their way back to parity, albeit with a goal that a VAR would have ruled out for offside, only for their tempo to drop just as the game was there to be won, inviting late pressure as a result. Wayne Hennessey had done wonderfully well to deny Callum Wilson with his left leg, the striker having scurried on to Ryan Fraser’s pass beyond a ramshackle backline, and then to parry Dan Gosling’s header from a centre. The pivotal free-kick was awarded against Alexander Sorloth in the confusion that followed, with Palace’s composure having drained away.That did not excuse the offence. Sakho had already shoved Lerma away as the teams jostled for position on the edge of the penalty area waiting for Fraser’s delivery, earning a warning from the referee, Mike Dean. Surely it was obvious the official would be scrutinising that duel when the dead-ball was eventually taken, yet the Frenchman still glanced and flung back his elbow and forearm to connect with the Colombian while the ball sailed harmlessly into the penalty area. Junior Stanislas, a substitute who had yet to have a touch, grabbed the ball and converted the spot-kick.Everything Palace mustered thereafter was played out through a red mist. Hodgson claimed the free-kick conceded had been “needless” but suggested Sakho’s misdemeanour had been clumsy rather than malicious. “Mamadou has no intention to elbow the player, or use the elbow to stop the player getting to the ball,” he said. “But I can’t deny that, when you see it on the television, he does catch the player and, as a result, the referee is quite within his rights to award the penalty.” Howe, relieved his team’s furious opening and energetic finale had secured the points, had not seen a replay of the incident.He could revel in a hard-fought win, with the tweaks he had made to his side after Palace’s equaliser having had the desired effect. There was plenty to admire in their display through two spells of superiority. Their opening had threatened to blow the visitors away, when Josh King and Wilson were unsettling James Tomkins and Sakho, and Fraser and David Brooks drove Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Patrick van Aanholt back into their shells. Brooks in particular caught the eye and it was the Wales international – who won best player at the 2017 Toulon Tournament while with England – whose first Bournemouth goal had put Bournemouth ahead.The winger had already fizzed one low centre across the six-yard box by the time Adam Smith, operating from left-back, scuttled down the flank and squared for Wilson five minutes in. The striker, with his back to goal, calmly laid the ball across the area where Brooks, in space away from Van Aanholt, whipped a fine first-time shot beyond Hennessey and in off the crossbar.“He’s a goalscorer in waiting, so that was a big moment for him,” said Howe of his £11.5m signing from Sheffield United. “He’s not been overawed or phased. He’s attacked it. That’s a very special thing to do at such a young age.”Palace at least recovered some poise, even if they only really clicked for a 20-minute period either side of the interval when their midfield, with Max Meyer eager to accept possession on his first top-flight start and Luka Milivojevic more like his old self at the German’s side, wrested back some level of control. That spell yielded their goal, Wilfried Zaha spinning in possession to slip Van Aanholt beyond Simon Francis. The Dutchman was in an offside position as he glided free but, with no assistant’s flag forthcoming, checked back inside and ripped a right-foot finish emphatically into the top corner via Asmir Begovic’s fingertips.Yet that was only this side’s fifth of the campaign and, with Zaha swamped by markers and not given a presentable opportunity all evening, they appear worryingly toothless. Jordan Ayew is industrious but hardly a predator. James McArthur, asked to push forward from midfield, has snatched at his half-chances to date this season. It is at times like these when a Christian Benteke-shaped hole gapes in their lineup, even if he is a player whose confidence is brittle after only three goals in 34 top-flight appearances. There is currently no presence to alarm opposing defenders. The hope is the knee injury which has hampered the Belgian of late will have cleared up after the international break. For all that his critics will protest, Palace are weakened without him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b782dc88540ebb0ca0647585b2e1c329e8ee83/0_17_2352_1410/master/2352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57e3e20103054fd1154ffc9a5e93d85","title":"cristiano ronaldo accuser spells out claims in magazine","story":"Kathryn Mayorga talks to German magazine about allegations that footballer raped her in 2009Kathryn Mayorga, the woman who alleges that Cristiano Ronaldo raped her, has revealed extensive details of the events she claims took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.The 34-year-old teacher claims the superstar footballer forced her to have sex with him in the bathroom of his penthouse suite, despite repeatedly being told not to. Mayorga also revealed the protracted legal process by which she subsequently agreed to settle the claims. It was an agreement which, her lawyers claim, was never honoured by Ronaldo and contains documents that prove he knew she had not consented.Ronaldo has vehemently denied all the allegations.Mayorga said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine that she had chosen to go public in the wake of the #MeToo revelations. By breaking her end of the agreement, she may now face the possibility of having to pay back $375,000 awarded to her eight years ago, on top of legal fees, in an out-of-court settlement reported by Der Spiegel.The alleged assault occurred in the summer that Ronaldo left Manchester United for Real Madrid to become the then most expensive player in the world. He went on to enjoy unparalleled success in Spain, forging a reputation as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He captained Portugal to victory in the European Championships of 2016 and this summer completed a £90m transfer to Juventus in Italy.In the interview, Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo met her in a nightclub, Rain, where she was working and invited her back to his hotel room. He then forced her to have anal sex with him after she had rebuffed a series of advances.“Basically he ... he begged me to touch his penis for 30 seconds,” she said. “I was laughing at him because I thought, ‘Is this a joke? This guy that is so famous and so hot ... he’s a frickin’ loser and a creep.’”Mayorga said she agreed to kiss Ronaldo on the understanding he would then leave her alone, but that instead he increased his assertiveness and began groping her, before finally forcing her into sex. She claimed she said no several times, but he ignored her.“After he assaulted me, he wouldn’t let me leave again. He wouldn’t let me leave”, Mayorga told Der Spiegel.Mayorga allegedly filed a complaint with Las Vegas police the next day. But she refused to name her assailant. She says she was then in shock for three months before ultimately determining to draw a line under the matter by agreeing to a settlement.The many documents that comprised this agreement included questions asked of Ronaldo by his own lawyers. According to Der Spiegel, an earlier version of the questionnaire he was asked to fill out allegedly includes an admission from Ronaldo that “she said no and stop several times”. It is not known whether such an admission was included in the final version of the questionnaire.As part of the settlement, Mayorga allegedly wrote a letter to Ronaldo that his lawyers were obliged to make sure he had read within a fortnight of the agreement. It is asserted by Mayorga’s lawyers, Der Spiegel reports, that this commitment was never fulfilled.According to Der Spiegel, the money that was paid to Mayorga as part of the settlement came from a bank account in the tax haven of British Virgin Islands, registered to a company that had held Ronaldo’s earnings from advertising and sponsorship.Ronaldo categorically denies all the allegations and says that sex between the pair was consensual.Ronaldo’s lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the Spiegel report “is manifestly illegal and violates the personal rights of our client Cristiano Ronaldo in an extremely serious way” and is “one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c6409216baa5a98690a8af29da3939522a1035/0_95_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd31ee8219188c4f5f5925532af1c8dc","title":"jose mourinho manchester united valencia champions league","story":"From the selection of personas available to him in times of alleged crisis, José Mourinho chose the sunny, upbeat one for the press conference ahead of the Champions League meeting with Valencia that could, theoretically, turn into his last game in charge.He wore white instead of black, the smile was on full beam, he helpfully held up his phone and pointed out the man from the Sun when a Spanish reporter asked whether Zinedine Zidane had really been in touch, and in response to another Iberian question about whether he was failing at Manchester United he made a joke about being on the same level as their beloved Atlético Madrid.Was this a big week for Manchester United? “If it is the Champions League it is always a big week and a good week,” Mourinho said. “Not everyone gets to play Champions League games so you should always look forward to them even if you are expecting a difficult match.”Valencia are even lower in the La Liga table than United are in the Premier League and on current form would not ordinarily be regarded as difficult opponents, though it is the wretched form recently shown by Tuesday’s hosts that could be the greater factor in the contest.Not only have United just managed to get knocked out of the Carabao Cup at home against Derby of the Championship, on Saturday they contrived to make West Ham look like world‑beaters, which must have been a bigger surprise to Manuel Pellegrini than the goals gifted to his side at Goodison on his 65th birthday.United are nine points off the title pace just seven games into the season, and to outside eyes at least Mourinho seems to have compounded their worst start for 29 years by conducting public feuds with his players. Paul Pogba was substituted at the weekend and Alexis Sánchez dropped altogether, the Chilean reportedly furious about being taken to London and made to sit in the stands.Perhaps more damaging still are the suggestions that United’s present lethargy – statistics showed they made fewer sprints at West Ham than any other team in the Premier League last weekend – might be a deliberate attempt to undermine the manager’s position. The conclusion being drawn is that what happened to Mourinho in his final season at Chelsea is happening all over again in Manchester, though that could be an oversimplistic analysis.The manager has given his players public backing, claiming he has never known a dishonest professional, and asked them to step up their performances against Valencia. So the proof should be in the pudding.“The manager is trying to turn this around, he wants to make us stronger,” said Nemanja Matic, a player who was at Chelsea with Mourinho the last time things went awry and one who declined to comment on whether he was experiencing any sort of deja vu.“It’s not my job to analyse that,” the midfielder said diplomatically. “The players all know the situation is not good and we know we can do better. Everyone is trying to give more and hopefully Valencia will be a chance to show that.”The normally reliable Serbian was as hard on himself as his teammates when reflecting on Saturday’s defeat. “We did not play well, Saturday was not good and I think I played one of the worst games I’ve had since joining Manchester United,” Matic said. “If I looked in the mirror it was to tell myself I could do better.“We made mistakes, for sure the manager will be telling us about them, but I don’t believe any player goes on to the pitch not wanting to give his best. It is never easy when you lose games, especially when you are at a big club where everyone expects you to win. There is pressure on us now, but to be honest there is always pressure in football.“When you are at a club like this, every single day is a new challenge, in every game you play you have to prove all over again that you deserve to wear the shirt and you are worth your place on the pitch.”Matic did not deny that the United players had been talking about the situation – with Luke Shaw setting the tone with his admission that the ones on the pitch needed “to look at ourselves” rather than looking to the manager for guidance – but the midfielder would prefer action to words, and preferably in the next match.“I don’t think with talking you can resolve something,” Matic said. “You need your leaders on the pitch, the ones who are not scared to play. In the next games we will see who is the leader. Talk in the dressing room doesn’t mean anything. Sometimes it can help but most important is on the pitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee39b89ac219edc437288da97cee4923a8c758cc/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e38a9ede5624d3eb30b9b7a806f9f4b","title":"pep guardiola manchester city hoffenheim champions league","story":"Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City may need to “suffer” in the Champions League group stage to comprehend how difficult progression deep into the competition is, after failing to reach the semi-finals in each of his two years as manager.Under Guardiola’s management City have been eliminated at the last-16 stage by Monaco and the quarter-finals by Liverpool. This was after qualification to the knockout phase was achieved with a game to spare each time. Having lost 2-1 at home to Lyon in the opening Group F match he understands how imperative defeating Hoffenheim at the Rhein‑Neckar-Arena on Tuesday night is.Vincent Kompany stated how claiming the European Cup represents a final frontier for the club under the Sheikh Mansour ownership as City have claimed every domestic trophy at least once. “It’s the last step we haven’t achieved yet and the club is always aiming to progress,” the captain said.“I’m not looking too big into the past. This is a good team, if we play at our level we’ll give ourselves a chance, you can’t ask for more right now.”Kompany has now been at the club for a decade and the Champions League remains the ultimate target. “I’d love to win it with City, but it’s such a tough competition to win,” said the 32-year-old. “It’s OK to say we want to win it but there’s other teams who are just as well equipped to win. We have to deal with fact we lost to Lyon – we worry about Hoffenheim and then if we get momentum, anything is possible.”Hoffenheim finished third in the Bundesliga last season though they are only 11th this season, and lost at home 2-1 to RB Leipzig on Saturday. Sergio Agüero is available despite a heel problem and, while City are at Liverpool on Sunday for a pivotal Premier League meeting, the manager will not consider this when deciding if the striker should start against Hoffenheim.Following a serious knee injury Kevin De Bruyne trained with the squad for a first time Manchester but did not fly to Germany. The Belgian is expected to be available following the international break, which commences after the weekend. Guardiola said: “Kevin is not here because he can’t be. We miss his quality of course, he’s back training – the first time with the team, we’ll see when he’s ready to join the team in the games.”Guardiola ruled out a move for Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappé, following a report that he was interested and that Raheem Sterling may be sold to help finance the deal. “That is not going to happen,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t understand where the news comes from. Manchester City aren’t going to spend the money that Mbappé deserves, or that PSG deserves.“PSG are not going to sell this kind of player to any other club in the world in the next years, I guess. That is not going to happen, Mbappé is not going to come here, we are not going to swap Raheem or another top player that we have.Kompany is out of contract next summer but was reluctant to talk about his future. “It’s not the place or the moment to discuss,” he said. “I’m a player of this wonderful club and I’ve the same duty until the last day. All the rest is speculation as we’ve such an important game tomorrow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

Which means that the only rational explanation for the current behaviour of the Tory party is that most of its members are out of their heads on psychotropic drugs. The Birmingham conference centre has been transformed into the country’s largest crack den, with the entire cabinet and the gobbiest MPs fighting over what’s left of their stash while competing to pass off their version of fantasy as reality.We’ve already had the prime minister proposing we rerun the Festival of Britain to celebrate surviving Brexit. A Cliff Richard austerity singalong with everyone breathing a sigh of relief that they haven’t actually died. We’ve had Boris Johnson, a man who managed to waste £40m of public money failing to build a bridge across the Thames, going full psycho with a plan to build a bridge across the Irish Sea. Not to mention Jeremy Hunt in an advanced paranoid state claiming that we were in a gulag run by the EU.This wasn’t just a one-off, first-day collective meltdown, as every subsequent speaker appears to have taken all this as a benchmark of idiocy to which they should aspire.First on the main stage on Monday was Dominic Raab. Such is the febrile atmosphere of this conference that every speech is being viewed as a potential leadership bid, so Theresa May should be grateful that the Brexit secretary went out of his way to rule himself out. Almost certainly completely unintentionally.“The EU needs to get serious and do so now,” he demanded angrily. This didn’t get quite the reaction he had hoped. The hall may have had plenty of empty seats – anyone with a vestige of self-respect has long since run for the hills – but most of those who had chosen to endure the punishment beating just looked blank. No one wanted to be the person to tell Raab it had been the Tory government that had been taking the rise for the past two years and the EU had been deadly serious all along. He then went on to say he had nothing to offer but his blind optimism. No plan, just a wing and a prayer.Chris Grayling is almost always a guaranteed source of stupidity, but even so his performance was still a collector’s item. After insisting the Heathrow decision had been a no-brainer – it had to have been, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to make it – he declared that post-Brexit Britain would be exactly like Monarch airlines. Bankrupt with tens of thousands of people in need of repatriation. Sensing he now had the hall in the palm of his hands, he concluded by saying that his priority was to complete the improvement to slip-roads in Thurrock, presumably so that they can be used as a lorry park. Failing Grayling is an example to us all that you really can be hopeless and still end up in the cabinet.It’s customary for the prime minister to be present for the chancellor’s speech. But as Philip Hammond wasn’t even present for his own gig, May clearly didn’t feel the need. Not for the first time, the Undertaker was completely out of step with his party. While the rest of them were mainlining amphetamines or taking psychedelics, Phil had stubbornly chosen to overdose on barbiturates. Every word was forced out. A struggle against unconsciousness. And not just because he had almost nothing to say. This was Phil as Philler. His final words were that the future laid with AI. You’d have thought the Tories had learned from their experiment with the Maybot.There were equal amounts of inspired lunacy to be found on the fringes. At a lunchtime meeting of the Bruges Group, Priti Patel, Andrea Jenkyns and Owen Paterson – aka Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest: the three desperados fighting over a single brain cell – could be heard reprising their favourite stories about how everyone was trying to prevent the one true Brexit to a near hysterical audience. “We are the mainstream,” said Paterson.

And here’s a safe prediction: in the days and weeks ahead we’re going to hear more of them,” Davidson told delegates in Birmingham.She urged her colleagues to remember what she called “the principles of country, of duty, of practicality and of delivery – the belief that every prudent act is based on accommodation and accord” and support the prime minister’s “practical, pragmatic and utterly Conservative approach” to Brexit.Johnson is due to speak to a packed fringe event on Tuesday when he is expected to urge the party to focus on law and order, tax cuts and housebuilding as well as restating his opposition to the May’s Chequers plan.Johnson’s leadership manoeuvring has angered many in May’s circle who complain that the former foreign secretary is making it harder for the prime minister to conclude the Brexit negotiations. Johnson may be upstaged by the home secretary, Saijd Javid, who signalled on Monday that he would announce details of the party’s post-Brexit immigration policy in a speech timetabled for noon on Tuesday, an hour before Johnson speaks.Javid hinted of a change in policy once free movement from the European Union ends following the conclusion of the transition period in 2021. He told one fringe meeting: “We’ve been an incredibly successful nation for lots of reasons, clearly one of the reasons is our openness … we’ve got to maintain that openness, just in a different way.”Last Monday, the cabinet met to sign off a new post-Brexit immigration system that would offer visas to immigrants in a tiered system based on skills and wealth, an approach that ministers are expected to unveil at the Birmingham conference.Skilled workers will more easily be able to obtain visas than the unskilled andthere will be no preferential access to the UK labour market for EU citizens, although final terms are expected to subject of Brexit negotiations.Davidson’s was the latest of a series of carefully worded interventions on Monday from senior Tory figures underlining the practical benefits of the Chequers approach, in a deliberate contrast to what the chancellor called the “sweeping statements” of Johnson.The business secretary, Greg Clark, delivered his own conference speech from a nearby car factory to underline the importance for manufacturers of preserving frictionless trade.Downing Street hopes Conservative MPs will ultimately decide there is little alternative to throwing their weight behind May’s deal, despite the tumultuous atmosphere in Birmingham.The former education secretary Nicky Morgan suggested she could back an agreement based on Chequers. “The PM has shown such resilience plodding on with this she might well just come back with something that we can all live with,” she said.But Morgan said it was important MPs from the Conservatives’ liberal wing stood firm against Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Eurosceptic followers. “This is a battle that has been coming for the party for the last 25 years and we need to have it,” she said.Many delegates sported “chuck Chequers” badges, and Brexit rebels including Rees-Mogg, Priti Patel and David Davis told enthusiastic audiences that the prime minister’s approach must be ditched.The former environment secretary Owen Paterson repeatedly told delegates “we are the mainstream” as he slammed May’s plans.Earlier in the day, the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, sought to shore up support for Chequers among the party faithful by ramping up the rhetoric against Brussels, accusing the EU27 of showing an inflexible, “theological approach”, to negotiations.A day after the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, sought to burnish his reputation with Tory activists by warning Brussels not to “turn the EU club into a prison”, Raab accused Britain’s negotiating partners of failing to engage with the prime minister’s proposals.His tough language followedMay’s defiant statement in the wake of the unsuccessful Salzburg summit, in which she called for “respect” from her interlocutors.“Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful,” Raab said. “In return, we heard jibes from senior leaders. And we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation. Where the EU’s theological approach allows no room for serious compromise. And yet we are expected to cast aside the territorial integrity of our own country. If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious.”Cabinet ministers are keen to demonstrate they are taking a tough stance, at the same time as backing the prime minister’s Chequers proposals, which critics have suggested represent a surrender to the EU27.But Raab’s remarks sparked irritation in Brussels, where an EU source said both sides had to move if the talks were to progress: “In a way the ball is just as much in the UK’s court as the EU’s. We are at a point in the negotiations when neither side can say ‘the ball is in your court’. If the UK doesn’t pick up the ball, we will.”The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is drafting a non-binding political declaration on the future relationship with the UK. A senior diplomat said “counter-proposal would be “too strong a word” to describe this document, which has been planned for a long time.Linked to that text, Barnier is drawing up “improved” proposals on the Irish backstop. The backstop is the European commission’s fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but May has said no British prime minister could ever accept Barnier’s version, which would keep Northern Ireland subject to many EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99edbcac18e459ebaf4d6484abc1b479cb553d5f/0_296_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016eae00429bbe21bb98c7eabf8a27a1","title":"brooks koepka ryder cup spectator","story":"• Corine Remande, blinded in right eye, may take legal action • ‘Clearly there is responsibility on the part of the organiser’The spectator whom Brooks Koepka hit with a tee shot at the Ryder Cup is considering legal action against the tournament’s organisers after losing the sight in one eye.One of Koepka’s drives on the opening day of the tournament flew towards the crowd and hit Corine Remande. “Doctors told me I had lost the use of that eye,” the 49-year-old told Agence France-Presse. “It happened so fast, I didn’t feel any pain when I was hit. I didn’t feel like the ball had struck my eye and then I felt the blood start to pour. The scan on Friday confirmed a fracture of the right eye-socket and an explosion of the eyeball.”Koepka was quick to make his way over to the crowd and apologise to Remande, who was later treated at an eye hospital in Paris. “Quite clearly, there is responsibility on the part of the organisers,” she said. “Officials did not shout any warning as the player’s ball went into the crowd. More than anything I want them to take care of all the medical bills to make sure there is no risk of infection.”Remande, who had travelled from Egypt to attend the tournament, also criticised the tournament organisers for “not making contact” with her following the incident.

Still, it was impossible to ignore the proving of people wrong when Europe’s successful captain pinpointed a key reason behind Sunday’s victory in Paris. “The picks,” said Bjørn immediately on Monday morning.The selection of that quartet – Paul Casey, Sergio García, Ian Poulter and Henrik Stenson – led to allegations of an old pals’ act on the part of the captain, specifically in the case of the out-of-form García. The delivery of a combined 9½ points, the best aggregate in Ryder Cup history, meant there was more substance to the process than Bjørn had earlier been given credit for. “They delivered,” he said. “That was not down to me it was down to them. They wanted to deliver.”The Dane, now rightly heralded among Europe’s finest captains, revealed his wildcards had no cause to be surprised when their places were confirmed. “I put plans together with them,” he explained. “It was so much easier for me to put plans together with them because I know them so well. I could have conversations with them and know how they work, what they do, what makes them tick, what makes them do the right things coming into it, so we could out-lay plans for them and then go with that. That’s more to Henrik and Sergio than the other two. Paul, when he decided to come back and play in Europe, played in our EurAsia Cup team. That week I spent with him there did so much for him and for me in the way that I knew that he could fit into a team in a really good way.”Bjørn added: “I told Henrik: ‘Be prepared to play two foursomes. You might play more but be prepared to play two foursomes.’ He goes and delivers three points out of three at 42. It’s a pretty impressive thing to do when you’ve not had the greatest of seasons. With Sergio I felt if I could give him a pick, then that would boost him to go on and do things. I was pushing him. I kept pushing him to making him feel like he needed to do the work.“You’ve got to remember, he’s now the all-time leading points scorer for Europe. Even if he had not won any points here, he’s still won a lot of Ryder Cup points. That takes some doing because we’ve had some really good players that’s won a lot of Ryder Cups. It says a lot about him. I think this will kick him on to do great things next season.”There was no denying Europe’s star man. Francesco Molinari, the Open champion, showed his single-mindedness when opting to play in the PGA Tour’s John Deere Classic rather than in Europe immediately before his triumph at Carnoustie. “I was a bit like, is this the right move?” Bjørn recalled. “I spoke to him about it and he was like: ‘Well, I have to do this for how my year’s planning out,’ so I said to him: ‘I’m a little bit worried about it because I really want you to be on this team.’ I really did on this golf course because I thought it suited him perfectly. For me it would be a perfect foursomes opportunity on this golf course.“I had the conversation with him and he said: ‘For me I have to do this but I promise you I will make the team.’ I got a message on the Sunday night after the Open saying: ‘Is this good enough?’“He’s just gone on from strength to strength since. He’s such an underrated player and he has been for a long time. Now that he’s got the confidence that he has as a golfer, he can do anything. He showed that this week. He’s phenomenal. He took on the best players in the world – he is one of the best players in the world – and he showed he’s equal to the task.”There was far more to Bjørn’s expert planning. Conscious that the Ryder Cup could be decided by the final singles matches, he played video messages from Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Martin Kaymer to his team. That quartet secured the Ryder Cup from late Sunday positions in 1997, 2002, 2010 and 2012 respectively. “Those guys told the story about what they experienced,” Bjørn added.Sports science and medical strategy was put in place to a fresh, detailed level. “If you had tried that in 2002, the nutritionist wouldn’t have got far,” said the captain with a smile.Bjørn is perfectly happy to admit a 17.5 to 10.5 thumping by Europe was beyond his wildest dreams. “If you sit and home and think that’s a score, that would be borderline arrogant against that team,” he said. “There was a time on Sunday where it looked like 14.5 to 13.5 on the prediction.“Once it kind of pans out that we have won it, it goes a bit flat for the Americans. I thought it was tight and I thought it was going to be really tight. We knew we had to be at our best to win it.”As further evidence of disharmony within the United States camp appeared, pictures emerged of a typically boisterous scene at a European victory party, where Nick Grimshaw delivered a DJ set. Earlier Bjørn’s team members had formed a WhatsApp group to exchange motivational messages an image of Justin Thomas wearing a T-shirt with ‘Beat Europe’ emblazoned across the front is known to have featured.Bjørn is not yet clear what the future holds, such was his commitment to this cause. “I’m going to enjoy the next two months,” he said. “I might have to wait until we get into 2019 to make any concrete decisions on what I’m doing next but right now I just want to go and lie on a bed for a few weeks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0add7c4a25cd7347717925452f9e1f113078c15/0_16_5057_3034/master/5057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f2aa7a19914b0432def93129e717343","title":"mercedes team orders leave a sour taste in sochi as ferrari struggle again lewis hamilton f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton’s victory in Russia was not ideal but nor was it a repeat of Austria 2002. The Scuderia have much to ponderThe spectre of Austria 2002 continues to hang over every instance of teams employing orders. When Ferrari made Rubens Barrichello move over for Michael Schumacher it was a decision of such cynical overkill it rightly remains infamous. At that point the season was only five races old, Schumacher had won four of them and had twice as many points as his nearest challenger, Juan Pablo Montoya. It was simply unnecessary. Team orders were banned afterwards but it was a rule that proved unenforceable and since 2011 they have been legal. In Russia Mercedes’ decision to make Valtteri Bottas cede his place and the win to Lewis Hamilton was not what anyone wanted to see but in what has always been a team sport it was, for them at least, necessary and understandable – incomparable to 2002. Hamilton enjoys a strong advantage but remains only a DNF from becoming vulnerable again, making every point vital.That Mercedes’ decision to enforce team orders was not pre-ordained however seems clear. The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted he could not sleep on Saturday night, disturbed by memories of what happened in Austria 16 years ago. The team had discussed options before the race but ultimately appeared to be happy to let their drivers compete. Had they intended a switch, pitting Hamilton first for the undercut on Bottas would have been the simplest method and least damaging in terms of publicity. But they did not do so, stuck to their plan and were forced to take the hard decision when Hamilton’s blistering tyres threatened his position. Bottas admitted he had not been expecting the call and found it confusing. Mercedes should be lauded for letting them race but perhaps simply making it clear to the Finn that he would be expected to move over before the race began might have made it easier on him.Mercedes’ ruthless and clear use of orders was an object lesson to the Scuderia, who were hesitant and ambiguous in instructing Kimi Räikkönen to move over for Sebastian Vettel in Germany. As things stand, Ferrari will not be in a position to use them again. Räikkönen looks in no danger of exerting any influence on the fight at the front and even less likely to be amenable to orders now his time with the team is up at the end of this season. Worse still Ferrari, having soundly beaten their rivals in their strongholds of Canada, Britain and Spa, were badly off the pace in Russia. Having repeatedly taken a lead through upgrades across the season, their new package at Sochi was no match for Mercedes. On this form a dispirited Vettel has little hope of taking the fight to Hamilton. He and Ferrari must rue the races that slipped away since Silverstone, when they had a clear advantage.In contrast Mercedes have found just the right time to take their car to a new high. They, too, brought upgrades to Sochi, proving the development war remains in full flight, and it appears their work has really paid off. They were exposed by exit speed from slow corners at Spa but, having acknowledged the problem and looked for mechanical solutions, their exit-traction out of slower corners appeared to have improved radically in Russia. This gives them greater speed on following straights, such as the start-finish run after turn 18 at Sochi. It was here Hamilton was able to close and attack Vettel. He made it stick through turn four having gone round the outside of turn three, an indication that perhaps they have found more from their engine, to match Ferrari’s previous advantage. Mercedes are proving a finely honed, relentless force, able to draw on the experience and cohesion of the past four seasons of dominance.One positive for Ferrari from Russia was another superb performance from their new signing for 2019, Charles Leclerc. The 20-year-old was barely on the radar during the race but, in taking seventh place for Sauber, laid down another marker for what Ferrari can expect next season. What was most impressive was how Leclerc turned his weekend around. He had struggled in both the first two practice sessions, unable to find the set-up and control he needed. Yet he worked at it and by FP3 was dialled-in. He converted that to seventh in qualifying and then in the race produced a breathtaking move round the outside of turn three to overtake Kevin Magnussen and maintained his place to be first home behind the big six. He has never driven at Sochi before and his progress over the weekend demonstrated a maturity beyond his years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7316bb90c997b8fc828b344729cfa814b4b218b7/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4d0a7b20a6fada75f939bbf3777f0a6","title":"the lost ocasey review dublin theatre festival anu productions","story":"Dublin theatre festivalA forgotten play by Seán O’Casey inspires Anu Productions’ immersive journey through a dilapidated block of flatsTwo or three return visits would be required to piece together Anu Productions’ latest work, staged on the streets of Dublin and in a dilapidated complex of flats due for demolition. Each audience member is led by the cast on a separate trajectory through an intensely immersive experience. It leaves us unsure where the performance begins and ends, but with a heightened awareness of social injustice. Director Louise Lowe, designer Owen Boss, and an ensemble of nine superb actors bring us close to personal histories of the marginalised.Returning to the north inner-city setting of their acclaimed Monto Cycle, this multidisciplinary company bring their unflinching gaze to the housing and homelessness crisis. A forgotten play by Seán O’Casey, Nannie’s Night Out, is their starting point for a portrait of lives of acute deprivation in Dublin today. A work-in-progress excerpt in June took the form of a play-within-a play, performed in the backstage recesses of the Abbey theatre, where O’Casey’s drama was originally produced in 1924.In the new iteration, little is left of the specifics of Nannie’s Night Out, but its furious social commentary and themes of addiction and homelessness persist. Nannie (Sarah Morris) is a chronic alcoholic living on the streets, in and out of emergency wards with her face bruised from fights. “I’m going to leave a Nannie-shaped hole in the Liffey,” she says. Raucous, funny and defiant, she tells her story of abuse and childhood neglect to a sympathetic doctor (Leanna Cuttle) in a mobile medical clinic. From here, the action shifts to the dishevelled rooms and stairwells of the flats, whose residents have all been given eviction notices.Encompassing violence, mental illness, grief for a death that might be suicide, and a young boxing champion’s shocking fall from a roof, the narrative becomes impressionistic and fragmentary. Carl Kennedy’s sound design and Sue Mythen’s choreography powerfully evoke a hallucinatory mood, as the ensemble of five young men stagger through a haze of drugs and alcohol, blotting out the daylight in an airless room. Asked where he will move to, one of them says: “Your guess is as good as mine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36c7f747543df0b8b9673cff9cf22422366bd36/0_0_6570_4380/master/6570.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e84f0d3648b0351ad84b89725c5009b 700w","title":"google launches new nest e smart thermostat install yourself","story":"Heating controller cheaper than previous model and consumers will not require a boiler engineer to install itGoogle’s latest smart-home product is a cheaper smart thermostat that anyone can install themselves without the need for a boiler engineer.The new £199 Nest E learning thermostat is a two-part system consisting of a battery-powered heating controller called the Heat Link E, which replaces an existing wired thermostat or heating controller, and a smart thermostat that can be placed somewhere else in your home.Lionel Guicherd-Callin, Nest’s head of product marketing in Europe, described the installation as being on the same level as swapping out a light switch or light bulb.The Nest Thermostat E is one of the first that can be installed by a bit of DIY, rather than calling a heating engineer. Two wires are taken out of an existing thermostat or heating controller and plugged directly into the battery-powered Heat Link E. There’s no need to actually get inside the boiler, although mains power still needs to be turned off before the wires are disconnected from the current equipment.The Nest app on a smartphone or tablet will run through step-by-step instructions on precisely how to do it, with tools included in the box.The Nest Thermostat E is then placed somewhere else in the home, normally in the room where most time is spent, plugged into a standard mains outlet and placed on a stand on a table top. The two temperature sensors, one in the Heat Link E and one in the thermostat, can then work together to ensure even heating.A US version of the Nest Thermostat E was launched in August last year, with a similar, more subtle design than the original stainless steel Nest devices. However, Guicherd-Callin says that while it resembles the US version the Thermostat E has been redeveloped for Europe to enable this DIY installation.The Thermostat E will also come with a simpler pre-programmed schedule, which has been developed using data from Nest’s existing European customers to be a best fit for most people. It will continue to learn over time, and includes Nest’s other smart features such as True Radiant that measures how long it takes for your radiators to heat up and adjust heating accordingly for a more even temperature.The Nest Thermostat E is available for pre-order in Europe for £199 and shipping by mid-October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d3032931847235de4a3e1c61e6073c8943e2a0/0_36_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=66ca4af780ea762a69b01f85ad5bfd8a 2020w","title":"black earth rising recap episode four who is bobby fischer","story":"Chess references and unlikely trysts are the recurring themes this week as the Ganimana trial implodes and Hugo Blick makes an appearanceLast week’s episode appeared conclusively to wrap up the mystery of the murdered French priest who, it turns out, wasn’t dead after all. It did leave you wondering where this series would go next? This week it opens up on a new front. There’s the arrest of Patrice Ganimana, accused of helping organise the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, andan appearance from series creator Hugo Blick. He plays lawyer Blake Gaines, a man with a seething passion for legalistic amorality and defending the indefensible. As for Michael, he finds himself assailed from all sides by his conscience, his legal nemesis Gaines, the ravages of cancer and even by romantic propositions. It’s as much as his highly developed sense of irony can take.First, the French business is quickly dispatched. Brigadier General Lesage makes a full and thorough confession to the magistrate. Yes, Clement Barré’s death was covered up so as to conceal French involvement in Rwanda. Yes, the charge against Alice was concocted as a means of avenging Alice, who Jacques Barré regarded as responsible for his son’s killing. Cut to Barré’s mansion. As the police and their dogs arrive, a broken Barré – sitting in his son’s preserved room – shoots himself in the head.Kate remains perplexed at the extent of the cover-up. Michael points out to her that English, not French, is now the national language of Rwanda. This is all part of the post-colonial games, still played out by nations whose pride is still hurt.Following a triumphant speech in which Alice celebrates the exposure of her fabricated prosecution as breaking the “yoke” of the west, she presents Kate with another gift: this time, a torn of piece of fabric from the shirt she was wearing when she was found by Ed at the orphanage. The symbolism is obvious – “It’s your past. It belongs to you.” But Kate will come to wonder why Alice “keeps giving me things”. And what did Alice mean when she said: “You’re ready.” Ready for what?And now, the game’s afoot once more. Ganimana has been arrested at a London hospital, where he is being treated for cancer of the brain. He flew in on a false name but, for some reason, used his real name at hospital admissions. In Rwanda, David Runihura takes a call with a western journalist which turns from elation at Ganimana’s capture to pique as the journalist hints that Alice might return to the country a national hero, and possibly threaten the present incumbent’s authority.In another steely but playful encounter with Kate, in which he breaks into a tap-dance, full of the ironic joys of winter, Michael seems to hint that Britain’s impending departure from the EU might have impelled Ganimana to take refuge here. “In six months you’ll need a visa to pop over to (France) for a pack of fags,” he says, implying that Brexit might boost his chances of avoiding extradition. Still, reckons Michael, he’s toast. Blake Gaines, however, who has a touch of Minder’s Inspector Chisolm gone rogue about him, appears pretty nerveless when he confronts the Crown Prosecution Services officer as she presents an arrest warrant to Ganimana at the hospital. Does he know something?In another conversation over Michael’s daughter Hana’s bed, Alice tells Michael she is going to wait for the outcome of the Ganimana case before returning to Rwanda, lest she back the wrong outcome and lose the people’s trust. As the conversation warms, Michael finds himself inviting her to stay at his place she makes a joke about bodily fluids and suddenly they are in a clinch. Both step away from the moment, however.At Westminster magistrates court, Michael meets Gaines, in a testy yet strangely lawyerly exchange. They compare each other to the chess players Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer. Gaines callously advises Michael to drop the case as he knows it will fail. Michael understands why in a frantic call to the Hague. They are dropping the case – all 12 witnesses against Ganimana have pulled out, presumably intimidated into doing so. And witness protection isn’t one of The Hague’s strong points.Back at Kate’s, she lays the fabric of shirt out on her kitchen worktop it oozes blood. (Is that a hallucination?). Michael drops by they try unsuccessfully to open Eve’s suitcase, then enjoy a late-night meal of cornflakes and Bordeaux. Out of nowhere, Kate propositions Michael. This is a stunner as he points out, wasn’t she supposed to be his replacement daughter? She describes him as beautiful she hasn’t seen him pissing blood. He demurs – for now.Meanwhile, Rwanda has made its own move, demanding Ganimana’s extradition to its own domestic courts, given the failure of the Hague to prosecute. This should be good news but as becomes clear in a phone exchange between Michael and Eunice in America, this would also hamper Alice’s chances of becoming president in Rwanda, displacing Bibi Mundanzi – their own, ulterior goal. Consequently, and with heavy heart and stricken conscience, Michael refuses to help David in the extradition. An uncomprehending Kate is appalled at this she takes it as revenge for her making a pass at him. She meets with David herself. Perhaps the file her mother wrote up on Ganimana is in that suitcase?Finally, Kate and Gaines meet, two antithetical creatures. They play the chess game again.

His comments come as Democrats and Republicans clash over whether the bureau will have enough time and scope to conduct a thorough investigation before a high-stakes vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination, which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said would happen by the week’s end.Answering questions about the FBI investigation, the president told reporters he supported a “comprehensive” investigation and had no problem if the bureau interviewed Kavanaugh and a third accuser, who was not included in the initial list of four witnesses whom agents were instructed to question. Yet he said he would allow the Republican majority in the Senate to define its remit.“My White House will do whatever the senators want,” he said. “I’m open to whatever they want. The one thing I want is speed.”He added: “I’m guided by the Senate. I want to make the Senate happy because ultimately they’re making the judgment.”On Monday, the New York Times reported that the White House had authorized the FBI to expand its investigation as long as the bureau finished its work by the end of the week. In a letter addressed to the White House and the FBI, Democrats on the Senate panel identified more than two dozen witnesses, including the third accuser, Julie Swetnick, Kavanaugh, as well as his classmates and friends in college.Trump spoke glowingly of the judge and lamented the “trauma” he said the allegations had inflicted on Kavanaugh’s wife and daughters. The president attacked two Democrats on the committee, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and even suggested that he had seen an unidentified Democratic senator in “very, very bad” and “somewhat compromising” situations. He did not elaborate, other than to say: “I think I’ll save it for a book like everybody else.”Trump said he had “no plan B” if the nomination failed to pass the Senate but he insisted he had an “open mind” should federal investigators determine Kavanaugh lied to the committee.On Sunday, FBI agents interviewed Deborah Ramirez, one of three women who have accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Kavanaugh has vehemently denied all allegations against him.Ramirez alleges Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party at Yale in the early 1980s. Another Yale classmate accused Kavanaugh of being untruthful in his testimony. On Sunday, Charles Ludington, who now teaches at North Carolina State University, said he was “deeply troubled by what has been a blatant mischaracterization by Brett himself of his drinking at Yale”. Ludington said he was a friend at Yale, when Kavanaugh was “a frequent drinker, and a heavy drinker”.“On many occasions I heard Brett slur his words and saw him staggering from alcohol consumption, not all of which was beer,” Ludington said. “When Brett got drunk, he was often belligerent and aggressive.”On Monday, answering reporters’ questions, Ludington went on to say that “Brett has not told the truth” about his past drinking habits and that the judge had “downplayed to a great degree” that he could have drunk to the point of not remembering “what went on”.“I watched him,” he added. “I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he liked beer. And he’s had some difficulty as a young man with drink.”Trump continued: “I’m not a drinker. I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life. It’s one of my only good traits: I don’t drink.”Drawing laughs from the audience, he said: “Can you imagine if I had – what a mess I’d be? I’d be the world’s worst.”At the Senate judiciary committee hearing last Thursday, the first woman to accuse Kavanaugh, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, detailed the attempted rape she said happened at a house party in 1982.Ford has not been contacted by the FBI since then, according to a member of her team. On Monday morning Michael Avenatti, Swetnick’s lawyer, said his client had not been contacted either.Posting a portion of the statement in which Swetnick says Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at parties in the same early 1980s years at which drunken girls were gang-raped, Avenatti said Trump was “purposely preventing the truth from being known”.“This is a threat to our very democracy,” he said.Judge, who Ford said was present during her alleged assault, denies the accusations.At the White House, Trump said he would be fine if FBI agents interviewed Kavanaugh and all of the accusers, including Swetnick.In Boston, protesters gathered ahead of a speech by Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican who demanded the FBI investigation after voting for the nomination to proceed. He is touring New England while exploring a possible run for the White House.Ed Markey, the junior Massachusetts senator, said: “Dr Ford was empowered and she was courageous. She had nothing to gain and everything to lose. She stepped forward to tell her story. Now others are stepping forward to tell their stories about Brett Kavanaugh.”Melissa Tully and Mary Power, both from Hingham, Massachusetts, were holding “#StopKavanaugh” signs. Tully said she had experienced sexual harassment in college, but “nothing compared to what Ford experienced”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d0879a4b28e4b349b4572aee50fbbaec52761e/0_183_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ca132fd0f618a442dc9f8eac6f5d480","title":"result of macedonia referendum is another victory for russia","story":"Western leaders offered closer integration but they were outmanoeuvred by MoscowThe refusal of Macedonia’s voters to endorse a change in their country’s name seems, at first glance, to be a matter of purely local interest. But the result of Sunday’s referendum will be widely seen as a significant victory for Vladimir Putin, a setback for the EU and Nato, and another disturbing example of Russia’s ability and willingness to influence the democratic process in western countries.Increased instability and ision suit Russia’s game plan, according to western analysts. If the referendum had been successful, it would have resolved a dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia’s route to EU and Nato membership. As elsewhere in the western Balkans, notably Serbia, Kosovo and Montenegro, Moscow is determined to prevent further expansion of western influence.For students of the 2016 US presidential election, Russia’s methods in Macedonia look highly familiar. Disinformation campaigns and “fake news”, cyberwarfare and hacking, phoney Facebook and Twitter accounts and secret cash payments – the modern equivalent of communist-era “red gold” – are all alleged to have been used.Russia denies interfering. But western diplomats claimed last month that 40 new posts a day were appearing on Facebook encouraging a referendum boycott. Postings asked “are you going to let Albanians change your name?” – a blatant attempt to stoke tensions with majority-Slav Macedonia’s ethnic Albanian minority.In one incident, football supporters opposed to the name change fought police in Skopje. Some later admitted they had been paid to cause trouble by shadowy figures. A photograph was circulated on social media showing the bruised face of a popular singer. It falsely claimed she had been beaten by police.Mattis’s attempt to bolster the yes vote, backed by $8m in US congressional funding, were complemented by visits by Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Britain’s Foreign Office reportedly provided referendum funds.All sought to assure Macedonians their future security and prosperity were best served by closer integration with the west. But they were out-thought, outspent and outmanoeuvred by Moscow.Russia’s meddling extended to northern Greece, where four diplomats were expelled in July for trying to inflame anti-Macedonian sentiment in Thessaloniki. In 2016, Moscow was accused of trying to mount a coup in Montenegro to prevent it from joining Nato.As elsewhere in Europe, Russia’s influence campaign in Macedonia exploited and complemented rightwing nationalist-populist narratives based on notions of identity, race and the perceived threat of an overbearing EU. And it remains unclear whether Moscow’s actions tipped the balance.The paradox is that, whatever their country is called, a large majority of Macedonians support EU and Nato membership, according to a recent survey. That prospect has receded, at least for now. In the continuing Europe-wide contest for power and influence, Russia just scored again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53a19d602a927447cf87ef65e8ebe249bb2fcf20/0_73_4975_2985/master/4975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d5def13d65f21ef141667ebdbfbfde","title":"how to be good man me too month reading feminist classics","story":"A year after the first Harvey Weinstein revelations, how can men show solidarity with women? One Swedish professor decided it was time for some deep reading“He covered my mouth with his hand and introduced his penis. I thought my last hour had arrived. I had the feeling my stomach was turning.”These are not the words of a woman testifying as part of the #MeToo movement, and they are not the words of Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the US supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week – although the hand over the mouth, if not the reference to the penis, mirror her words. (Kavanaugh denies the allegations.) This is, instead, the experience of a young woman as recounted by the French feminist and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in her 1949 classic The Second Sex.I took that book down from the shelf about a month ago it had sat there, untouched, for years. How many times had I pretended to have read it, nodding knowingly when someone mentioned it at a dinner party, or in a seminar at the Swedish university where I work?A year after the first revelations about the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, I wanted to to sit down and read about women’s experiences, to stay silent for a while, and hopefully learn something. It has been painful to listen to the stories of systematic sexual abuse that have emerged as a result of the #MeToo movement, and also an education it has forced me to see things I had failed to see in the past. Before, I knew sexual assaults were endemic, but I didn’t realise they were this endemic. I also understood that the blame is often put on the victim. But I had never really seen this, not in such a concrete and shockingly visible way.It has been a late awakening and, over the course of the year, a couple of overdue questions emerged: what can men do to show solidarity with women, and what can we do to address a culture of toxic masculinity and begin examining ourselves?There is clearly more than one way to do this. The journalist Richard Godwin has described in the  how, in his quest to examine modern manhood, he found groups where men were doing “breathing exercises, talking about their fathers, pretending to be tigers, leaning in on one another, working out which Jungian archetype we vibed with, and trying to articulate why we all felt so defensive and angry and misunderstood so much of the time”.I opted for a quieter approach, following the advice that, to show solidarity with the movement, you could begin by seriously listening to women. So I decided to spend the month leading up to the first anniversary of the Weinstein revelations reading some feminist classics, which, for inexplicable reasons, I had never got round to. I’m sure there are embarrassing and unflattering underlying reasons for this omission, but I’m not sure what they are. Perhaps it was as depressingly simple as the fact that the works of (white) male authors had always been closer to hand – through reading lists and book reviews and recommendations – than the works of (black) feminist writers.With the help of two editors from this newspaper, a list of 13 books was compiled – far from comprehensive, but including some of the most influential feminist works of the last few centuries. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, 1792 The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir, 1949 The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, 1963 The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer, 1970 Woman Hating, Andrea Dworkin, 1974 Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis, 1981 Sister Outsider, Audre Lorde, 1984 Gender Trouble, Judith Butler, 1990 Feminism Is for Everybody, bell hooks, 2000 Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg, 2013 Men Explain Things to Me, Rebecca Solnit, 2014 Bad Feminist, Roxane Gay, 2014 We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 2014.In early September, I started reading. Halfway through De Beauvoir’s The Second Sex, I came across a passage that seemed to sum up the shocking insight of #MeToo. De Beauvoir writes that almost all young women, including what she calls “well-protected” ones, have been exposed to “regrettable incidents”, which, in conventional circles, are “hushed up by common agreement”.This reminded me of last autumn, and the experience of watching the evening news with my wife and eight-year-old daughter as the welter of #MeToo allegations began. The news anchor read out some of the testimonies that had been shared on social media. Usually, when horrible things are reported, we could, as a well-protected family, who previously lived in Wales, now in Sweden, calm my daughter down by saying that these things hardly ever happen in our neighbourhood. But we couldn’t do that now. These regrettable incidents could not be hushed up by common agreement.De Beauvoir tells the story in her book of a young girl, no more than 10 years old, who is molested by her grandfather. She cannot find the courage to tell her parents. De Beauvoir writes: “Such incidents are usually endured in silence for the little girl because of the shame they cause. Moreover, if she does reveal them to her parents, their reaction is often to reprimand her. ‘Don’t say such stupid things … you’ve got an evil mind.’”I remember reading the detailed allegations against Jean-Claude Arnault, the influential cultural figure who is married to one of the members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize he used to casually call himself the academy’s 19th member. In an article published in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, 18 women came forward to tell their stories. In graphic detail, they described instances of abuse and rape, and like Weinstein, Arnault was accused of exploiting his power to threaten and blackmail women. He was alleged to have targeted, in particular, those who were weak, vulnerable and “damaged”. On Monday, he was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to two years in prison. The other cases were dropped for lack of evidence or because they had exceeded the statute of limitations.Only four of the women who testified against him showed their faces. They were the ones who had rejected him outright when he had tried to grope them in bars and elsewhere. Never before had I quite grasped the shame of being the victim as I did when reading this line, from one of the women who had been raped and did not show her face: “I was ashamed I was one of those he chose as victim, to be one of the ‘damaged’ women.” Worse than simply being the victim, he had chosen her as his victim, because she was “damaged” and too weak to say no.I had known, for a long time, that blame is casually ascribed to women who are attacked. I had known this, in theory, as an abstraction. I wonder why #MeToo had to happen for this to stop being an abstraction to me. This story has, after all, been told a thousand times before. It was there, in large print, in the books I read throughout September. I mean, is it possible to read the following story, from Gay’s Bad Feminist, and still think of shame as an abstraction? She writes about an 11-year-old girl who was raped by a group of boys and men in Texas, and the fact that the New York Times chose to headline their story Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town – as if we should feel sorry for the town and the boys. “It was an 11-year-old girl whose body was ripped apart, not a town,” Gay writes. “It was an 11-year-old girl’s life that was ripped apart, not the lives of the men who raped her.”A few weeks after the allegations against Weinstein began emerging, a liberal columnist in Sweden wrote that we need to distinguish between real victims and fake victims, claiming that, if all women were as thick-skinned as his 19-year-old daughter, there would be no #MeToo. The problem, he wrote, was that too many women want to assume the role of victims. Their problem is that they don’t know how to say no and to stand their ground.“It never crossed my mind to say no or that I should say no, that I could say no,” writes Gay. When she was 12, a boy she thought was her boyfriend started pressuring her to have sex. One day they were riding their bikes in the woods. She didn’t know that his friends were waiting for them by an abandoned hunting cabin. The boy pushed her to the ground and took her clothes off. She was raped by the group, who kept her there for hours. “I felt fear but I didn’t know how to say no.”After she was raped, Gay didn’t say a word to anyone. She didn’t want to get into trouble. “I was a good girl, so that’s what I did.” In class the next day, one of the boys leaned towards her and said: “You’re a slut.”A few days after the liberal columnist said women should be more like his 19-year-old daughter, hundreds of Swedish women, all actors, came together under the hashtag #SilenceAction, publishing a long series of detailed accounts of brutal sexual assault.Here is one of the many testimonies. In a hotel, after a party, a woman is on her way into her room. A man – a world-famous actor – follows her. He pushes her to the floor and throws himself on top of her. “Now he’ll rape me,” she remembers thinking.I wanted to ask the liberal columnist: how would your thick-skinned 19-year-old daughter deal with that?Before #MeToo, I had not really understood the connection between power and sexual abuse. I had seen it, of course. But again, only really in theory, as an abstraction.In Men Explain Things to Me, Solnit writes that she surprised herself once when she began an essay by recounting what was, ostensibly, a funny incident – a man refusing to be interrupted while explaining, in great detail, the content of a book she had actually authored. That same essay ended in her writing about rape and murder. These incidents are situated on a continuum, she argues, which stretches from “minor social misery to violent silencing and death”.“Dead men don’t rape”, read a poster that used to hang over Dworkin’s desk. By the time I’d read a third of the books on the list, I didn’t blame her. In the acerbic pages of Woman Hating, Dworkin writes that, as a woman, you have to ask yourself a number of pressing questions: “Why everywhere the oppression of women throughout recorded history? How could the Inquisitors torture and burn women as witches? How could men idealise the bound feet of crippled women? How and why?”There were books on my list that were not quite as brutal books less concerned with rape and sexual oppression than with the cultural pressure on women and how to be a woman. At the end of Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, she sets out a future “experiment”, by which women would share with men “the advantages of education and government”. In The Female Eunuch, Greer argues that women need to stop seeing themselves as wives and mothers because, confined to these roles, their “horizon shrinks to the house, the shopping centre and the telly”. By 2013, Sandberg, the chief operating officer at Facebook, was writing from a business perspective about the need for more women in leadership roles. Her advice to women, expressed in the title of her book, is to lean in – to do what you would do if you weren’t afraid.I nodded my way through these books, recalling the discussions that started at my university about a year ago when, emboldened by what seemed like a revolutionary moment, we discussed a range of radical ideas to facilitate the career possibilities for women, from offering significant research time to women to recruiting women to senior academic positions. One year later, these initiatives have boiled down to a not-so-radical mentoring programme.If these books were familiar, written from a predominantly white, privileged perspective, the next titles were not. Davis begins Women, Race and Class by describing the life of the female slave. Davis notes that, while white women of the abolitionist movement spoke out on behalf of black women, they were unable to grasp the slave woman’s condition, because the black woman, through her experience of hard work, rape, flogging and resistance, had developed traits that set her apart from the white woman. The black woman, like working-class women, worked until they could work no more. They could only dream of the life of the white housewives.One of the problems with the women’s movement, Lorde writes in Sister Outsider, is that “white women focus upon their oppression as women and ignore differences of race, sexual preference, class and age”. As a consequence, “women of colour become ‘other’, the outsider”.As I finished the last book, I was thinking about all the men – and many women – who refuse to call themselves feminists. The writer bell hooks says that whenever she introduces herself as a feminist, people respond that feminists are lesbians who hate men and want to make life miserable for white men. When she then asks them about the feminist books they’ve read, they go silent.We need to “create a mass-based educational movement to teach everyone about feminism”, hooks writes in Feminism Is for Everybody, and I can’t stop thinking that this is what #MeToo is.Sure, #MeToo is many things, and some feminists, including Greer, have openly criticised the movement. It has been suggested that many of the incidents are too minor to warrant serious attention, and that women should be better at saying no and reacting immediately if assaulted.I’m reminded of this when I speak to a female friend, a few days before finishing this article. When she says she is surprised to learn I am “pro-#MeToo”, I find myself responding defensively, assuring her that I do recognise some unfortunate potential side-effects. As if to avoid the broader questions of #MeToo and feminism, we end up discussing the tragic case of a man who killed himself after allegations of sexual abuse that later proved false.A year after the first Weinstein allegations, it could be tempting to look back and focus only on examples of where #MeToo went wrong. But we need to remember why the movement, first started by the civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006, had to take the form it did. It is not as if these stories are new. They just hadn’t been heard properly. And that was one of the most uncomfortable insights from reading these books: that the stories of sexual abuse that emerged last year had been there all along, for centuries. They just hadn’t been discussed, publicly, in the way they have now.A year ago, in the , the writer Emily Reynolds asked what men could do to examine themselves and show solidarity with the movement she advised men to ask women questions and start listening. I’m sure there is much to be learned from going on a man camp and discussing masculinity with other men, but I believe the simple advice from Reynolds is potentially more powerful: ask, read, listen, widen your perspective, call your own perspectives into question.We hold feminism to an unreasonable standard, Gay writes, as though both feminists and feminism must be flawless. She says she is not very well versed in feminist history. She has a wardrobe full of shoes and bags. She listens to sexist rap and reads Vogue. But so what? She is full of contradictions, like everyone else.“I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all,” she writes, and on reading this line, I see an opening, an invitation to me and all the other men who wish to be supportive. I think: if she can be a feminist, then maybe we can, too.Even though, of course, I’m sure I’ll be a much worse feminist than she is.• The Happiness Fantasy by Carl Cederström is published by Wiley.

Six of the men are believed to have died.Ngati Oneone has long opposed having the controversial statue of Cook placed on the sacred mountain of Titirangi, and on Monday the Gisborne district council said it would be moved to the Tairawhiti Museum instead.The council would also consult with the local community regarding the renaming of the Cook Plaza on top of Titirangi, as well as various walking tracks and sites on the mountain.Meredith Akuhata-Brown, a local councillor, told Maori Television the removal of the statue would allow a more nuanced and “honest” story about New Zealand’s history to emerge.Discussions are under way in the Gisborne region for Poverty Bay – so named by Cook in 1769 – to be replaced by its Māori name, or given a dual name.Akuhata described the name of Poverty Bay as “horrendous” and said it was particularly painful as the region had numerous social and economical challenges it was working to overcome."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"DUP leader says it is not a \u0026lsquosacrosanct\u0026rsquo piece of legislation and that \u0026lsquothings evolve\u0026rsquoEU working on minimised checks plan in bid to sell Border guarantee compromise to UKEU negotiators work on softening \u0026lsquobackstop\u0026rsquo plan to give political cover for compromisePoliticians to be targeted over departmental control and perceived humiliation of forcesEmergency meeting of top officers convened as reservists drafted to fill gaps on third shipBen Gilroy also forbidden from acting as legal adviser to othersSurvivors say they were shown file on Bill Kenneally but board failed to notify GardaDonohoe to hold meetings with FF to obtain assent for budget day packageProposed route advanced by planners includes 18km link between east and west of cityMinister expected to rule out granting military personnel the right to strikeThousands of businesses being extorted by paramilitaries, says senior PSNI officerParliamentary Budgetary Office advises broad, non-volatile tax base in budgetJunior Minister Catherine Byrne says lobbying for report ongoing for several monthsAnti-abortion deputy was member of Oireachtas committee on Eighth AmendmentPresidential candidate also defends comparing \u0026lsquoTweetgate\u0026rsquo to institutional abuseTen Protestant workmen killed in south Armagh, allegedly by Provisional IRA\u0026lsquoBabies come hot-wired to breastfeed\u0026rsquo parents hear at \u0026Aacuteras an Uachtar\u0026aacutein eventLocal authorities must once more \u0026lsquotake responsibility\u0026rsquo for building affordable homes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648197.1538425544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crew shortage prevents naval service vessels setting sail","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted recently to supplement crew shortages on the LÉ Eithne, the navy’s flagship. Photograph: APTwo Naval Service vessels were unable to set sail last week because of a crew shortage while reservists have been brought in to plug gaps on a third ship, it has emerged.Emergency talks were held last Friday in Haulbowline between Chief of Staff, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, Assistant Chief of Staff Brig Gen Peter O’Halloran and the Flag Officer Commanding, Cmdr Mick Malone.Meanwhile, the issue of shortages in the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army is expected to feature highly in the annual PDForra conference of non-commissioned officers.The LÉ Orla, a coastal patrol vessel, and the LÉ Niamh, a large offshore patrol vessel, were unable to leave their Haulbowline base, it is understood.Members of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted in recently to supplement crew shortages on a third ship, the LÉ Eithne, a helicopter patrol vessel that is the navy’s flagship.Shortages are such that Naval Service personnel are being asked to return to sea early, sacrificing part of their pre-planned shore leave. This has prompted a level of dissent from some of those asked.Retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne said the relationship between the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence is now “toxic, broken, dysfunctional and dangerous”.Key to the current problems, said the senior ex-officer, who has been critical of military pay levels , is the “long term political and institutional neglect and indifference towards the Defence Forces”.Lieut Col Earnán Naughton, general secretary of Raco, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, said the Defence Forces’ “governance and command structure is breaking down”.“Within the Air Corps, there is a 30 per cent shortfall in pilots and technicians which means the service is operating at less than 70 per cent capacity,” he said. “Army officer corps strength is about 40 per cent down.Senator Gerard Craughwell said Naval Service petty officers and senior non-commissioned officers have been asked to take up lower-ranked duties to make up crew numbers so ships can get to sea.Staffing difficulties are linked to the problem of retaining Defence Force personnel. But strained relations between senior officers and the department run deeper than just this issue.An example cited is how the department treated a joint submission to the Public Service Pay Commission which is looking at pay rates, particularly rank-and-file earnings and restoration of pay cuts.The Defence Forces were asked to tell the department what they wanted, which senior officers did in writing but then heard nothing back until after the submission was forwarded directly to the commission.Last night, the Defence Forces press office said Vice-Admiral Mellett “received briefings regarding naval operations and the challenges associated with the delivery of Maritime Security and Defence services” in Haulbowline.The departmentsaid naval reservists had been given training recently. The service has 92 per cent of its numbers, it added.Recruitment is continuing and staff will get pay rises worth between 6.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent. In addition, they will enjoy the restoration of the 5 per cent allowances cut under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648190.1538425342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces veterans claim lack of respect being shown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRetired Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan and his grand-daughter Aleesha Penrose (9) at an Army protest in September: 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement, a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families, says Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsRetired Defence Force veterans are planning to mount a highly visible public campaign in which politicians will be targeted over what the retirees see as a lack of respect being shown to serving Defence Force members and their families.The perceived lack of respect manifests itself in the relationship between, on one side, the Defence Forces and, on the other, the Government and Department of Defence as well as in the Government’s approach to general pay and conditions within the Defence Forces.According to retired Regimental Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan, a leading member of a close-knit group steering the campaign, 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement – a fact seen as a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families.The Defence Force establishment is supposed to be 9,500 personnel across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. However, at present it stands at some 8,800, many of whom, particularly the rank-and-file members, are struggling financially.Depletions have opened holes in all ranks, including skilled cohorts, such as pilots and aircraft technicians, and further up the command structure, as well as among mechanics and communications officers in the Naval Service, according to sources.The Department of Defence is seen by campaign members as treating the Defence Forces with a degree of contempt. Uniquely in terms of the public sector, the head of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff, is not his own “accounting officer” which means that, even when a budget has been agreed for the Defence Forces, he cannot spend within the agreed parameters without reference back to the department.The actual accounting officer for the Defence Forces, the person with responsibility for recruitment and retention policies, is not the Chief of Staff but the secretary general of the department.The need for departmental approval for almost everything is seen as being insisted upon to an absurd degree.As another of those supporting the campaign, retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne, puts it: “If a local community group came to me to ask could they borrow a tent for a one-day parish event and I had a spare one, I would still have to ask some junior official in the department if it was okay to lend it. Escalate that situation to a critical level of command and control and you can see there’s something wrong.”The campaign aimed at politicians will be rolled out for next May’s local government elections, and also should there be a general election in 2019.Minister of State with responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe (constitutionally, the full minister is Taoiseach Leo Varadkar) got a foretaste of the campaign last Saturday when retired Defence Force personnel paraded outside his constituency office in Wexford.Service defence force personnel are prohibited for strike action, or anything of a similar nature, and also from political involvement. Retired members retain a reluctance to stage political displays, preferring the parade option instead.The campaign will be overseen by five retirees, including Sgt Maj O’Callaghan, and, later this month, they plan to meet and agree the message which they hope local activists in each of the general election constituencies will deliver to candidates.The campaign “will target the message to inidual candidates who are not cognisant of the needs of the Defence Forces”, says Brig Gen Aherne, adding the veterans want “the military family to vote strategically”.Attention is likely to focus on sitting TDs connected to the current Government.“We would encourage veterans to parade in front of every Fine Gael TD’s constituency office, every Independent Alliance TD and the three inidual TDs – Michael Lowry, Sean Canney and Michael Harty – supporting the Government. We are looking for respect and loyalty for the Defence Forces,” says Brig Gen Aherne.He cites several measures needed urgently to address the crisis.There should be a commission to address the relationship between the department and the Defence Forces there should be a reactivation of the Council of Defence, a formal body in which the department and senior officers are supposed to meet but which, according to Brig Gen Aherne “has not met for years because it is a statutory body and the department doesn’t want anything on the record” the implementation of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, and immediate discussions on the implementation of the European Union working time directive.Brig Gen Aherne says also that the operational implications for the Defence Forces in relation to anything that Brexit might throw up have yet to be fully considered.“When the Western Brigade, of which I was the last General Officer Commanding was collapsed – by ministerial order – responsibility for the entire Border was transferred to the brigade headquarters in Rathmines.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648186.1538425071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit full animal checks proposed as part of backstop deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May inspects a family farm in Bangor, Co Down, in March of this year. File photograph: Getty ImagesInspections on live animal imports into Northern Ireland from Britain would have to increase tenfold to full checks under the so-called backstop to avoid a hard Irish border, according to EU sources.EU negotiators are assessing how to “de-dramatise” the proposed legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland, but are working on the premise that checks of animals and animal product imports into the North would have to rise from the current risk-based checks on 10 per cent of imports to 100 per cent under the backstop.The work is being carried out as part of the EU’s attempt to soften the language around the backstop to make it more politically acceptable to the UK in order to reach a deal on the remaining sticking point in Brexit talks.\u0026nbspBrussels is stressing that, in order to protect the single market, the additional checks at Larne, the only Northern Irish port with border inspection posts for live animals, would involve a scaling up of work that is already being carried out there, EU sources say.The European Commission will also propose that a future EU-UK trade deal could reduce checks further, perhaps requiring only a doubling or tripling of current checks.Northern Ireland and the Republic are effectively treated as an all-island unit when it comes to animal health and veterinary checks since the BSE and foot-and-mouth outbreaks.EU-UK negotiations have stalled on the backstop, the insurance policy within the withdrawal agreement covering the UK’s exit from the EU next March that would guarantee to maintain a frictionless Irish border.Dublin and Brussels insist London agree to this last resort option within the withdrawal deal – ahead of negotiations on a trade deal – in case the Border issue is not resolved in a broader EU-UK trade agreement.\u0026nbspThe EU’s proposed backstop involves Northern Ireland effectively staying in the EU customs union and at least part of the single market after Brexit to guarantee there will be no need for checks along the Irish Border.British prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly refused to accept this option, saying that no UK leader could agree to a plan that, she maintains, would split the UK, constitutionally and economically, in two.EU negotiators are formally awaiting Ms May’s own proposal for a legally operable backstop.\u0026nbspBrexit negotiators in Brussels are working on a legal text on the backstop agreement that would only involve minimised technical controls between Northern Ireland and Britain so as not to disrupt trade.The language would be designed to protect the EU single market while avoiding both a hard border on the island of Ireland or extensive checks on a border down the Irish Sea, while making a strong political statement to resolve all issues in a future trade deal without the need to resort to the backstop.Britain’s opposition against two customs areas within the UK remains, however, a major stumbling block and the EU will insist that checks take place somewhere to protect the integrity of the single market.In a further attempt to de-politicise the backstop as a contentious issue, the EU’s text on a legally operable backstop would move checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain from border inspections at ports and airports to spot checks on board vessels and on industrial and manufacturer premises.The EU side has argued that the checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain would be in line with the procedures on imports and exports moving between the Canary Islands and Spain, which does not undermine Madrid’s constitutional integrity over the Spanish archipelago off the coast of Africa.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

As Mrs May celebrated her 62nd birthday, Mr Johnson was pictured jogging through a field near his Oxfordshire home, in a photo apparently designed to mock the PM’s famous memories of “running through wheatfields” as a mischievous schoolgirl.Mrs Foster praised Johnson’s “belief” and “spirit” and said she’d be happy to work with him as prime minister. “People want hope, they want to be positive,” Mrs Foster told the newspaper."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648169.1538423428!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joan freeman a long ago love a loan and the lack of a helicopter","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator Joan Freeman launching her presidential campaign to questions about Des Walsh, the LA businessman who  contributed €120,000 to her cause.    Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIt panned out more like the final scenes of a Barbara Cartland novel than the launch of a presidential campaign. If you read the blurb it goes something like this: A generous loan from a mystery businessman reveals a chance encounter with a long lost love in the shade of a gigantic pyramid.The launch of her official campaign on Monday saw Joan Freeman being bombarded with questions about Des Walsh, the Los Angeles businessman who had contributed €120,000 to her cause by way of a loan.As she recounted at her launch, and earlier to Seán O’Rourke on RTÉ, it had little to do with boring politics, rather a grand romance.For as it happened, she went out with Des Walsh when she was 19 in 1970s Dublin.“So we broke up after less than a year. Des went his way, I went my way. Seemingly what happened was Des moved to America, moved to I think Texas, and then moved to LA.“And after 40 years, he sent me an email. We spoke on the phone.”When asked had she conducted background checks on him, or done due diligence, her response came straight out of the Mills and Boons political playbook.“The fundamental question – sorry I might seem very shallow – what does he look like 40 years later? Is he married? Does he have children? Where does he live?”Despite the persistent efforts of reporters to change the literary genre from romance to hard-boiled, Freeman was not taking the bait.“No I didn’t need to do a background check on him. This guy is a very good guy.”Walsh used to be the president of a huge dietary supplement company called Herbalife which escaped being designated a “pyramid scheme” in 2016 but only after paying a fine of $200 million.In a clear case of rose-tinted ocularitis, Freeman could see no conflict, or no wrong. Walsh had made the contribution in his personal capacity and was now retired from the company. Besides, there had been no “criminal activity” by the company.“Just the way he remembers me from 40 years ago, he believes in what I’m doing. It is a loan,” she said.Freeman has a point in saying that Ireland is becoming like Trump’s America, where only the very rich, or those backed by the resources of a party, can become a candidate for president.She pointed out she will be paying the loan back at 9 per cent interest for five years, or possibly for 10. And she is the only one of the candidates who hasn’t a campaign bus, or, indeed, a campaign helicopter.Freeman arrived to her launch wearing a dress of royal purple with flared sleeves, a colour very reminiscent of Mary McAleese during her campaign in 1997.She outlined a number of interesting initiatives including extending the president’s An Gaisce awards to all age groups, having a national day of wellbeing, clamping down on cyber bullying and valuing our ageing population.The location was the City Assembly House, an eye-catching Georgian building in the city centre. And as is the wont of presidential launches this year, the room always seem too small for the scrum of media and supporters.Freeman talked about the hidden powers and the symbolic powers of the president that can mobilise communities across the country.That said, she is by far the richest when it comes to the timbre of voice and her ability not to get riled by questions. She sounds so like her sister Theresa Lowe, the former RTÉ presenter.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Presidential candidate and Independent Senator Joan Freeman did not donate her Seanad salary to the suicide prevention charity she founded, Pieta House, as she pledged to do.Ms Freeman was appointed to the Seanad in May 2016, as one of then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s 11 nominations to the Upper House. She was nominated by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, under a deal where the opposition leader chose three appointments.Shortly after her nomination, Ms Freeman stated she would donate her €66,277 salary from the role to Pieta House, where she had served as chief executive until the end of 2014.Ms Freeman instead donated €41,000 to Solace House, a separate New York-based charity she set up in 2015.A spokeswoman for Ms Freeman said the donation amounted to her full Seanad salary “after tax and pension deductions, which Ms Freeman was obliged to deduct”.The US charity first started as a pilot in 2015, launched by Pieta House Ireland. Financial statements from Pieta House state the US service would be an “arm\u0027s length domestic not-for-profit corporation” incorporated in New York. The project was initially funded by a €72,258 grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs. *In a May 2016 Facebook post, Pieta House congratulated Ms Freeman on her Seanad appointment, and said it was “proud and supportive of Joan’s decision to give the whole salary that goes with the role of Senator back to our life-saving service”.Commenting at the time on donating her salary Ms Freeman said “I was appointed a Senator because of Pieta House so it’s only right that Pieta House and the community benefit as a result of this”.The charity provides help and support to people suffering from suicide ideation or who self-harm, and organises the annual Darkness into Light fundraising walk.Solace House is a counselling charity set up to offer support services to the Irish diaspora.Ms Freeman has donated her Seanad salary to the American charity from May 2016 to December 2017, a spokeswoman said. The charity was first incorporated as Pieta House Inc as a pilot programme, before it was named Solace House.Separately, Pieta House has warned staff and volunteers to avoid wearing charity branding if canvassing during the presidential election.The charity recently sent an internal note to staff and volunteers warning that their support of any election candidate should not be “associated in any way with the employee’s or volunteer’s work at Pieta House”.The note warned the “employeevolunteer must also not wear clothing or have materials that would lead the public to believe that the person is representing Pieta House”.“Confusion in the minds of the public could pose a risk to the charitable status of Pieta House. The consequences for Pieta House, should it be in breach of charities law, would be extremely serious,” the memo stated.In a statement to The , Ms Freeman said she “absolutely” agreed with the guidelines issued by the charity.“In the early stages of my campaign, I became aware members of the team had contacted Darkness into Light volunteers seeking support for my nomination by using my mobile phone contacts. As soon as I became aware of this I issued an instruction not to do so,” she said.* This article was amended on October 1st, 2018 to provide more detail.

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand AFPGetty ImagesTwo weeks. That is the time the UK has to present its own guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border and prevent negotiations slipping to a crunch EU summit in November and ever closer to a hard Brexit. Just six months before the UK leaves the EU, the notorious “backstop” – the fall-back solution to the post-Brexit border if it is not sorted in a future trade deal – remains no closer since both sides agreed there should be one last year.British prime minister Theresa May agreed in March to include a legal text on an operable backstop – but just not the backstop that the EU has proposed. It would break up her country, she has consistently argued, as it would mean two customs unions within the UK by keeping Northern Ireland under existing EU economic rules.\u0026nbsp EU negotiators are still waiting for May’s own proposal so both sides can start negotiating on a legal text and get down to the business of drafting that has been absent from negotiations for many months. In simple terms, the legally operable backstop – a last resort should all other options fail – is essentially a manual to follow to avoid checkpoints springing up along the new 499km EU-UK frontier from Carlingford to Foyle after the UK departs the EU in March 2019.“This is a legal text it is not a political declaration,” said one EU source. “It cannot be fudged. It has to be legally watertight.”Warnings about the threats to the constitutional integrity of the UK raised the political temperature in the Brexit negotiations and the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has since the summer been trying to “de-dramatise” the backstop in order to resolve the last big remaining issue to agree a withdrawal treaty.\u0026nbsp Should May’s backstop proposal materialise in time and Barnier tells the EU leaders at the European Council summit in Brussels on October 18th that both sides are within touching distance of a deal, then they may agree to\u0026nbsp arrange a special Brexit summit probably during the week beginning November 12th. Finding agreement before then may take the heat out of a November meeting.The border issue rests on the geographical scope of the backstop: whether it extends UK-wide (which London has proposed and Brussels has rejected, and hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party don’t like) or a Northern Ireland-specific solution (which Brussels has proposed and London has rejected). It appears an eitheror choice given the economic and political complexities around this conundrum of whether or not the UK stays in the EU customs union. The UK wants to protect the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU wants to protect the integrity of the EU’s single market.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp The EU would likely agree to the UK staying if it remained fully aligned with EU rules. But since the UK would then have to \u0026nbspapply the external tariff on all non-EU goods, it would \u0026nbspnot be able to \u0026nbspagree trade deals with other countries – a red line for the UK.Last month’s informal EU summit in Salzburg left May desperately clinging onto her “Chequers plan” – which would keep Britain aligned to European standards on goods and food – despite being dismissed by the EU as unworkable and rubbished by the hard Tory Brexiteer rebels ahead of her party conference this week. To create wriggle room, EU negotiators are behind the scenes preparing an “improved” backstop, softening the language to try to take the political heat out of the border issue. They are planning to play down the need for extensive checks between Northern Ireland and Britain that would create a border in the Irish Sea or on the island under its backstop. They may also be willing to agree to a strong political statement saying they believe the backstop will never be used and a commitment to resolve the border issue in a deep trade agreement that will make all trade between the UK and EU as frictionless as possible. Brussels sees this as a way to give May political cover at home. Noises out of London yesterday suggest that May may be working on some kind of hybrid proposal – a UK-wide customs backstop along with Northern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment with the EU on goods that would require some checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.She has yet to formally present her counter-proposal on the backstop – a kind of emergency custody arrangement for Northern Ireland if there is to be a orce before future living arrangements are agreed by the parting couple."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

considers sunday hunting ban teenager mistaken wild boar","story":"Nathan Labolani was walking his dog in the woods near Apricale, 10 miles north of Ventimiglia, on Sunday morning when he was shotItaly’s environment minister has called for a nationwide ban on Sunday hunting after an 18-year-old was fatally shot because he was mistaken for a wild boar.Nathan Labolani was walking his dog in the woods near Apricale, 10 miles north of Ventimiglia, close to the French border, on Sunday morning when he was shot in the abdomen with a 300 Winchester magnum rifle.  The incident sparked a political furore and a fierce reaction from anti-hunting activists, who say that anyone who strolls through the woods is now “gambling with death”. Sergio Costa, the environment minister, appealed to regional governments to immediately ban the hunting of wild boar on Sundays, while pledging to evaluate the need for a national law to “allow greater security and better management of hunting”. “What happened yesterday is a huge tragedy that has struck us all deeply,” Mr Costa wrote on his Facebook page. He said that on Sundays forests and mountains were full of hikers who went in search of mushrooms or chestnuts and they had the right to “simply enjoy nature without running the risk of dying”.Boar populations have risen rapidly in Italy, partly as a result of farmland being abandoned and recolonised by scrub and woodland, prompting a heated debate about how manage their numbers. Authorities estimate there are at least a million wild pigs roaming the countryside and on the periphery of major cities including Rome, up from 600,000 a decade ago.As prosecutors in the town of Imperia opened an investigation into the death, allegedly caused by an unnamed 29-year-old hunter from Ventimiglia, questions were being raised about a 12-gauge shotgun that was found near the victim\u0027s body and whether he was also a hunter.Politicians were ided about the call to restrict hunting, but the Associazione Vittime della Caccia, the hunting victims’ association, condemned Labolani’s killing, saying that anyone who strolled through the woods was now “gambling with death”.“Not only is the one who shot him responsible, but also those who authorise this kind of hunting in public places,” said Maurizio Giulianelli, association vice-president.  The organisation accused government institutions of “hypocrisy and indifference”, saying 217 people had been killed and another 900 injured by hunters in the past 10 years. Of this number it said 31 people were killed during last year’s 2017-2018 season while 17 people were injured in September this year.  “It is unacceptable that we continue to justify the killing and wounding of defenceless people, referring to them only as a ‘tragic fatality’,” Mr Giulianelli said on the association’s website.Former tourism minister, Michela Brambilla, now president of the animal rights group Movimento Animalista, said this was the “umpteenth tragedy” and there was “no place” for hunting on Sundays.“We are asking immediately for more restrictive laws and tighter controls,” Ms Brambilla wrote on the organisation’s Facebook

region of Liguria.But Sergio Berlato, a regional councilor from Veneto the region surrounding Venice, accused animal rights groups of exploiting the accident.“It should be considered for what it is – a tragic accident – and not the demonstration of the need to ban hunting for motives of public order or national security,” he said.Giuseppe Pan, Veneto’s hunting councillor, called for greater education and preparation for hunters. There are more than 40,000 hunters in the Veneto region alone and the regional government has set aside €350,000 (£310,000) in 2018 for education and security

Not small firms…But in the past in my two previous restaurants, when I’d posted about any social impact activities I’ve undertaken – be it hiring ex-offenders or going to west Africa to help girls in a slum dwelling set up their own businesses – I’ve been questioned about my motives in publicising what I’ve done. To some, the post becomes a boast.I’ve carried on regardless, not least because over time I’ve found our customers actually like the fact that we do stuff with the money they spend with us other than just line our pockets. I wish more people would do the same.A new report by campaigning group peak b based on a survey of over a thousand small businesses found that over a third of small businesses said they are not primarily driven by profit, while 90 per cent felt they have a role to play in supporting community organisations.Over three-quarters support local organisations – including charities, schools and foodbanks – despite the everyday challenges that founders face running their own enterprises.\u0026nbspMany of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the ‘purpose with profit’ label – are already purpose driven entities.Day in, day out, small businesses are embedded in communities and neighbourhoods. They are not just a selling device to earn a livelihood for their owners and employees but an empowering vehicle for those who haven’t been so lucky. And they often do this against a backdrop of a struggling economy with increasing costs, rates, rents and competition from larger scale companies.Jenny Costa found herself appalled that food retailers would throw out fruits and vegetables that didn’t look right rather than present them to their customers so she set up Rubies in the Rubble – a business making sauces and chutney from ingredients otherwise destined for the bin.There are even impact investors now – people who will only use their money to back projects that aim from the outset to help solve a social or environmental problem.One of these investment groups,\u0026nbspMustard Seed, backed Jenny and their fund is seeing huge financial as well as social returns.Proportion of small firms who feel they have a role to play in supporting community organisationsAnd that’s the key pivotal point of change we are witnessing in business. Before we would talk of giving something back or of helping others and frankly it wasn’t good enough.Large firms and their CSR pledges rarely amount to more than spending a day in the year painting the proverbial church wall – old style noblesse oblige made contemporary with the aid of a podcast.I’ve watched many social enterprises set out with great missions yet have terrible financial performance. Their losses are often written off by the massive funds that have emerged in the last decade to back projects aimed at tackling problems that charities or governments have failed to.They are now being superseded by the “purpose with profit” business.What the peak b report teaches us, though, is that many of Britain’s small businesses – with or without the label – are already purpose driven entities.As one of its contributors says, we’re often too British to tell others about the impacts we are making as many feel this is a private matter.But when we also read that people do so despite facing financial troubles of their own, we need to spread the message not just that doing good is good for business, but that telling people we are doing good is good for business.Iqbal Wahhab OBE is the founder of London restaurants The Cinnamon Club and Roast and author of Charity Sucks, published by BitebackShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A third and final series was commissioned in August this year. Sir Stelios, who now runs easyGroup, which includes brands such as easyHotel, easyGym and easyPizza, said: “I think this is a case of typically arrogant behaviour by a very large American tech company who never bothered to check what legal rights other companies have outside the US. When Joe Swanberg came up with the name ‘Easy’ for his new TV series a couple of years ago they should have checked with their European lawyers before using it. The man who invented easyJet but couldn’t sell easyPizzaFastjet threatens to sue over Stelios ‘insolvency’ letterSir Stelios will never give his old\u0026nbspcompanies an EasyRide“We own the European trademark for\u0026nbspthe word ‘easy’ and another one thousand trademarks with easy as a prefix and we can’t allow people to use it now as a brand name, especially when they are doing it mostly\u0026nbspwith our colours and font. At least I am pleased that Netflix have said that they will stop at series three anyway. However we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.” A Netflix spokesperson: “We’re looking into it but think viewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly.”Guy Wilmot, a partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, said that for easyGroup to succeed, it would have to establish that using the word “easy” in connection with the Netflix show would lead to a likelihood of confusion with the company’s registered trademarks, or that it would take unfair advantage of the firm’s reputation and brands. EasyGroup could also argue that Netflix is passing off its goodwill in the word “easy”. “EasyGroup does have a significant number of registrations in Europe for trademarks which include the word ‘easy’ and they clearly have a significant reputation for certain services, especially air travel services,” said Mr Wilmot. However, he added that this “does not necessarily mean that it will succeed”. “A trademark registration applies to specified goods and services and goodwill attaches to an existing reputation. If easyGroup’s marks are not registered for TV or entertainment-related services then it might struggle to establish infringement or passing off,” he said.“Even if easyGroup has one or more trade mark registrations which cover entertainment, broadcasting or television services (which given the number of marks it has registered is possible) it can still lose the protection of the trademarks. “There is a ‘use it or lose it’ rule under which easyGroup will lose the coverage of the marks in certain services if the trademark has not been used for those services within the last five years (if the mark is more than five years old).”Mr Wilmot added that easyGroup might need to argue that Netflix is taking “unfair advantage” of its trademarks or passing-off, but said both these claims could be difficult to establish given that easyGroup’s goodwill and reputation is in other areas. “In either case, easyGroup would have to show that there is some connection made between consumers of the Netflix show and easyGroup’s brands,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

A third and final series was commissioned in August this year. Sir Stelios, who now runs easyGroup, which includes brands such as easyHotel, easyGym and easyPizza, said: “I think this is a case of typically arrogant behaviour by a very large American tech company who never bothered to check what legal rights other companies have outside the US. When Joe Swanberg came up with the name ‘Easy’ for his new TV series a couple of years ago they should have checked with their European lawyers before using it. The man who invented easyJet but couldn’t sell easyPizzaFastjet threatens to sue over Stelios ‘insolvency’ letterSir Stelios will never give his old\u0026nbspcompanies an EasyRide“We own the European trademark for\u0026nbspthe word ‘easy’ and another one thousand trademarks with easy as a prefix and we can’t allow people to use it now as a brand name, especially when they are doing it mostly\u0026nbspwith our colours and font. At least I am pleased that Netflix have said that they will stop at series three anyway. However we have to stop them from promoting the older series in Europe for online streaming.” A Netflix spokesperson: “We’re looking into it but think viewers can tell the difference between a show they watch and a plane they fly.”Guy Wilmot, a partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, said that for easyGroup to succeed, it would have to establish that using the word “easy” in connection with the Netflix show would lead to a likelihood of confusion with the company’s registered trademarks, or that it would take unfair advantage of the firm’s reputation and brands. EasyGroup could also argue that Netflix is passing off its goodwill in the word “easy”. “EasyGroup does have a significant number of registrations in Europe for trademarks which include the word ‘easy’ and they clearly have a significant reputation for certain services, especially air travel services,” said Mr Wilmot. However, he added that this “does not necessarily mean that it will succeed”. “A trademark registration applies to specified goods and services and goodwill attaches to an existing reputation.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance – by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.Applications developed through Solid may have a similar function and feel to familiar apps – such as chat apps,\u0026nbspvideo-sharing sites and music players –\u0026nbsphowever there is one key difference: All data that passes through them is under the control of the user.But while the decentralised platform aims to wrest power away from\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspgiants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, the effort will need to be huge to have any kind of impact.Facebook and Google now have direct influence over nearly three quarters of all internet traffic, thanks to the vast amounts of apps and services they own that\u0026nbspincludes YouTube, WhatsApp\u0026nbspand Instagram.\u0026nbspBerners-Lee, waves as he in introduced to the audience during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games (Getty Images)To realise this vision, Berners-Lee has founded a new company called Inrupt, which will provide the necessary infrastructure to support Solid.\u0026nbspHe will also be taking a sabbatical from MIT and his other projects in order to\u0026nbspdedicate his time to Solid and Inrupt.People want to have a web they can trust. People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do – without spying on them, he wrote.Apps that don\u0027t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance... It is going to take a lot of effort to build the new Solid platform and drive broad adoption but I think we have enough energy to take the world to a new tipping point.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible.

London building’s history, rooted in the poverty of the Victorian era, is repeating itselfClick to followThe IndependentThe early residents of Toynbee Hall, with Rev Samuel Barnett sitting to the right of his wife HenriettaIt stands where gastropubs now jostle beside the old East End of Petticoat Lane market, where streets are overshadowed by the gleaming towers of the modern City of London.\u0026nbspAmid such bustle, it is easy to overlook the lower rise, altogether more modest Toynbee Hall, and still easier to miss its significance.\u0026nbspYet this is the place that provided formative experiences for two key architects of the welfare state, William Beveridge and Clement Attlee. \u0026nbspThis is the place that can claim a pivotal role in the creation of social justice initiatives such as\u0026nbspthe Child Poverty Action Group.\u0026nbspIt is where the Poor Man’s Lawyer scheme started in 1898, and where free legal advice is still offered today – along with debt counselling, investigation of social problems and many other community services.More than a century after Toynbee Hall opened in 1884, it remains a place of pilgrimage for researchers and innovators the world over, seeking out the institution where so much began, and where so much is still being done.\u0026nbspAnd now, after a £17m restoration and redevelopment, chief executive Jim Minton is determined the reopening of the Grade II listed building should be marked by an exhibition showcasing Toynbee Hall’s history as a “powerhouse for social change”\u0026nbspand suggesting what it could do in the future.“So much did happen here and so much has been inspired by here,” he says.\u0026nbsp“This is a great moment to open the place back up again, to show the community what they have achieved and to say, ‘Let’s achieve even more in the future’.\u0026nbspBecause the problems have not gone away”20th century (Toynbee Hall Archives)There is, of course, a certain irony in that last point.Toynbee Hall was created to help lift the East End out of poverty but continues to confront\u0026nbspthe same issues of low incomes, high debt and poor housing that affected the area in 1884 – with contemporary twists.Since the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote,\u0026nbspsays Minton, “our free legal advice service has started dealing with questions from people from other parts of Europe who have heard something, or been told something by their employer.”While in the 1880s the head of Toynbee Hall described casual labour – the system that saw men massing outside dockyard gates hoping to be picked for a day’s work – as “the hardest problem of east London”, there seems something of a modern echo when\u0026nbspMinton notes: “Over the past 10\u0026nbspyears, we have seen a significant change towards in-work poverty, among people in insecure employment, or on zero-hours contracts.”And yet, when Toynbee Hall opened in the 1880s, it did so during a decade that was supposed to herald a new and better beginning.\u0026nbsp“It was the end of an epoch,” recalled Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp“The great victories had been won.\u0026nbspSlaves were free.\u0026nbspConscience was free.\u0026nbspTrade was free.\u0026nbspBut hunger and squalor were also free and the people demanded something more than liberty.”Minton\u0026nbspsees parallels today with 1818: low income, high debt, and poor housing\u0026nbsp(Toynbee Hall)In 1883, Reverend Andrew Mearns\u0026nbspwould shock middle-class Victorians with\u0026nbspThe Bitter Cry of Outcast London, his pamphlet exposing the horrors within the “rotting and reeking tenement houses” of London’s “great dark region of poverty, misery and immorality”.In 1888,\u0026nbspJack the Ripper would add fresh horror with his Whitechapel murders, virtually\u0026nbspon Toynbee Hall’s doorstep.\u0026nbspAnd in the\u0026nbspparish of St Jude’s – occupied despite the\u0026nbspbishop’s warning that it was “perhaps the worst district in London” – Reverend Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta were\u0026nbspwell-placed to separate grim reality from lurid sensationalism.The reality was plenty bad enough.\u0026nbspIt featured whole families living in a single room, whole neighbourhoods sharing a single lavatory, with sewers running down the middle of streets.\u0026nbspAnd yet the casual labourer was often paying more in rent per cubic foot than the rich of South Kensington.\u0026nbspThe precariousness of his income meant landlords felt justified in charging higher rents to cover themselves against inability to pay or moonlight flits – an early example, perhaps, of what is now known as the “poverty premium”.In 1883 Rev\u0026nbspBarnett was able to return to his old university to speak at the Oxford Union, and to win by unanimous vote the motion that “the condition of the poor in our large towns is a national disgrace”.\u0026nbspAnd he found a receptive audience when, in November 1883, he came “as a prophet”\u0026nbspto talk to a small group of graduates at St John’s College, Oxford, urging them, as one listener recalled, to “share the life of that dim and strange other world of east London”.For the Barnetts, this “university settlement”, proposed eight months after Karl Marx’s death, would help show the people demanding something more than liberty that they did not need to go as far as revolution.“The poor,” Rev Barnett\u0026nbspwrote in 1895, “think progress is to be won by revolution.”\u0026nbsp But\u0026nbsphe believed\u0026nbspprojects such as\u0026nbspToynbee Hall could help preach “the good news of a unity greater than rich or poor … Humanity will help the poor see the rich as their brothers, and God as their father.”Gustave ​Doré’s\u0026nbspimage of the slums of Victorian London may have been sensationalised for a middle-class audience but the reality was\u0026nbspbad enough (Alamy)Rev Barnett and the\u0026nbspforceful, equally accomplished Henrietta\u0026nbsphoped the young Oxford men would do in the city something akin to what the gentry was supposed to do in the countryside: befriending the poor and showing them how to lead better, fuller lives.\u0026nbspThe Barnetts’ vision, however, also contained large doses of humility.Before devising any bright ideas of their own, the Oxford men were supposed to learn from the poor among whom they were going to live.\u0026nbsp“The needs of east London are often urged,” Rev Barnett told them, “but they are little understood.\u0026nbspHe who has, even for a month, shared the life of the poor can never rest again in his old thoughts.”And so began the building, in the heart of the East End, of something resembling an Oxbridge college.\u0026nbspNamed Toynbee Hall, after the Barnetts’ recently deceased kindred spirit Arnold Toynbee, the Oxford historian credited with coining the term “the Industrial Revolution”,\u0026nbspit opened its doors for the first time in 1884.\u0026nbspRev Barnett was the first warden.\u0026nbspThe volunteer residents\u0026nbspdined in a hall adorned with the crests of their old Oxbridge colleges.\u0026nbspThey were soon offering help, solidarity and a rather mind-boggling array of activities to the East End.In one of the most definitive accounts of the early years of Toynbee Hall, Professor Emily Abel described how East End errand boy Ernest Baker found himself assisting in the running of the Toynbee Hall Elizabethan Literary Society.The Natural History Society broadened East Enders’ horizons by taking them into the countryside, and under the tutelage of some of the more vigorous volunteer residents, the Toynbee Travellers’ Club introduced the London poor to the joys of mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps.As Prof Abel noted, Toynbee Hall’s early residents did not always avoid being clumsily patronising –\u0026nbspone suggested the Shakespeare Club could counteract east Londoners’ “inability to amuse themselves rationally”.Created with

is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalAmong those present was a shabbily dressed character who said his name was Richter.\u0026nbspIn broken English, he berated Morley for supporting the imperialist foreign policy of Britain and other “capitalist nations”.“Go down to Limehouse or Shadwell and see how the people live,” said Richter.\u0026nbsp“Their slums, impoverishment, degradation and prostitution!\u0026nbsp That’s where your foreign policy should lie.\u0026nbspThey are the victims of your capitalist organisation which is just as powerful and cruel as the force of arms.”Morley and others politely begged to differ –\u0026nbspso politely that Richter was invited back to Toynbee Hall for tea a few days later.William Bowman, a Toynbee Hall resident who was present at the tea, recalled how Richter, “who seemed hungry”, tucked into the cakes and was particularly fascinated by the buttered muffins, which he had never tried before.But he wouldn’t budge from his belief in violent revolution.“History has shown,” he told the Toynbee Hall residents between mouthfuls of cake and muffins, “that no great change has been brought about without the shedding of blood and revolution.”Eventually he declared: “I have enjoyed this talk, but now my time is up.\u0026nbspI must go to visit my friends in Limehouse.”Richter\u0026nbspshook hands with the assembled company and departed.\u0026nbspOnly much later did the Toynbee Hall residents realise that they had in fact been having tea with the exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.In a gentler way, some of the stances taken by Toynbee Hall and its residents have been, if not revolutionary, then at least profoundly challenging to conventional wisdom.\u0026nbspEven as the hall opened, the Barnetts were\u0026nbspin the process of parting ways with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), which had started in 1869 as the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity.Much emphasis was placed on repressing mendicity\u0026nbsp– begging.\u0026nbspRather as some now rail against a perceived “benefits culture”, the social reformer Octavia Hill, a driving force in the COS, firmly believed that indiscriminate alms-giving “degraded” the poor, making them happy to rely on charity and unable or unwilling to support themselves through hard work.In a possible echo of the current debates around fit-to-work benefits tests, it was believed that extensive scrutiny of applications for “relief” was needed to distinguish the virtuous but luckless worker from the “clever pauper”.“The main tone of action,” maintained Hill, “must be severe.\u0026nbspThere is much of rebuke and repression needed, although a deep and silent undercurrent of pity may flow beneath.”In the eyes of the Fabian Beatrice Webb, the Barnetts “discovered that there was a deeper evil than unrestrained charity, namely unrestricted and unregulated capitalism and landlordism.”And so in 1888 the matchgirls of the East End found allies in Toynbee Hall when they went on strike, protesting against pitiful wages and factory conditions that included white phosphorous fumes destroying jawbones, giving\u0026nbspmatch-makers “phossy-jaw”.In an early example of Toynbee Hall residents learning from their East End neighbours, a group of them made their own investigations, then helped shape public opinion with letters to The Times detailing the matchgirls’ “deplorable conditions” and below-subsistence wages.\u0026nbspAfter its first warden Samuel Barnett died in 1913, it could be said that Toynbee Hall rose to other challenges.\u0026nbspOn Sunday 4 October\u0026nbsp1936 Oswald Mosley tried to march his uniformed blackshirts through the East End.\u0026nbspJewish groups, trade unionists and leftwingers mobilised to block the fascists’ path with barricades and cries of “They shall not pass!”When the police tried to clear a route for the British Union of Fascists, the “Battle of Cable Street” began.\u0026nbspThe fascists did not pass.\u0026nbspDefeated by the dogged East Enders, police commissioner Sir Philip Game was forced to tell Mosley to march west, out of the area.A week later, however, in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom, about 200 fascists smashed up Jewish shops and houses in the Mile End Road, even throwing a young child and elderly Jewish man through a window.Toynbee Hall warden Jimmy Mallon was appalled.\u0026nbspHe called a meeting at Toynbee Hall that led to the creation of a Council of Citizens of East London, which then issued a notice to be displayed in shops and workplaces.\u0026nbsp“Citizens of East London,” the notice warned.\u0026nbsp “Forces are at work to destroy the common sense and toleration and good humour on which we pride ourselves.\u0026nbspWe must work against these forces.\u0026nbspBoycott provocative demonstrations.\u0026nbspMaintain calm and good temper.\u0026nbspStand together for fair play.”Meanwhile, Jimmy Mallon joined a delegation that persuaded the government of the need for what became the Public Order Act 1936.It banned the wearing of uniforms for political purposes, as well as enhancing police powers to deal with marches.Profumo found redemption at Toynbee Hall, rising from dishwasher to chairman (Toynbee Hall Archives)Such achievements are, perhaps, one answer to the sour aside of East Ender and future Labour leader George Lansbury, who in 1928 wrote that Toynbee Hall was used as a stepping stone by ambitious young careerists who would eventually claim that: “The interests of the poor were best served by leaving east London to stew in its own juice while they became members of parliament, cabinet ministers, civil servants.”Had he lived long enough, Lansbury might have added that Toynbee Hall was also used by at least one ex-cabinet minister to forge a new, post-scandal career.It is often recalled that in 1963, after being caught lying to parliament about his affair with Christine Keeler, John Profumo began a new career washing dishes at Toynbee Hall, rising to become chairman in 1982 and “learning humility” in the process.\u0026nbspBut it is often forgotten how much Profumo achieved at Toynbee Hall.\u0026nbspHe raised funds, helped ease overcrowding through involvement in the Toynbee Housing Association, and backed potentially controversial schemes like the “Grendon outpost”, providing aftercare for former psychiatric-prison inmates.In what could have been another riposte to George Lansbury, William Beveridge freely acknowledged that his coming to Toynbee Hall, aged 24, in 1903 had been the stepping stone to other things.\u0026nbspBut in the same breath, he said that none of his later achievements would have been possible without the “special knowledge … gained in Whitechapel”.During his two years at Toynbee Hall, Beveridge was able, he later recalled, “to learn about the main economic problem of those days, not from books, but by interviewing unemployed applicants for relief”.And Beveridge’s recommendations were implemented by the post-war government of fellow Toynbee alumnus Clement Attlee, who spent a year as the hall’s secretary in 1910.\u0026nbspAttlee came to Toynbee Hall with prior experience of the East End, having been the manager of Stepney Boys’ Club and an assistant to Beatrice Webb.In his 1920 book Social Worker, the Oxford-educated former public schoolboy revealed some of the lessons the East End had taught him.I met a small boy in the street one day.Attlee (first left) at Toynbee Hall in 1910 (Courtesy of Anne, Countess Attlee)Echoing the Barnetts’\u0026nbspgrowing distaste for the COS, while seemingly anticipating some of the thinking behind – and modern arguments about – the welfare state, Attlee inveighed against\u0026nbsp“the suggestion that those in need of relief should be passed through a sort of sieve”“They will spend much time finding ways in which small wages may be made to go a long way, without considering whether those wages should not be raised, or recognising that the claim to a share in the better things of life which is expressed in the purchase of luxuries is a more hopeful thing than submission to low wages.”In the newly restored Toynbee Hall, Jim Minton expresses pride in the connection to men like Attlee and Beveridge. But he is careful to temper such pride with a recognition of the work still to be done.\u0026nbspDespite 134 years of “progress”, despite the wealth represented by those gleaming City of London towers, the East End – still – contains two of the three worst-rated UK parliamentary constituencies for child poverty.\u0026nbspAnd in 2015, the last time such official statistics were compiled, the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham were ranked the worst local authority areas in the country for income-deprivation among older people.Child food poverty ‘sparks return of Victorian scourges’Nearly half of all children in London and Birmingham ‘live in poverty’Government must tackle ‘slum’ conditions faced by private rentersMy forefather’s life in Manchester’s slumsTower Hamlets, Toynbee Hall’s local borough, has about 2,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation and in 2015 just over a quarter of its population was found to be living in income deprivation.“We are talking every day to people who have financial problems,” says\u0026nbspMinton.\u0026nbsp“There are still huge amounts of poverty in east London.“The learning process that Attlee and Beveridge and hundreds of other less famous people would have gone through at Toynbee Hall,” says Minton, “would have been about challenging, and saying: ‘This is unacceptable.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening, and what can we do about it?’”“That,” he declares, “is very much the spirit we want to keep alive.”\u0026nbsp‘Toynbee Hall: A Powerhouse for Social Change’ is open Monday-Friday and on the third weekend of every month at Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London, E1 6LSBattle of Cable StreetShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Heres the lowdown...As of .pm on March  , the UK was set on a course to leave the EU by March , .The PM sent an official letter invoking Article   which was delivered to Donald Tusk.It came after May quashed a Tory revolt after passing a law to authorise Brexit following a marathon five-week battle with Parliament.The Lords had earlier defied the PM by adding two changes to the bill which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens and ensure Parliament has a vote on the final deal - but the Commons threw out these conditions.But it backed down after the Commons vote, agreeing not to tamper with the landmark power - ordered by the Supreme Court - for a second time, ending the constitutional stand-off.On October  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said a pause on leaving the bloc was not on the cards and called on EU chiefs to get real.The Lisbon Treaty came into force on December , , as the culmination of the EUs eight-year quest to make the organisation more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.It set out a number of rules and posts including the introduction of the EU Presidency, redistribution of voting weights of member states and Article .Article  sets out the process of leaving the EU and states: Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.It then goes on to say that a state wishing to withdraw will let the European Council know it intends to leave, which will trigger the article.At this point, the Treaties that bound Britain to EU rules cease to apply and the terms of leaving will begin to be negotiated.The law is not totally clear on this, but there are a few issues that could leave some wiggle room.One primarily beinga transitional deal is not secured with the EU to temporarily cover the countrys EU trade relations while the final deal is being negotiated.If the EU is unwilling to give the UK this deal, it would be an advantage for May to withdraw her request and then trigger it again - buying another two years of negotiations.Justice Secretary Liz Truss has said of Article  that it is her understanding that it is irrevocable.The UK Supreme Court has said once notice, Article , is given it cannot be withdrawn.However, Lord Kerr, author of Article , has said: You can change your mind while the process is going on.And the House of Lords, advised by its legal counsel, was told there is nothing in Article  to prevent a member state from reversing its decision.Former Labour cabinet minister Peter Mandelson has said the deadline will been to be extended.I think everyone knows none of this process is going to be completed by next March, everyone knows it’s going to have to be extended, Lord Mandelson told the BBCs Politics Live.Landmark EU orce talks are now underway, with long-term agreements over issues such as the Irish border still some way off.Former Brexit secretary David Davis and the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier kicked off the Brexit negotiations on Monday, June   with a historic handshake in Brussels.On December , , the EU agreed to move to the second phase of negotiations after reaching preliminary agreements on three of its major priorities the orce bill, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit.An agreement on a transition period, or implementation period, was later reached. Theresa May and her Cabinet pushed for the arrangement to avoid a so-called clf edge moment on March , .However, the agreement of the transition period has not been without dficulties.Fishermen and some MPs were left angry after it was confirmed that the current rules and regulations regarding EU nations access to British fishing waters would remain largely unchanged.After triggering Article  it is supposed to take two years to completely leave the EU but many experts think it could take far more time.Invoking the article fires the starting gun on leaving but there will then follow series of complicated negotiations.The terms of exit have to be agreed between the UK and the  other member states who all have a veto over the conditions of leaving.After that, it will then have to be approved in each of the national parliaments meaning French, Irish or Dutch MPs could, in theory, scupper the process.David Davis announced that Britain will officially leave the EU at pm GMT on March ,  - this date is now exactly six months away.The Article  bill passed through the final House of Commons hurdle in January, when a majority of  MPs out of  voted in favour.More than  Labour MPs voted against the legislation, and just one Conservative - Ken Clarke.This shows the full list of who voted for and against.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He has batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past  months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past  years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number  for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet ”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But eventhey get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for . The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in  or even the Great Exhibition of , which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend  minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And what is amazing to me is how often people try to wriggle out of things and deny a decision they made, in a bid to stay in the process. So when they sit in the boardroom saying, “I didn’t . . . ” we can say, “Oh yes you did . . . ”Some people ask mecertain scenes are staged, but the show is unique in that there are no retakes, there is no setting up of scenes and no trying to find the comedy moment — they just come naturally.All of Alan’s jokes come naturally, too. There is no script, no autocue, it happens as it happens.Luckily, we get on very well — Claude, Alan and I. So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids  years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing  women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as .He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one caresyou have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £ to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PMshe did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for  years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already .% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain  Northern Ireland in .FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If was Mr Hammond’s rival offer to defeat hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Socialist blueprint.Mr Hammond told the conference: “Global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services. The best way to tax international companies is through international agreements.“But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own.”The Chancellor will push ahead with the move after losing patience with the US.Despite repeated promises for global action to end the tax dodge, President Trump’s administration is still stalling on a solution as it reaps billions from the firms, with so many based on the US’s West Coast.Britain is instead now looking at Europe-wide action, as France is also keen for something to be done. The Treasury is also consulting on a second online levy, an Online Sales Tax, to force digital retailers such as Amazon to pay more tax too.But sources close to the Chancellor said he is going cold on that as he fears the giants will just pass it straight on to consumers.The Cabinet has been under heavy pressure to combat Mr Corbyn’s polished offer of Socialist solutions to angry voters’ woes during a successful Labour conference last week.Mr Hammond tackled the Labour boss head-on yesterday, by pledging to “harness the power of the market economy” instead of “a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems”.He insisted Tories must face up to the anger among many British workers, saying: “Too many feel they are working for the system, but the system isn’t working for them.“So our challenge is to ensure st-century capitalism delivers for those people. It will be this technological transformation, and how we manage it — not Brexit — that will define the future of our country and our party.”Mr Hammond added: “Show them that, crucially, the change that technology is driving will address their concerns, not make them worse.“If we look for a moment like the party of “no change”, then we should not be surprised that some will be tempted by the dangerous populism of our opponents.”Mr Hammond also answered the calls of big business who have been stung by PM Theresa May’s attack on excess profits and boardroom culture. Tory donor and City billionaire Michael Spencer said the party had “lost its way” on business, accusing the PM of “letting herself down”.But the Chancellor said: “Let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business. That means we listen to business.” And in a change of tone on Brexit, a more positive Mr Hammond also predicted a “deal idend” that could fund tax cuts and public service spending once a deal is reached.He also said the Treasury was keeping sufficient “fiscal firepower” to hand to deal with any economic fallout from a No-Deal Brexit.BRITAIN still lacks the confidence to intervene in foreign wars due to the disasters of Iraq and Afghanistan, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.LIZ Truss says a German airline turned her into a “radicalised” feminist when she was  years old.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now imagine being in the situation where more people would have turned up to see your speechyou hadn’t turned up yourself. That’s the position Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright was in this afternoon. You see, Jeremy was originally supposed to deliver his speech to Conservative Party Conference as a hologram. A projection. A digital apparition. It was the brainchild of his predecessor, Matt Hancock - now Health Secretary, and much more comfortable in the ‘Minister of Fun’ brief than Wright. You remember him. He’s the one who did Parkour.  And had his own app - called Matt Hancock - which wasn’t very good, but at the very least didn’t leak the Defence Secretary’s mobile number to literally anyone who wanted it. Before Theresa May’s last reshuffle, The Right Honourable Jeremy Wright QC was the attorney general. The government’s top lawyer.I’ve seen Wright deliver learned, competent speeches about tricky subjects like cyber security. He was quite good at it.Which made his move to Culture, where hed have to talk about sportand musiceven more baffling. But while the hologram stunt might have been infinitely better suited to Matt Hancocks talents, at least it would have given Jeremy a bit of pizazz. Wright, a curious charisma vacuum, took to the stage to tell an anecdote about his school play to a concert hall barely busier than the upper room was for the Last Supper. “When I was , I was shy and didnt much like being the centre of attention. I’ve changed,” he joked, fooling nobody. He went on: “But that year I was persuaded to take a large part in a school play. “The effect on my self-confidence, on what I felt I could do, was signicant and long-lasting. “So much so that I feel able to say to you thatI had not stood on that stage then, I would not be standing on this stage now.”  It’s hard to think that when Wright wrote those lines into his speech, he’d imagined delivering them them to a crowd which could have comfortably fit in the school hall which saw his theatrical debut. A conservative estimate - pun intended - put the size of the party faithful somewhere just south of , scattered through the four levels of Birmingham’s cavernous Symphony Hall. I genuinely just went into the hall to see how sparse the crowd was, but so empty was the auditorium I almost felt obliged to keep my seat until the end of his address to make up the numbers. It’s not just him, though he was the most pathetic example. There were plenty of seats free for Chancellor Philip Hammond’s speech.

The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from % to % - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit.  Mr Raab was asked his view on an idea by Chloe Westley, of the right-wing TaxPayers Alliance think tank, of dropping corporation tax to % - and using tax to get a “post-Brexit boom”. The Cabinet minister replied: “You just said Chloe wants to reduce corporation tax to % - and the Chancellors talked about reserving fiscal firepower in the case of no deal. “What more do you want  “Of course hes talking about the recognition that actually, in the no deal scenario, we want to pull every lever weve got to see us through what short term buffeting or disruption we have. “I think the Chancellor gave a brilliant speech and it shows you were all rowing the same boat.”  Mr Raab is a free marketeer who in  proposed scrapping the minimum wage for some under-s. Indicating other Cabinet ministers may back his view, Mr Raab laughed and added: “People were coming to this conference expecting it to be dynamite. “Actually now the journalists are all complaining to me that theres not really much going on, there seems to be far too much of people singing from the same hymn sheet.” “I think the Chancellor gave a great speech, not just talking about what we would do in no deal, but talking about the advantages economically for the countrywe get the Chequers deal across the line.” It comes days after Theresa May pledged to cut Brexit Britains corporation tax rate to the lowest in the G – a title currently held by Singapore on %. Tory governments have already slashed the rate from % in . With weeks left to secure a deal, Mr Raab suggested EU chiefs had “weaponised” the deadlock over the Irish border to get leverage. “I think there has been a bit of that,” he said. “There is no doubt there are some that have enjoyed politicising this issue – I say enjoyed, have taken the opportunity.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what tory brexit going look","story":"NewsopinionThis is what the Tory Brexit is going to look likeTheres bad news for borders, badgers and BorisShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are  days until Brexit, theyve got a full tank of prats, half a pack of loons, theyre doomed and theyre wearing blue rosettes.

To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now,  months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.Patrick Kieltys dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime.

And dont, for heavens sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, youre looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.Youll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we havent dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything  that moved because, after Brexit, theyll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past  years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

Amy goes on to ask: Can you not help me with this last little bit because my little boy is up there crying his eyes out  Can you not hear my little boy crying his eyes out  Can you not even be a decent person, I am heavily pregnant. The driver repeatedly refuses to help Amy with her shopping, before gathering the delivery crates and walking off.  Amy then adds: So youre just going to walk off and leave me with this. In a Facebook post, Amy said: This shouldn’t be happening to anyone, bad health, lonely and elderly, disabled, pregnant!! It should NOT BE HAPPENING. It’s called HOME delivery.

Wojciech Karuzel was driving behind a white Audi on when he thought he noticed the dirty potty being poured out through an open window. Dashcam footage shows what seems to be a green potty being shoved out of the drivers side seat in the back of the car. The person turns it over and the remnants can be seen dripping onto the street below, before the Audi drives off on Newmarket Road in Cambridge.Mr Karuzel told Cambridgeshire Live : We noticed that someone had the potty outside the window and poured it on the street, it was weird and a little bit disgusting. The -year-old noticed a young child moving around in the back of the car before the potty was poured out. He said: The other thing, I quickly noticed the child was jumping around in the car. He added: I think its wrong what they did. On Newmarket Road there are car parks one after another. If the child needs a wee they can pull into a car park and do everything thats needed and then be on their way again, not while moving in traffic. I was quite appalled.Mr Karuzel, who has two children himself, said its something no parent should do because not only is it disgusting but also unsafe. Its so risky, it was unsafe, a child should be in a child car seat no matter what.I could see the child was moving . It didnt look asthe child was strapped in. As a father Mr Karuzel said he understands that parents might have been trying to be consistent with potty training but still thinks chucking a full potty out the window is never ok. I might have understood trying to potty train a child and having that potty with them, but I would never think of it being used while moving. It shouldnt be done. He added: I have two children and I would never consider doing that. I would stop the car where possible and take the child to bushes or somewhere. Its the first time Ive seen anything like that. The child safety is concerning. The child must be in the car seatmoving and eventhe car is in traffic it should never be unbuckled. The incident happened on Wednesday, September  and Mr Karuzel says hes still shocked by what he saw. He said: It did take me by surprise. I did not expect a potty being emptied through the window.

Tanya Cox, , from Hull, has been working in the industry since she was  but says she often thinks about getting a real job. She was scouted as a glamour model while working as a lap dancer and says her past experience enabled her to be comfortable in front of the camera. Despite loving her job, Tanya says she thought about giving up her career when jobs dried up after she turned , reports the Hull Daily Mail. However, shes now finding success again as she breaks into the mature market. How did you get into modelling and was it something you always wanted to do  I never really thought about doing any modelling work but whilst I was working as a lap dancer, I got approached by an agency and was askedI would consider doing any modelling work. I was quite shocked as I thought you had to be tall and skinny to do any kind of modelling but they reassured me that was just the fashion industry and that I was perfect for glamour. How old were you and how long have you been doing it  I came into the industry at  and I’m now . What was it like at first and what kind of things you were doing  Having already worked as a lap dancer for three years, I was very comfortable with modelling straight away. I think its the taking your clothes off bit that worries most new glamour models but as I had already been doing that for three years, that was the easy part, it was learning to find the light and what angles suited me that took the time the learn. Was you aware of any challenges the industry faced at the beginning  No, when I first came into the industry, everything seemed great, people were much more reliable with higher standards always putting quality first back then. But now its more quantity over quality and trying to get as much as possible shot in the time frame are booked for. Was there ever a point where you regretted getting into modelling  When I first turned , my work really quietened off as some companies considered me too old for the young market but I still looked too young to break the mature market. It was a very low point in my le and feeling my career slip away made me so depressed at times that I wished I never started. What has been the best things about it  Are there any moments which stand out where you loved it  I think for me, it helped me to find my own inner strength. I was guilty of never sticking up for myself when I was younger but now Im the first to say when anyone is out of order, whether its towards myself, a friend or even a stranger. Also through modelling and dancing, I have now met the best friends that I have ever had. I trust them completely and never doubt anymore that they all love me, as much as I love them. What has been some of the worst things about it  The worst thing about modelling is the high cancellation rates which has been getting worse and worse each year since , but I dont think that is just an industry problem, I think society in general has forgotten its manners because I have noticed that more and more people cancel social meets with friends than ever before too.  Have you ever been judged based on your career  What do you think of that  Not in my personal le, but since my work started to quieten off and I have been trying to get a normal job, I do feel like employers are discriminating against me as I dont even seem to be able to get an interview these days, and when I was younger I always found it so easy to get work. When a place I worked at closed down, I had a new job within a week. How successful have you been  I felt pretty successful when I was younger but I do think I would of had a better career had I started when I was younger as it only lasted a few years before my peak ran out. I am now just starting to finally break the mature market, so fingers crossed I can make a success of that, but early days yet. Modelling must have changed since you started - have you seen that and in what way  It certainly has, all the technology keeps changing, I dont know how the photographers keep up. And unfortunately the budgets arent as big anymore. I really miss the days of make-up artists and clothing departments on all shoots, but these days its only the very biggest companies that provide those now and for most shoots we just get a list of what types clothing to bring with us and have to do our own hair and make-up. Do you think it will change in the future and in what way  We are seeing dferent types of models coming through now We are and I love that we are now celebrating ersity with models now coming in dferent shapes, sizes, styles and ages. I met a new model on set recently who had just started doing topless modelling at . Social media has also come to the forefront and many models experience trolling - is that something youve experienced  Yes, I have had a few negative comments but, for every bad comment I get, there is always at least  positive comments to counter-act it and the troll then usually ends up getting loads of grief for his her comment anyway so it always back fires on them.  Would you advise someone to get into the industry  What would your advice be and how would they go about getting a break  Although when times are good, its not just a job to me, it is my le and I do love modelling but because of how dficult I have found trying to find a normal job since, no I wouldnt recommend anyone getting into the industry. Butsomeone is  per cent certain that its what they want to do, I recommend joining the online portfolio sites over an agency so you can speak to the photographers you are shooting for direct yourself as the agencies dont always give you the right information. Just make sure you always check references and remember you should never do anything that your not comfortable with. Is age a big thing in modelling and have you ever felt stigmatised by others in the industry  There is definitely more work for younger models, but thanks to films like American Pie making MILFS, GILFS and Cougars sexy, it has opened up the industry to mature models too which is great but the down side is that once your above , everyone feels the need to point out the fact that your older by using the terms MILF Cougar etc alongside all your publications. I am still struggling with this eight years on as I keep getting called a MILF and find the term really offensive. Looking back now, do you feel empowered by it all  I feel that the industry has helped me to realise that it is OK to just be myself and that my imperfections make me human, approachable and more relatable. What agency are you with  Im not with any agencies anymore. They did help get me work when I was new but once you are established, the bookings come to you direct and I also had a problems with been given the wrong information and been sent on jobs for levels I dont cover.

Tony Vaughan was inspired to transform his ft canal boat after a pals suggestion at the pub last September - and four pints of Guinness. Retired engineer Tony, , snapped up the canary yellow vehicle shell for pound and spent six hours a day for a month converting the boat into a vehicle the wheeler dealer himself would be proud of. Tony, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: Making this Only Fools boat has been a laugh for me, Ive absolutely loved it.  I love seeing the smiles on peoples faces when they see my boat come through. If you watch one episode of the show and then watch it a couple weeks after you see something youve missed. So theres always something new to discover - the one liners are so smartly written and I just love it. Trigger is quite amusing because wherever he comes on he says alright Dave  I always laugh at that. The show just makes me laugh. If somebody doesnt laugh at Only Fools and Horses theres something seriously wrong with them.  Dad-of-four Tony bought the boat for pound, eight years ago and has splashed out a further pound, modernising it. Tony said: When I bought the boat it was already called Trotters Independent and we had so many comments when we were in Derbyshire that I decided to keep the boats name. When my mate suggested putting a car on it after Id had four pints of Guinness I thought it wasnt a terrible idea. Two months later Id started looking for a car to put on the back of my boat. Grandad-of-four Tony tracked down a seller from Haywood, Staffordshire, flogging the shell of a yellow Reliant Robin who wanted to keep the engine.  Tony said: I struggled to find a car because some people didnt like what I was going to do with the car. I came across a car for sale where this chap wanted the engine and I just wanted the body, so we came to an arrangement and I ended up with the body of the car. Tony had help at the weekends from boat builder stepson Richard Pemberton, , who joined him for eight hours a day helping to renovate the boat. It involved measuring the boat and assessing which elements of the car would fit. Tony said: All the work was quite technical, which is why I had to get Richard involved as he knows how to build boats. There was a lot of work to do between cutting things, welding and working with fibreglass.  It still had to look like the car, so the bonnet at the front is on the same plane as the back. Its just exactly the way it was when it was a car - just a bit longer and with a boat in between. The most exhausting and dficult thing was to work in between the weather because youre on the canal, so you really feel its effects. He added: The wind and rain can be scary. I nearly fell into the canal a few times barely holding on to parts of the boat, but falling into the canal would have been worth it to get this done. I was determined to get it done and the boat kept getting better and better, so it wasnt dficult to motivate myself to keep working. The more I work on it the more ideas pop into my head as well. Ive just installed a new tiller system, which makes it easier to steer, but I wont be adding any more Only Fools and horses additions. I think its all sorted now.  Tony bought the narrowboat eight years ago and moved into it permanently a year later. His partner of  years, Pamela Allen, , joins him at the weekends but doesnt live on the boat with him. Tony said: I live on the boat and have been living on it for the past seven years. I love it because I get my peace and quiet, and thankfully I never get sea sick. Ive got everything in my boat that youd have in a house. My home essentials include my fire, central heating, cooker oven, microwaves, fridge, and obviously Guinness. I moved into the boat because I got fed up of living in a house. Ive wanted to do this for about  years, and I thought Im not getting any younger andI dont do it now I never will.

After leaving the takeaway Mike was helped by locals who poured buckets of water over him. Mike previously claimed that staff gave two bottles of water to pour over his burning face before being told he would have to pay for a third. He added they were then kicked out of the restaurant forcing him to receive further treatment on the street.  But the owner of Chunky Grill has denied charging Mike for the water. Owner Sayed Hashmi toldthat after handing him a bottle of water free of charge, staff then brought him buckets to pour over himself. Writing on Facebook, he said: “We did give them water and we didn’t turn them away from the restaurant. “In the footage seen in the presence of police shows that Mr Mike has been helped and assisted. “Deeply feel sorry for misunderstanding created that Mike has been charged for a bottle of water.” Mike posted a picture of his bandaged face and thanked people for their quick reactions which he suggested could have stopped scarring from what he initially believed was acid.

Women are  per cent more likely now to cheat on their husbands than in , says best-selling author, Wednesday Martin. She adds that it appears rising numbers of women are prepared to act on their thoughts of other men, despite being in marriages. Wednesday, whose new book Untrue is out this month, came across a number of real women’s voices and stories when carrying out research. In a piece for the Daily Mail , she describes how one woman, called Erica, didnt want to give up on her marriage when the passion disappeared.Instead, after years of sexual disappointment, the -year-old went online to search for someone - and ended up having a passionate affair. Wednesday says the women she encountered had ying problems, from routine sex that didnt fulfil them, to no intimacy, to a craving for novelty. Crucially, none of these women wanted to give up on their marriages or loved their husbands any less, explains the author. While male infidelity used to be at a much higher rate than female infidelity, experts believe the gap is increasingly narrowing. One reason is that more women are out at work, where they are apart from their partners and exposed to potential lovers, some experts say. Another reason could be technology - with women able to discreetly have affairs through social media and apps, according to Wednesday.  And some believe women in long-term relationships are just as likely to lose interest in their other halves over time as men are. Wednesday says that what she has discovered through research is that women’s libidos are far stronger and more adventurous than we thought. Her research included speaking to women of a range of ages, as well as investigating scientic and evolutionary theories. In her Mail article, she says some scientists believe women get bored of sleeping with the same man, and desire others, for evolutionary reasons.

A horrible goal to concede with no communication evident and the defence at sixes and sevens.Soon after the restart the Staggies put the game to bed when Mullin and Mckay linked up again with the former this time tapping in from a yard out on  minutes.Mullin turned provider, once more, two minutes later laying Mckay#s hat-trick on a plate for him and the Northern Irishman gobbled it up from a matter of inches out.Csaba tried to change things for the Tangerines, but by this point the punters had seen enough and were leaving in their droves and calling for his head in the process, as he brought on Stewart Murdoch and Fraser Fyvie to try to change things on  minutes.And three minutes later Murdoch summed up the Terrors afternoon as he was shown a straight red for a stamp on Jamie Lindsay.It capped what was United#s worst performance in years as County saw out the rest of the game with little problem.

the interests of those gathered.It wasn’t so much disagreement or astonishment that filled the room but more a sense of being taken aback by the brutal honesty of a man who has been under such pressure of late.He eased some of the weight on his shoulders with the result at Falkirk under what were strange circumstances – namely going up against predecessor Ray McKinnon in the opposite dugout for a side sitting bottom and pointless.And it was clear that, despite assertions by some that Csaba is daft or clueless, he was very aware of the ramications had he not got the right result.“We showed good team spirit under pressure, they handled it positively,” Csaba commented as he laid out his case to the gathered press.“Now we can close this chapter and look ahead to the next game which will be very dficult.“This is the third season where the fans have been disappointed to be in the second tier and we are talking about a very massive, strong and passionate club that wants to be in Premiership.“If something doesn’t go right immediately you have noise which is OK but we don’t want to hide behind anything.“We have this pressure and we have to accept.“We don’t want to spend one more year in the Championship – it’s not good.“The Dundee United fans don’t want to hear that from the board, the manager or anybody. They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together.

in the month.Douglas Lumsden, co-leader of the local authority, has not been able to give assurances the work – due to be completed in  – will kick off this year, but has said it “hopes” to appoint a contractor by the end of the year.SNP group leader Stephen Flynn has raised concerns over perceived delays to the work.He said: “We’re all well aware that Union Terrace Gardens is behind schedule and

just now and it’s just typical of the opposition trying to talk the city down when they should be getting behind the projects we’re putting in place.”A number of high-profile council projects have been delayed in recent years, including revamps of Broad Street, the art gallery, Provost Skene’s House and the Central Library.London Olympic Park architects LDA Design won planning permission for its Union Terrace Gardens plan in March.The proposals include new walkways, an amphitheatre and a cafe.They aim to conserve the Victorian park’s heritage and to “sustain Aberdeen’s performance in times of economic dficulty”, according to a design statement.Other features of the scheme include a new accessible walkway route into the gardens from Union Street.Lt access from Union Street into the upper level of the gardens will also be provided through a new entrance building on Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument.The central lawn space would be retained as a flexible space for large-scale gatherings and events and there would be a new entrance opposite His Majesty’s Theatre.The plans mark the latest development in the future of the city park.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally ChampionshipPendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August .They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CRMax.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The -year-olds ranked in the top  out of a whopping  youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing andthey liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November  when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of  people and a  of guest judges. And the youngsters only have  seconds left to learn of their -second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.Earlier this year, Ms Howatreshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! AndI want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work. The leaks will carry on leaking and the Ayrshire Post will carry on printing them. It was the Duke of Wellington who famously said “Publish and be Damned”. If you look out your window, Ms Howat, you can see the square they named after him.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilNorth KoreaAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailablethere is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

Similarly, East Ayrshire, which has paid out pound, in settlements since April , and East Renfrewshire, which has paid out pound, in that time, have also failed to rerate the pensions of the affected women.Fe Council, on the other hand, which paid out pound.m in non-pensionable settlements immediately after the legislation was updated, has included pensions in the pound.m it has paid out since. Fe will also factor in pensions as part of settling the , outstanding claims against it.East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Highland, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian have also included pensions in recent settlements and will do so for future ones.The overall result of the dferent approaches is that some women face being discriminated against for the rest of their lives because of the part of the country they lived and worked in, yet no public body will claim responsibility for ensuring the law is enforced.The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, for example, said that while inidual councils are aware of the pension regulations, ldquoit is for each employer to consider the appropriate method of settlement and agree the same with the claimants and their representatives.Audit Scotland, meanwhile, which audits the SPPA, all  local authorities and the  pension funds that make up the Local Government Pension Scheme, admitted that it did not consider pensions as part of its  report Equal Pay in Scottish Councils. It has also not included the pensions issue in any of the reports it has issued following the annual audit of each inidual authority.Noting that there are ldquohighly complex issues around the implementation of equal pay, a spokesman for the body said it is up to local authorities to ldquoagree the pensionable elements with claimants as part of any settlement.Even the SPPA, which forced North Lanarkshire Council to include pensions in its settlements after being asked to intervene in , said it has ldquono powers under pensions legislation to ensure compliance.ldquoCouncils are independent bodies of the Scottish Government so negotiations entered into to settle equal-pay claims are a matter for them, an SPPA spokeswoman said. ldquoIf dferent agreements have been reached itrsquos for the councils to have ensured they are appropriate and compliant.Stefan Cross QC of ActionEquality Scotland, who led the case against North Lanarkshire, said this shows that public bodies are ldquopassing the buck on the issue and failing to uphold the rights of the women the pensions legislation is designed to protect.ldquoThe women are left dangling because none of the authorities will take responsibility for upholding the law, he said.Peter Hunter of the trade union Unison agreed and said that as some women have been receiving the incorrect pension for over a decade, while others have died without ever receiving what they were entitled to, the Scottish Government should intervene.ldquoPay is pensionable and therefore equal-pay settlements are pensionable. All this is crystal clear in the law, rulings and guidance on pensions so non-payment of pension contributions for low-paid women is yet another example,one were needed, of the fact that public bodies need to wake up, he said.ldquoMany councils still donrsquot pay equally, pension fund administrators are inactive in the face of missing millions and auditors still canrsquot grasp the cost and risk of systemic inequality.ldquoThis is a complete system failure. Government has the power to act and the time for action is long overdue.Despite this, a Scottish Government spokesman, who did not answer questions relating specically to pensions, reiterated the SPPArsquos viewpoint that local as opposed to central government should deal with anything related to equal pay.ldquoWe have made clear we believe pay discrimination is unacceptable and that equal pay claims should be settled as quickly as possible, he said.ldquoAs such as we would urge councils, in line with their legal obligations as employers, to resolve any outstanding claims.Equal pay and pensions: The historyTHE Equal Pay Act  made it illegal for employers to offer men and women dferent employment terms, but it wasnrsquot until  that a UK-wide agreement was put in place to ensure all local authorities complied with the legislation.It then took until  for all Scottish councils to implement the so-called single status agreement, with most paying compensation to female workers who had been discriminated against up to that point.Despite this, all councils went on to receive further equal-pay claims in relation to single status itself. The issues raised included the fact that bonuses that only male staff had been entitled to were protected under the new scheme while the job evaluation element of single status deemed some roles done mainly by women to be less valuable than those done mostly by men.In both rounds of claims most councils treated their settlements as compensation, meaning they were neither taxable nor pensionable. In  HMRC ordered that practice to stop, stressing that all equal-pay settlements must be treated as arrears of pay, with tax and pension contributions becoming due as a result. The rules of the Scottish Local Government Pension Scheme were updated to clary the point in the same year.Not all councils complied, however. In North Lanarkshire, affected women took legal action against their local authority in a bid to have their pensions - which are calculated based on salary - increased to the level they would have been at had they not been underpaid.In  the Scottish Governmentrsquos Scottish Public Pensions Agency ordered the council to abide by the law. The effect was to increase the amount the affected women had been paid in the years they were making claims for and, as a result, their pension entitlement too.The SPPA wrote to all public bodies in the wake of the North Lanarkshire case to ldquoclary the policy intent that a payment of arrears of pay, made in respect of an equal-pay claim, should be treated as pensionable.Equal pay and pensions: The impactLIZ Melrose, who is enjoying a late summer holiday in Tenere, is looking forward to retiring at the end of this year after putting in a -year sht at North Lanarkshire Council.Yet while the thought of entering the next phase of her le is an enticing one, Mrs Melrose admits that money will be tight to begin with because she is taking early retirement and so wonrsquot receive the state pension for another two years.Despite this, thanks to a fight put up by her and fellow North Lanarkshire staff, the home support worker will be almost pound, a year better off than she expected to be because the equal-pay settlement she received from the council in  has finally been reflected in her pension.As a result, Mrs Melrosersquos retirement income will rise from pound, to pound, a year when she clocks off for the final time in December. While the numbers are not huge, when her state entitlement is factored in in two yearsrsquo time it will make the dference, Mrs Melrose says, between being able to continue to take holidays in retirement and not.ldquoThat pound, a year is a substantial increase, she says.A retired care home warden is in a similar position. Having stopped work  years ago after  years of service, also with North Lanarkshire Council, the -year old had been receiving the incorrect pension every month in the intervening period until, three months ago, it was bumped up by  per cent.It has, she says, ldquomade quite a big dference to her and her husbandrsquos lives. Her husband agrees, noting that the couple no longer has to be quite so ldquoguarded about what wersquore spending and what wersquore not spending.Yet the outcome is bittersweet, with the womanrsquos husband noting that due to ill health his we is no longer able to fully enjoy the extra money.ldquoThis would have made a big dference to us, a substantial dference, but my wersquos heath has deteriorated and deteriorated and she canrsquot go abroad now because she canrsquot get insurance, he says.ldquoWe both worked all our days and were in the habit of going on a Continental holiday every year until her ill health prevented that. [If the correct pension had been paid from the start] we might have been able to have a winter holiday and a summer holiday.ldquoWhen you get to our age you are on the downward slope as regards time."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-raab-sends-brussels-strongest-signal-yet-uk-prepared-to-walk-from-brexit-talks","story":"The Brexit Secretaryrsquos shot across the EUrsquos bows comes less than a week after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned a no-deal Brexit would be a \"national disaster\".But with less than three weeks to go to the crunch October European Council, Mr Raab will use his keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham to rule out any deal which \"locks in\" Britain to the EU by membership of a customs union or the European Economic Area.He will also reject the European Commissions proposal for a \"backstop\" solution to the Irish border issue under which Northern Ireland would remain part of the EU customs area.The Secretary of State will say: \"We are leaving the European Union in fact not just in name. If we cant obtain a deal that secures that objective... an attempt is made to lock us in via the back door of the EEA and customs union...orthe only offer from the EU threatens the integrity of our Union, then we will be left with no choice but to leave without a deal.\"Restating his backing for Mrs Mays Chequers Plan, Mr Raab will say: \"My approach to Brexit is pragmatic, not dogmatic.

I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.Last night, Mrs May failed to turn up at the Scottish Conservative reception or indeed any other reception in a bid, said party sources, to \"save her voice\" and avoid a repeat of last yearrsquos embarrassing episode when she lost it repeatedly during her end-of-conference speech. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, filled in for the PM at the Scots event.Earlier, the PM unveiled a plan for a Festival of Brexit Britain to celebrate our ldquoprecious Union planned for .And she announced plans to charge foreign home buyers in England up to a three per cent higher rate of stamp duty to stop them driving up prices in the UK with the revenue used use to tackle homelessness.

Cue a couple of decisions from the Court of Session and the current administration has been left staring down the barrel of a multi-million-pound liability that should have been settled years ago.The problem is that the longer the issue has been allowed to fester the bigger that liability has become and the authority appears to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. Though council leader Susan Aitken committed in January to agreeing a settlement this year, so far nothing has been forthcoming, with the womenrsquos legal and trade union representatives accusing the council of burying its head in the sand over even the most basic of issues.Unsurprisingly, the women are irate, and those who are members of the Unison and GMB trade unions are preparing for strike action that could see key cleaning, caring and cooking services in the city grind to a halt in the coming weeks. Yet while their anger is understandable and their cause is deserving of support, the prospect of the strike is worrying precisely because of what it is designed to achieve.All industrial action has an end point in sight, whether it be to increase wages or protect existing rights, and the end point for the Glasgow strikers is to force an immediate settlement of these long-overdue claims. The problem is,Glasgow settles now it is likely to open itself up to further claims of discrimination in the future, with the perfect storm of its discredited pay structure and its obligations under pensions legislation putting any woman approaching retirement at risk.A  update to local government pension rules means that pension contributions must be paid on all equal-pay settlements. Yet because pensions are calculated based on salary, any claimant retiring before Glasgow replaces its pay scheme - something it has committed to do, but which could take years to complete - will have paid extra into the Strathclyde fund without the guarantee of receiving the correct pension in .No wonder Glasgow is baulking at the prospect of brokering a deal. Nor is it the only local authority to freeze in the face of its pension obligations, with the Herald on Sunday revealing at the weekend that councils across the country are playing fast and loose with the pensions legislation, to the degree that some are complying with it while some are merely thinking about it and others are ignoring it altogether.The end result is that women are being discriminated against simply because of the area they chose to live and work in, with an equal-pay cleaner in Dumfries and Galloway getting her pension rerated long before the law was changed to say that was her right while her counterpart in Argyll  Bute has effectively been told to whistle.And so, while some councils grapple with what should be a simple concept, the women who help keep this country going with their daily graft are being left to suffer the consequences. Indeed, while it seems clear that Glasgow City Council has neither the means nor the wherewithal to give its equal-pay women what they deserve, the scatter-gun approach councils in general are taking to observing their pension obligations is creating yet another layer of inequality. The fact that that layer lies between the very women that were discriminated against in the first place is beyond ironic - and beyond unacceptable.Which is why, far from taking their strike to the streets of Glasgow, the cityrsquos workers should be leading women from every part of the country in a march to the gates of Holyrood to demand the Scottish Government intervenes. Councils have had long enough to tinker around the edges of equal pay it is time a higher power took control to ensure unorm justice for all.Such action would likely be a success, too,recent history is anything to go by. Indeed, just last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cut short an official engagement in Germany to come to the aid of the male workers of troubled engineering firm BiFab after they took the fight for their livelihoods to the streets of Edinburgh. The Government handed over a total of pound million and helped broker the buyout of BiFab by Canadian firm JV Driver, even though the dire straits the business had been floundering in meant practically all the workers went on to lose their jobs anyway.Buthundreds of boiler-suited men marching on parliament can prompt such a reaction, just think what thousands of tabard-wearing women could achieve. Who knows, they might even be able to force the Government to sort this whole mess out in time for the th anniversary of the  Equal Pay Act.

They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesnt hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the companys support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March , will feature  of these .MW turbines with a tip height of  metres.Tuesday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amA sheep and beef consultant and qualied vet from New Zealand is to be key speaker at a meeting to be held in Kirkwall this coming Thursday.

This places Orkney third nationwide in terms of the highest empty property rates — behind Shetland and Western Isles specically.Councillor Rob Crichton, chair of the council#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: #Empty homes represent a signicant drain on rural communities, affecting their ability to rejuvenate and grow. They can, however, be utilised to directly counter the issues they once caused.#An empty home brought back into use as a primary residence represents another family in the community, potentially more children in local schools, and more money spent at local businesses.#The document is available at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C empty-homes-strategy-consultation.htm and is under consultation until Wednesday, October , at pm.Any comments should be submitted to Rachael Bowes, Empty Homes Development Officer via email rachael.bowes@orkney.gov.uk.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.#This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said pound, in total would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotTuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar  was incomplete and that some ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar .Mr Black offered an apology for the auditrsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and itrsquos costing us a lot of money. That canrsquot be changed unless wersquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: ldquoThe councilrsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. Itrsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive yearrsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.ldquoPerhaps I shouldnrsquot be surprised. When the council does collect information it regularly ignores it ndash all too evident in the shambles that is their public toilet closure plan.

Essentially, both need to have sustainable ways of making a living to avoid the young people moving away, and ensure that the unique culture survives, Gavin says.ldquoWhat I will be looking at in the talk, as well as giving an insight into le amongst the turquoise lakes and snow-capped peaks, is how Nomadic Skies Expeditions will attempt to test a whole new form of tourism that will benefit these remote cultures.ldquoHow can we prevent the negative and unintended consequences of tourism and make sure the local benefits are maximised  I am sure people will have their own views, from the Scottish perspective and it will be good to hear them.ldquoPeople will also be given the opportunity to be part of the journey with us.The talk will take place in the Gale Centre in Gairloch next Thursday, October  at .pm.For more details about Mr Andersonrsquos tours visit www.nomadicskiesThe  day expeditions start and finish in Kathmandu and typically feature no more than eight to  people, accompanied by Mr Anderson and a local Nepalese guide. The route climbs to as high as , feet, taking in the likes of Ringmo by the famous Phoksundo Lake , as well as the high yak pastures and rock fields above that location.The route is on relatively good paths but with some steep ascents and exposure in places.That, coupled with the high altitude and lower oxygen levels, means that those looking to take part in any of next yearrsquos expeditions should have a good level of health and fitness and experience of walking.Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Recent figures showed the fund increased in value in - by pound. million.

They took the time to chat to us and were very encouraging.\"Jacqueline Farrell, education director at The Princersquos Foundation at Dumfries House, said: \"In the British textiles industry, there is currently a huge demand for skilled employees. The courses run by The Princersquos Foundation at The LVMH Textile Training Centre exist not only to equip trainees like Mairi with the practical skills they need but also to connect them with industry professionals.\"As part of the course, the Mairi undertook a work placement with designer Christopher Raeburn in London and everyone was very impressed with her talent and work ethic.\"Tuesday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Ms McMillan said she believed she had no other means of getting the vaccine and criticised a “failure” to communicate the fact it can be obtained privately via pharmacies. The -year-old, who has pulmonary hypertension and uses oxygen, said fears for her health over the winter prompted her to drive to Berwick-on-Tweed where she paid for the enhanced vaccine at a Lloyds pharmacy.She said publicity for the seasonal flu vaccination programme made no mention of the fact under-s could pay for the aTIV jab in Scotland. Ms McMillan said: “When I found out the enhanced vaccine is only available to people aged  and over in Scotland, I was appalled. I was furious that people who have problems with their immune system aren’t having their health taken into account. “The only consideration is a date on a calendar. That is not how you should run a health service.“When I travelled down to England on Sunday and stayed overnight, I did so because I thought that was the only way to get the jab and to try and prevent problems with my respiratory system. I certainly wouldn’t have paid those hotel and diesel costsI didn’t have to, but the message that is being given out to the public is that you have to be  or above in Scotland.”A spokesman for the Scottish Government confirmed that provided they met the clinical need, Scots under the age of  could purchase the aTIV privately.However, posters and literature produced by NHS Education Scotland and Health Protection Scotland make no mention of the fact.Aileen Bryson, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society’s interim director for Scotland, said: “In theory,a pharmacy has stock of the vaccine and the patient meets what’s known as the patient group directioncriteria, they could provide it on a private service.“Each service has its own criteria. Some might be working to the  age limit, others to the  age limit. But the services are trained to work within those criteria.”Public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick told Holyrood last week NHS National Service Scotland ordered its vaccine before expert advisers recommended changing to a new strain, meaning under-s would not be eligible for aTIV on the NHS. The government spokesman added: “In line with expert clinical advice, the aTIV vaccine will be offered to people aged  and over this winter, as they have been identied of gaining the most benefit from the new vaccine.“It will be rolled out to all those aged  and over from next winter. “It is important to stress that the flu vaccine offered to those aged  to  this winter still provides flu protection.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802756.1537444466!/image/image.jpg","title":"iconic edinburgh detective rebus makes his theatre debut","story":"Ian Rankin#s most famous character takes centre stage tonight in Birmingham in a play adapted by Rona Munro. Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808155.1538422212!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey do you have a secret urge to control women in your life metoo","story":"Last week, globally renowned trauma psychologist and addiction specialist Gabor Mate, in response to a tweet regarding the #metoo movement, wrote: #If we look within deeply, honestly, and without succumbing to defensive avoidance, most men # myself for sure # will find lurking in ourselves anti-female anger and an urge to control women.# He added: “It’s part of the culture we’ve absorbed it isn’t always personal. But the reflection must be.” His call for men to look inward, at a time when it is so easy to measure our attitudes and behaviours against the most egregious examples of male entitlement and misogyny was timely,not unwelcome in some quarters of the male community. Personally speaking, his words brought a sense of relief as I have been thinking along the same lines for quite some time.To this day, as I continue to try and mop up the mess of what feels like a former le, I am confronted by aspects of my past behaviour for which I must account in some way, either privately or publicly. Dficult conversations that simultaneously fill me with optimism and make my skin crawl. Some concern my attitudes and behaviour in the context of relationships with women. Are there any men out there who, like me, oscillate from feelings of hope, relief and gratitude to feelings of shame, fear and anxiety when male behaviours are dissected, re-contextualised and then remarked upon by thousands of people  Anyone  running a fine-tooth comb through their own sexual history, in a state of panic, using contradictory social media hot-takes as a reference point for what you’re looking for and only ending up even more confused Given the levels of obfuscation and hostility whenever the issue is discussed, it is no wonder so many women feel anxious about speaking about their experiences. And even less surprising that so few men are willing to be more open about aspects of their own behaviour that may fall within the purview of the #metoo moment. To truly consider this issue as deeply as we are being asked to as men, we must become willing to confront the possibility that we have caused a woman to feel pressured, frightened or even harmed. That while our behaviour may not meet the current criteria in mainstream media – which usually involves a wealthy or powerful man’s serially violent, predatory behaviour towards women – we should not therefore assume we have not been guilty of these things, albeit to lesser degrees, in the past. We live in a time when things we never thought twice about could potentially be deemed unacceptable or even criminal. A time when sex education for most young people is violent pornography, in which many of the female performers are, themselves, victims of sexual abuse. How does a man become willing to consider that he may, in some way, have been complicit in this endemic inequality, as bystander or perpetrator  I do not write this for woke-points. I am trapped in a place many men currently find themselves between the rock of becoming a better man with a measure of maturity and self-improvement and the hard place of knowing past attitudes and behaviours were unacceptable. For a man of my type, this is an uncertain time, though not as uncertain or frightening as it clearly is for women. #metoo has likely triggered y periods of reflection for some men, though there seems nowhere to go to get insight into what emerges from it means. Or what to do,anything.While I do think it’s wholly appropriate than men feel a twinge of discomfort, even excruciation, at times, as we reckon with ourselves honestly, this cannot be a final destination. Fear and shame, while certainly useful in short sharp doses, do not create conditions for growth and change, in the long run. It is important to note that the culture of shame and condemnation we are currently experiencing has nothing to do with women speaking openly about their experiences of harassment or abuse. It’s a direct result of how men are responding, which often creates an accuser denier dynamic that curdles any attempt to understand the truth or reflect honestly. We must draw a road map for men who are willing to face themselves honestly and even take responsibility, wherever appropriate. We must model to those men what that looks like while remaining keenly attuned to what women are asking of us.What strikes me about the high profile cases that have come to characterise the #metoo movement, is that a certain type of man is not only unwilling to even consider the possibility that he is even capable of causing harm, but will do everything in his power, aided by a culture weighted in his favour, to reduce the women speaking out to no more than witches in a hunt. Not all men are like that. Not all men would respond in that manner. Not all men prefer the comfort of self-delusion to facing truth. But there remains great confusion about what a man should do, both to very whether he has caused harm in the past and what would be an appropriate course of action going forward. This is not about creating safe spaces or self-help groups for unrepentant, violent, predatory harassers, sex offenders and abusers but about making it safe for men, raised in a culture of entitlement, exploitation, violence and pornication, to learn more about how such a culture has impacted them and whether this had implications for women in their lives. It is right that men, using their power and privilege to actively evade justice, be shamed and condemned. But going forward, we will require a few more tools in the armoury as more men, unable to bury their heads in the sand, are faced with a choice: reject #metoo for a temporary feeling of relief from scrutiny or embrace it fully and accept that doing so means more than simply speaking in platitudes. It means staring into the pit of your own soul, fearlessly, willing to confront whatever you find there. How do we create a parallel conversation where men can authentically reflect on what #metoo means to them  And how do we do this while acknowledging at all times that #metoo absolutely had to happen. Thatnot for this outpouring, as messy as these things can be on social media, then we would not have this opportunity to reckon with the truth of ourselves.

The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.“VA Dundee is not an outstation of the VA in London. As one of the founding partners, VA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the VA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the VA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in , suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last  years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.Geordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the  game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinleyI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead EnnisThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday th, September. Thousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.Sinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. “Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. “The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these

this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046476.jpg--.jpg?1537863861000\n","title":"par ful good effort for dementia charity","story":"Ballymena Golf Club did par-ful well by raising pound,. at a Charity Golf Day event for Dementia NI.The even saw approximately  golfers in  teams take to the greens on a superb sunny day .

Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches. We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it. It took them a day and half to put it on site but they been working at it before that, preparing the windows and things like that.   Minister of Rathfriland Presbyterian Church Rev Trevor Boyd “You’ve got people involved in the painting, there’s farmers involved with their telehandlers, supplying the straw and putting it into place.“It’s a relevant way to connect with people, to get their interest and to highlight to them that it’s harvest time and that there’s an opportunity to thank God for the harvest in First Rathfriland.”Of the structure, which is located around half a mile from the church, Rev Boyd said: “There’s been quite a draw to it, as in other years. People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

The installation of new seating, lighting and landscaping along the route will help make the trail accessible to all.It has been a goal for many years to connect all council owned open space along the river and this latest set of works is the final piece of the jigsaw which has been made possible thanks to £, funding secured from SOARVillage Renewal Measure.During the course of the works some disruption to the area may be necessary including the temporary closure of the footbridge at Gilford Community Centre and certain access points to the park.

Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.For years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorleyhas buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.McSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.As the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.Funeral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.A special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.Basil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfastand News Letter for some Protestant customers.A hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.The undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.Irena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.After a high profile republican and loyalistare killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet  I will say no more.Three’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.The play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.Spike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.Three’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.The play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Armypage on Facebook, gaining , followers in no time.As for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights I can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.Three’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October . Tickets are available by calling   , online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"THE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted  responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.Mr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September  and working to seeinstitutions for dealing with the past up and running.Campaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over  responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when  victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” "},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Hes always tinkered and restored cars and I wanted to help him. I guess this was my apprenticeship,\" said the -year-old nurse from Middletown.Mandy and her dad spent weekend after weekend lovingly restoring the car over the past four years.\"We just started it as a weekend project.

However, looking at it now, theres no way Id ever part with it. It has a lot of sentimental value.\"The Cortina caused quite a stir as Mandy, husband Justin Gormley, Robert and mum Jessica made their way through the Continent on the ,-mile road trip. The family spent a lot of their spare time posing for photographs. The Cortina was even commandeered for a photoshoot by a model agency in Paris.\"The whole experience made us feel pretty cool,\" added Mandy.\"Once the Cortina got through the MoT in June we decided wed go for it. We turned it into our family holiday, though we had to load the boot up with a lot of spare parts just in case, as we werent really sureour work on the car would last the pace.\"We thought about driving straight to Cortina and back again, but it was too good an opportunity to waste, so we planned the trip to take in a lot of the sights all of us wanted to see around Europe. It all went so well and we might plan another one.\"Apart from the UK, the car passed through the Republic, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy, Austria, Slovenia and Monaco.\"Weve been through the Black Forest, driven across the Millau Viaduct in southern France, the highest bridge in the world, and around the famous Stelvio Pass in the north of Italy with its  hairpin bends,\" said Mandy.\"When we arrived in Cortina DAmpezzo in Italy the locals were amazed to see the car. \"There are not that many of them still around, and even fewer managed to make it back to the town they were named after.\"Back in  a new Ford Cortina would have completed around  miles to the gallon, but Mandy said she wanted to make the car as economical as possible.\"You could say I had a trip like this in the back of my mind when we put a diesel engine in it, and in the end we were getting up to mpg, so that was well worth it considering how far weve managed to travel in it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast international airport apology after chaotic delays at security checks","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning. Customer services staff were on hand to deal with any passenger queries and  indeed any passengers with feedback or complaints we would ask them to contact the airport directly so that we may resolve their issues.\"Dont forget to arrive at least  hours before your flight and that carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security.

We again urge passengers to arrive at the airport at least two hours before their flight is due to depart, evenyou are travelling with hand luggage only, and to be prepared for the security search.\"Long queues at security were reported over the summer causing much frustration. And last Monday the airport blamed equipment failure for long delays though its security.Michael Smyth - a union official for Nautlilus International which represents ferry workers - arrived early at the airport for his flight to Liverpool for his organisations annual conference.He is a regular flyer visiting many of the UKs ious ports. He said he queued for an hour on Monday and while he made his flight with time to spare he said others turned back in the queue saying they had missed theirs.\"The queue was all the way down the escalator,\" he said.\"I just couldnt understand it as all the lines were open and they were processing everyone at a fair rate. It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then.

Arron said that the hedge sits lower than the road, so they couldnt be seen.He believes it is there that the pregnant animal was hung up on barbed wire to be skinned and had its legs cut off in the barbaric attack.\"You can see the clean lines of the kne, and the wool and the skin was cut off - not pulled off,\" he said last night.Arron explained he had been trying to build up his flock, but now another of his sheep has lambed early because of what he believes is trauma.The lorry driver said he was keeping the horric story from his two young children - a son and daughter aged seven and six respectively - as it was too disturbing.He described those behind the grim attack as \"total scum to do this to an innocent animal\", which he believed would have suffered.\"How anyone could do this to an animal is beyond me,\" he said. \"Someone knew what they were doing.\"This wasnt a five minute job.\"It wasnt a pretty sight to come across this morning,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"do you know who owns this locket woman looks to reunite jewellery found in dublin charity shop dress with owner","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The documentary includes an interview with Ms Hambleton who has been fighting for justice for more than four decades.\"What do I want  Me, personally, I want the b******s who killed my sister and the other  to be brought to justice, short and simple,\" she said.\"We could have walked past him when we were in Belfast.\"When people ask you howd you feelyou met them or saw them, you can never answer that question.\"As a teenager in  Reilly, who had been living in Birmingham at the time of the massacre, was interviewed by West Midlands Police but denied any involvement.However, he did admit to bombing a number of local businesses in the city and was sentenced to  years in prison for conspiracy and causing explosions, and moved to Northern Ireland following his release.The investigation relied heavily on the work of former Government minister Chris Mullin, who campaigned for the release of six men who were wrongly convicted for the bombing in .Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker became known as the Birmingham Six and eventually had their le sentences quashed by the Court of Appeal in  in what was one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in English legal history.On two occasions Mullin interviewed a man who admitted to the bombing on the condition that his identity would never be revealed.But by cross-referencing information in Mullins book with police transcripts and birth records, interviewing eyewitnesses and a former IRA man, Mr Ware is convinced the evidence points to Reilly and Gavin.Reacting to the new documentary, Ms Hambleton, who is a spokesperson for the Justicethe campaign, said all the relatives of the  victims welcome the revelation which has offered them hope of finally getting justice.\"We all remain puzzled over coroner Sir Thorntons reluctance to address the perpetrator issue which they believe is a vital piece of the jigsaw,\" she said.\"This is the same coroner who has previously called on perpetrators to enter the witness stand which then led to prosecutions.\"The tireless campaigner has spent the last two days protesting with other relatives outside the International Conference Centre in Birmingham which is hosting the Conservative Party Conference.\"We are fighting the biggest juggernaut in our country which is the British Government which for some reason is protecting those who murdered our loved ones,\" she said.\"Successive governments in the UK and Ireland have allowed mass murderers to walk free without fear of retribution which makes a mockery of even having a criminal justice system.\"Whats the pointno one is prepared to put people through the prosecution process \"Last night Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed he will be requesting a meeting with Sajid Javid to discuss a number of issues relating to the inquest in light of the new allegations.\"I have listened to Ms Hambleton and will be requesting a meeting with the Home Secretary to allow her and other relatives to present their case,\" he said.Ms Hambleton, who confronted a number of prominent MPs and Government ministers yesterday - including Nicky Morgan, Justine Greening, Anna Soubry and David Davis - praised Sir Jeffrey for vowing to help.\"Nearly  years later we are still fighting for our relatives who dont have a voice, but nobody in the British establishment or Irish Government wants to hear us,\" she said.\"They wish they could bury us alongside those who died because we dared to raise our heads above the parapet and ask questions and demand serious answers.\"But we are encouraged that some politicians, including Jeffrey Donaldson, are listening to us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to reveal new brexit plan for border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

It was never going to happen this side of conference but will hopefully happen shortly afterwards,\" a source said.Irish officials are keen to see the proposal which is understood to have been completed some time ago by the UK.Just over a week ago, Mrs May said the EU \"did not respect\" that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK after Brexit after it rejected her Chequers plan.She reiterated there would never be a border in the Irish Sea.Mr Swann said he welcomed the Prime Ministers \"strong words\" in support of keeping the UK together.\"My message for Michel Barnier and the rest of the EU negotiators, including the Republic of Ireland government, is that Northern Ireland and its position as an integral part of the United Kingdom will not be a sacricial lamb in the Brexit negotiations,\" he said.\"We are approaching crunch time in the negotiations and EU negotiators should not attempt to continue the folly of using Brexit in a foolhardy attempt to break up the United Kingdom. Their words have repercussions and demonstrate an ignorance of the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent.\"At the conference, Brexit Minister Dominic Raab warned that the UK Government will not accept two dferent customs regimes in the UK.Mr Raab said the EU needs to show less dry legalism in talks on Northern Ireland.\"Frankly, I think its outrageous even to contemplate it,\" Mr Raab added.Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party is holding an event at the Tory conference to ensure that \"the needs of Northern Ireland are properly understood\".She added: \"Our event marks the fact that we work together for the entire United Kingdom as unionists.

Welcome back, basketball. pic UiXEHRl— Blake MurphySeptember , Remarkably all those symbols on that page do indeed tell the story of the match, in a form of shorthand Blake developed three seasons ago when he became a freelance reporter. “One of the areas of my work and knowledge I wanted to sharpen up was recognising specic plays and doing some video work,” Blake told the Press Association. “So initially, this was just so I could note when certain play types happened and at what time so that I could go back and cut the clips more easily afterwards.“But then I found I really enjoyed keeping kind of a live diary of the action like that. I find it helps me stay focused on the game.”The reaction on Twitter from Blake’s fellow writers ranged from admiration to concern. Omfg Blake wtf is that  You can go back to that a day later and make sense of it  You can both watch the action and write all that  I am. im. pressed.— Justin BourneSeptember , blake are you okay— martin rickmanSeptember , This gives me anxiety— Mike ZavagnoSeptember , So, how does Blake’s shorthand work “The actual shorthand is pretty simple,” he said. “Player initials for players, X or check for miss or make, time and score updates. “The ones that confused people are probably play-call notes like ‘dk’ for a drive and kick or ‘Pr’ for a pick-and-roll, or situation notes like ‘ato’ or after a time-out or ‘slob’ for a sideline out of bounds.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “There are some other ones too – who is defending whom, what lineup is out, etc – but mostly it’s just the players involved in the action and what the action was.”Some on Twitter pointed out that there might be easier ways for Blake to take notes of the action as it happens, but he prefers his way.They have these things called computers these days that let you take notes and format things in such a way that they’re legible.— Jeff SiegelSeptember , I like this way.— Blake MurphySeptember , Blake added that the notes help him when it comes to re-watching match footage, by allowing him to quickly find the plays that were of interest in the game.All in all though, it’s about preference. “I fully realise it looks silly and it’s entirely unnecessary to take detailed hand notes in ,” said Blake. “It’s just a comfort thing that I’ve grown to like doing while I watch.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage taken from the centre of tropical storm rosa in arizona","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Midfielder Eoin Lundy took the gamersquos first score before Ciaran Sloan levelled matters with a converted free.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.The challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.A Force  gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some  minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.On arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasnrsquot.The leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.As the leboat made herjourney to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.Theto Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at pm, ing home one hour later.ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.Some of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekendrsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellanrsquos Lower Square for generations.Slieve Croob councillor Roiacutesiacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the townrsquos permanent Christmas tree.ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8745091.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

DUP leader Arlene Foster wants more Catholics to join the PSNI but opposes : recruitment. Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin refused to rule out ato the Patten-era recruitment technique, but DUP leader Arlene Foster MLA instead called for an examination of the issues of why Catholics are not seeking to join the police. “I’m all up for that discussion as a political leader but discrimination in the form of : recruitment is not the answer,” she said. “It causes more problems than it cures. “People should be appointed on merit, not on the basis of what church they attend or their religious affiliation. I do want to see more Catholic officers join the force especially in communities such as where I live the police service should be reflective of the community it serves.” ACC Martin called for nationalist community leaders to help. “I would encourage people with influence within the Catholic community to encourage and advocate for people in this community to step forward and apply to join the PSNI,” he said.However the largest nationalist party - Sinn Fein - came under fire once again yesterday for refusing to call on Catholics to join up.Former Police Federation chairman Jimmy Spratt slammed Sinn Fein for failing to make a direct appeal to its voters. “Sinn Fein only paid lip service to this during my time on the Policing Board,” he said.Sinn Féin Policing Spokesperson Gerry Kelly MLA said Mr Spratt “completely misses the point” - that   recruitment was necessary to address decades of imbalance.However Mr Kelly still maintained it was the responsibility of the PSNI to proactively “encourage young Catholics to join the service” and that “no political party recruits for the PSNI”.UUP policing spokesman Alan Chambers MLA said his party supports measures to recruit more Catholics but opposes :.ACC Martin said it was imperative that nationalist leaders back call for people to join up.“If that doesn’t happen and our Catholic success rate were to continue as in the last few campaigns, it’d be inevitable that in future years you might start to see the Catholic composition of the organisation fall.“That would be unacceptable and I think in those circumstances all options would need to be considered,” he said.The   mechanism was established to rebalance a force largely comprised of members of one side of the community.Nationalist politicians viewed it as a success, but unionists said it unfairly discriminated against Protestants.Mr Martin noted it delivered an increase in Catholic representation from % to %.A report by consultants Deloitte – Understanding Barriers Affecting Police Officer Recruitment – into more recent issues found that the opinion of family and friends sometimes deterred members of the Catholic community from joining.The report also said many Catholic applicants dropped out of the recruitment process ahead of the initial selection test because they were hiding their application and did not want to attend an exam centre.Steps to address that include taking the test online.With the dissident republican threat continuing, Mr Martin said the ability of Catholic officers to travel comfortably into all communities is playing a part in their decision-making.Mr Martin said bringing back   was a political decision.“I don’t think we should be dismissing any optionwe started to see the Catholic composition rate continue to stall or indeed fall,” he said.The latest recruitment drive is seeking  new officers to replace those who are leaving, to keep the force at around ,.That will represent, by next March, a reduction of  officers.Mr Martin said: “We are reducing because of affordability, not because of operationally thinking it is prudent or appropriate.”Former Policing Board vice chair Denis Bradley said last year that Catholic PSNI officers are mainly still unable to live in nationalist areas of NI.try catch     .               ..

Irsquom not going to beat around the bush, itrsquos hell on earth.ldquoThe voice in my head has been so unbearably loud I havenrsquot been able to cope with it and when I go to the doctors Irsquom told that Irsquoll be at the top of the waiting list soon.

I donrsquot want to be so depressed I canrsquot get out of bed and I donrsquot want to feel suicidal and like my le isnrsquot worth living because of my mental health problems.ldquoSo obviously my way of combatting this is jumping out of an aeroplane.An estimated . million people in the UK suffer from an eating disorder, serious mental illnesses that include binge eating disorder, anorexia, bulimia and other types.Beatrsquos Community Fundraising Officer Andrea Auburn said, ldquoGrace is making a huge step in raising awareness and money to help ensure that eating disorder sufferers get support.ldquoGrace is joining dozens of other brave volunteers who are skying to beat eating disorders.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

PSNI Craigavon PSNI said: “The car was safely stopped and both front tyres were shredding off the rims. Clear signs of being driven straight into the likes of a roundabout or similar. “The male driver was invited to step out of the car but in all the excitement he must have ‘forgotten’ that his trouser belt and fly were both undone.“Neither the male driver or his female passenger were able to explain this dress code but needless to say, gravity stepped in and left the male staggering about trying to recall his trousers from around his ankles.“Fast forward a few hours and the male was charged for failing to provide the required samples of breath for analysis. The partial sample that was provided indicated that he was at least twice the legal limit.”The officer posting said colleagues would ‘just have to suck it up that he doesn’t know exactly how the two front tyres came to be hanging off the rims. Was it due to the excess alcohol alone or was the driver otherwise distracted “Who knows!“On a dferent side of this story, we also ensured the driver’s intoxicated we was conveyed safely home. “We are not in the habit of abandoning intoxicated females on dark country roads. “The driver was also taken to hospital by ourselves due to showing medical signs that were not consistent with simple intoxication.“Luckily on this occasion there were no deaths or injuries and a few lighter moments to reflect on.”try catch     .               ..

However in business, things are really moving and the way we do business is evolving at a breath-taking pace.The biggest change we’re seeing is in all things digital. We now adopt new technology quickly and easily because developers are getting better at using a human-first approach to make complex things intuitive. Take contactless payments.Remember how the first few times you waved your debit card at a machine, it was a bit scary and surreal. We’ve rapidly become accustomed to contactless payments and things like Apple Pay. This once futuristic stuff is now common place and it is really transforming how companies transact.Along with these complex advances come the obvious threats of cyber security, the potentially ransomable value of inidual or company data post-GDPR, and the competitive market risks to businesses which aren’t already on their digital game.While we’re seeing a burgeoning community of tech start-ups through both our own Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and a growing number of incubator hubs in Belfast and Derry, as well as impressive numbers of IT jobs created from inward investment, it’s never too late to begin your digital transformation. The thing is,you’re a tech firm, your financial tech needs to be walking the walk too. Increasingly, we’re finding clients placing more emphasis on this in their choice of banking partner, above all .Barclays was the first bank to develop an ATM over  years ago, and the first UK bank to launch a credit card. In more recent years we were among the first to launch contactless cards, and we were the first bank in Northern Ireland to make cheque imaging available to our clients. In the past  years we’ve invested over £bn in new technology which has meant our clients can be sure our digital technology is right up to date. While other banks are now facing a catch-up period of investment and the challenges of upgrading their s, Barclays has the technology already in place. Our personal banking app was recently voted best in the UK, and our small business  allows businesses to access a pre-approved overdraft limit at the touch of a button.  Our award-winning corporate cash management system, Barclays.net, is tried and tested by the % of UK companies which put it through its paces every day.BEYOND NI: EXPORTS AND CONNECTIONS The spotlight is being turned on Northern Ireland’s exporting capabilities, brought into sharper focus by the issue of Brexit. Without doubt, export sales are one of the key opportunities for growing the economy. We are really excited to work with established export businesses like Moy Park at one end of the spectrum and a successful new tech business, Neurovalens, at the other. This start-up began le as one of the first tenants in the Barclays Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and due to growth, has recently moved into its own premises to accommodate its now more than  staff.While access to money is obviously important for business growth, access to our networks can be just as valuable for NI companies. With Barclays’ major presence in the UK and US, our London and New York private equity contacts are opening doors for Northern Ireland firms looking for market intelligence.This style of partnership working with a local banking team, which can link into a well-established international network, is exactly the foot up our companies need to make them competitive in a global economy.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"justin rush taking pride in recruitment","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Anyone that attended the  Belfast Pride Festival would have been bowled over by the number of participants in the parade, the huge crowds of well-wishers who assembled, and the sizeable number and range of employers supporting the event. It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice. If you feel your organisation would benefit from being more visible and more inclusive, visit www.stonewall.org.uk ersity-champions-programme Justin Rush is director at Belfast-based Abacus Group.

A planning application, made by PWD Developments, is seeking to create a mixed use development, which will incorporate two ground floor units and eight apartments.The proposed scheme would involve the demolition of the two-storey building to make way for the new three-storey project.The building sits across the The Pavilion and Errigle bars, was put on the market last year with a price tag of around £,.The proposed building design has been developed to improve the streetscape, and according to the architects, offers a clean, crisp and modern interpretation of a traditional design.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Foyle.jpg","title":"foyle port posts record turnover of m","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Foyle Port has posted record turnover of £.m while pre-tax profits now sit at £.m.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards.
