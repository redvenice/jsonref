One views it as a supreme exercise in composition, like an abstract painting: the photograph is ided into three vertical sections – road, buildings and rooftop – each delineated by contrasts in sunlight and shadow. The image is a photographic equivalent of the modernist architecture it celebrates, dwelling on concrete geometries.In the other way of seeing, the eye fixes on the four figures on the roof. The cityscape below and its teeming traffic becomes a vertiginous backdrop to their curious, elongated silhouettes. The four are cast in an apparently conspiratorial drama that demands to be understood. What is their purpose up there? Why are three of the figures in step behind the man ahead? The shot looks like a still from a film – but the tone is elusive.Speaking about the photograph – a highlight of a forthcoming Magnum print sale – not long before he died in 2014, Burri described how it came about. “Did I know those men were there when I took that photograph? No. Buildings weren’t guarded in those days. It was a question of getting to the top and knocking on the door… ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come in!’ So I walked out on to the terrace and, at that moment, those guys came from nowhere and I shot five images.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/049cbbfe9f84db138f67084660900492971532f4/80_13_1716_1030/master/1716..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b94e7a7514800b5b81361402c767c4f","title":"behind the iron curtain the final frontier soviet space art in pictures","story":"With more than 250 artworks sourced from cold war-era Russian magazines, Alexandra Sankova’s book Soviet Space Graphics: Cosmic Visions from the USSR (Phaidon £24.95), produced with the Moscow Design Museum, explores “the dream of conquering space”.One of the most vibrant publications was Tekhnika Molodezhi (Technology for the Youth) its “unearthly palettes of pink-violet and ochre-scarlet colours”, says Sankova, pulling readers into stories of “inventions and innovations, the mysterious and unknown”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1677cd65157509df2b9df479976e4f1adfa3135b/0_105_3200_1921/master/3200..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e217983d1834e86d0b8f68c1d379f58","title":"bondi beach how the australian icon became a coronavirus hotspot","story":"Bondi is one of NSW’s most famous destinations, drawing 2.6 million visitors a year. Has its popularity made it vulnerable to Covid-19?A block from Bondi Beach six female travellers, all aged between 22 and 31, share a two-bedroom flat, each paying $200 a week in rent.They came to Australia, and settled in Bondi, for the work opportunities, the sun and the freedom.Last week, two of the women tested positive for Covid-19.The Sydney beach suburb draws 2.6 million visitors each year, according to Destination New South Wales. It’s a place of contrasts. Sparkling natural bounty and dense urban living. Billionaires and backpackers. Instagrammed bodies and old-timers’ swimming clubs. A place obsessed with health and beauty but now, one of Australia’s Covid-19 hotspots.Bondi, part of Waverley council area, has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus, the local council’s 159 cases as of Friday (101 of them in Bondi alone) knocking the sunshine out of the surfside playground.This week, in response to Waverley’s newfound status as home to both the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the highest number of locally transmitted cases in the state, the government opened a local pop-up testing clinic. While the advice during the global coronavirus pandemic is to stay home, the reality for some, especially in a place like Bondi, is that crowded living conditions make physical distancing difficult, even for the most prudent.“I couldn’t believe I was negative, I slept in the same room as two positive girls,” says one of the Argentinian housemates who was given the all-clear, who did not want to be named. “I was staying home, worrying about the virus outside, but it was in my own place.”Unsure where to turn, she appealed to the authorities for help and her infected housemates – one of whom is suspected to have caught the virus in the house – were moved into quarantine in hotels, paid for by the government.For the others, a sense of gratitude has settled on the flat: they and their sick housemates are safe and isolated, friends are helping with food deliveries and a neighbour has lent them exercise equipment. She has heard of worse, including newly jobless, homeless travellers who cannot get to their home countries, and infected members of shared houses who have stayed put.They’re like many temporary working visa holders who continue to share cramped homes, some of 12 to 15 people, across the suburb. Since 20 March, hostels, meanwhile, have had to comply with new distancing rules of one person every 4 sq metres. At Noah’s Backpackers, just along from James Packer’s erstwhile beach house, every room, including six-bed dormitories, were made single occupancy.The landmark building has a view down on to the Bondi Beach that is usually alive with crowded surf and its famous lifeguards. On 21 March, the beach was closed, its entrances hastily fenced off. With no surfers and sunbathers, Bondi Beach has never looked so bare. Now in the spotlight as the centre of Australia’s coronavirus outbreak, the suburb has never felt quite so exposed.The scene is a far cry from images just over two weeks ago, when crowds from well beyond Sydney’s east took to the sand on a 36C day, flouting social distancing rules and the new 500-person limit on outdoor gatherings. A hot Friday with family-friendly surf is what Bondi does best – but by the next afternoon and in the glare of global media, police were sweeping the beach of sunbathers, forbidding even surfers to enter the water. For the first time, the beach known around the world as an icon of Australia’s natural beauty and symbol of our love of the sea and sun is now associated with something far less glamorous. When New South Wales chief health Officer Dr Kerry Chant singled out backpackers and their potential to infect the community when outlining the response, she directed public focus towards Bondi’s reputation as a destination for travellers, already in the headlines because of a coronavirus cluster traced to a tropical-themed party at a popular Bondi beachfront bar.From Noah’s Backpackers, the view is bleak. A few weeks ago, the hostel was bustling with 266 guests. Now, it’s desolate, with manager Dylan Tenbrink closing its doors last Wednesday, saying it was “impossible” to stay open under the new regulations around social distancing as well as media scrutiny. Unfounded rumours of a positive case of the virus in the hostel were unfairly targeting backpackers and the result was fear among both visitors and the community, he says.With a young, international demographic and thousands of daily visitors, Bondi’s infection rate comes as little surprise to local photographer and Aquabumps gallery owner, Eugene Tan. He has photographed Bondi Beach at daybreak for the last 21 years, and the daily surf photos are known worldwide.“Bondi’s a brand, everybody knows it. You come to Sydney, you come to Bondi. It’s a welcoming place,” he says. It’s that spirit that might have landed Bondi in the situation it’s in today.“The police cleared the beach on Saturday and then all the bars filled up. It’s a melting pot, which I love, but Bondi gets out of hand easily – we have a lot of travellers and they have a carefree attitude.”But to point to the backpacker community alone as responsible for local infection rates is to miss the reality of Bondi’s broader community.The suburb has long been home to professionals and young families from all over the world and less than half of its population is born in Australia, with many residents from Europe, South Africa, America and Brazil. At a local childcare centre where a parent tested positive for the virus, children speak Italian, French, German, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Italian. Long-haul travel, responsible for bringing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections into Australia but also for connecting expats with their families, is as much a way of life as the beach.The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, says it is the kindness of the community and its adaptability that stands it in good stead for the future. “We are all in this together.” Brand Bondi, after all, reaches well beyond its bay and, to Tan, its pull is stronger than ever. He has been receiving messages from people all over the world telling him how images of Bondi are keeping them sane during lockdown.“Without the beach,” he says, “you feel a bit lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b354bcca1c72adf2f40a6a7488afd02c39e524f7/0_196_3000_1797/master/3000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23b8ea610049977a954258fb0ff2b8c4","title":"keir starmer won the party handsomely now he must start convincing the nation","story":"Labour’s new leader will need to show that he has the capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of votersTalking about Keir Starmer, one Labour MP recently asked a colleague: “Is he another Ed Miliband?” The question was the more pointed because the person posing it was none other than Ed Miliband himself, the ex-leader responsible for one of the quadruple election defeats suffered by Labour in the last decade.Miliband Mark II, a closet Blairite and a 21st-century version of Harold Wilson: a variety of labels have been applied to Mr Starmer. He has become irritated by it, protesting that “I don’t need someone else’s name tattooed to my head”. Yet he has invited these speculative attempts to define him by spending the long months of the leadership campaign deliberately eluding a precise ideological identity.That was based on the calculation that keeping it vague was the way to maximise his support. The cautiously calibrated route that he chose to take to the Labour leadership largely eschewed taking any positions that would ide party opinion. This pleased activists who wanted to draw a line under the bitter factionalism of the Corbyn years. His victory statement on Saturday morning, echoing the relentless mantra of his campaign speeches, again called for unity.Unity around what? He says he wants Labour to be both “radical” and “relevant”. Who among them is going to say that they want to be “reactionary” and “irrelevant”? He has spoken warmly about the legacy of the Corbyn years, while also saying that the party should rehabilitate the New Labour era. “Don’t trash the last Labour government and don’t trash the last four years.” He has suggested that the last manifesto was “overloaded” with too many promises, while at the same time issuing “10 pledges” that committed himself to a lot of Corbynite policy. The reward for this face-all-ways approach was to be swept into the leadership with a majority of first preference votes in every section of the electoral college and a very wide spectrum of support. He had the backing of people intimately associated with New Labour as well as those who were fervent admirers of Mr Corbyn. The downside of such a sprawling coalition is that this leaves a lot of potential scope for disappointment.The leftwingers who supported Mr Starmer are generally assuming he will put a more credible face on a Corbynite programme. They will be expecting him to stay faithful to its central tenets and are likely to react with angry cries of betrayal if he doesn’t. He also attracted a lot of backing from the centre-left, including New Labour luminaries such as Charlie Falconer and Andrew Adonis. Mr Starmer took their support for granted during the contest, while he concentrated on wooing the left with activist-soothing pieties about the superiority of socialist values. The Labour centrists are assuming that he will reorient the party towards what they would call more sensible positions. “He’s got two very different kinds of supporters,” notes one very senior Labour figure. “They can’t both be right about him.”He starts with some clear advantages. One is that it will be hard to be worse than Jeremy Corbyn, author of such a dreadful defeat that Labour’s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level since 1935. Mr Starmer can harvest some early credits by restoring professionalism to Labour as an opposition. Labour MPs expect, and Tories agree, that he will do a much better job of holding the government to account. As the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, he comes to the task of leadership with senior experience of running a complex organisation. It can be an advantage that he came into the Commons just five years ago. Having become an MP later in life than most, he is not encumbered by an accumulation of historical obligations and debts to colleagues. “Keir is a loner really, not at all clubbable. He is one of the least cronyistic people I know,” comments a fellow Labour lawyer. That ought to leave him free to make frontbench appointments based on merit. The shadow cabinet will be recast to remove Corbyn-loyalist duds and make better use of the talent pool on the Labour benches that has been under used in recent years. He will have a fight, which he must win, to remove the Corbyn acolytes at party headquarters. A leader is never properly in charge of a party unless he can count on the loyalty of the general secretary and other key officials.An early test of his mettle will be how he tackles antisemitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is due to report on whether Labour became an institutionally racist party during its calamitous experiment with Corbynism. A damning report will suit Mr Starmer if he uses it to make good on the promise in his victory statement to “tear out this poison by its roots”. He has indicated that he would support the automatic expulsion of any member found guilty of antisemitism, a position that will meet resistance among those on the left who will condemn it as a purge. Taking a robust, no-tolerance approach to antisemitism would allow the new leader to demonstrate to the public that Labour is now under a very different kind of management.Ah, yes, the electorate. Remember them, Labour? The party has been talking to itself rather than the country during the many months of a leadership contest so interminable that Britain was still a member of the EU when nominations opened. Yet voters will ultimately be the arbiters of whether Mr Starmer can put his party on the road to recovery or merely adds his name to the lengthening roster of failed Labour leaders.He won the leadership in part on the grounds of “electability”, which is a way of saying that he meets conventional expectations of what a potential prime minister ought to look and sound like. “Keir passes the ‘shut your eyes’ test,” says one supporter. “You can shut your eyes and imagine him standing outside Number 10.”That is a necessary quality in someone who aspires to be prime minister, but it is not an entirely sufficient one. Successful political leaders also require a capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of voters. Tony Blair and David Cameron are the last two leaders to take their respective parties from opposition into power. Both had a talent for persuading the public that they had changed their parties for the better. Both combined that skill with an ability to convince the country that they had a plausible plan for national renewal.In this critical respect, Mr Starmer has yet to prove himself. The words most often used when admirers describe him are decent, pleasant, diligent, forensic, moral, sensible, clever, collaborative and credible. You never hear him called exciting, captivating, entertaining, rousing, surprising or inspirational. He has yet to mint a cut-through zinger such as “tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime”. There’s no memorable phrase associated with his name.Some of his allies think an unflamboyant style will commend him to voters as they grow tired of what a Starmer-supporting Labour MP calls “Boris Johnson’s histrionic blustering”. Other Labour parliamentarians, and this includes some who are broadly hopeful about his leadership, reckon this is complacent. One former member of the shadow cabinet recently remarked to me: “I worry that Keir and his team are underestimating just how difficult it can be to get yourself a hearing as the opposition.”That challenge will be even tougher for as long as the coronavirus crisis is so all-consuming that it eats the rest of the news. A first test of his leadership will be how he calibrates scrutiny of ministerial handling of the pandemic. He said yesterday that he would “engage constructively with the government” and not score “party political points” or make “impossible demands”. This reflects an instinct to try to be statesmanlike. He will have a fine line to walk. Be overly cautious about calling out ministerial blundering and he will be accused of being too soft. Be too aggressive and he will be charged with stoking panic and fear.His longer-term prospects will be shaped by what sort of country emerges from this crisis. The victory speech - “we can see a better future” - hoped for a post-coronavirus Britain that has a more collectivist spirit that places greater value on public services and their key workers. The optimists in Camp Starmer believe that the emergency will leave the public dissatisfied with the vaudeville style of performative politics personified by the current prime minister and ready to rediscover an appetite for more sober-sided politicians. There is one thing that no one says about Keir Starmer. He is never called frivolous. That will do him a power of good if Britain decides that serious times call for serious people.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94da8b7fa75460912f7770ad2b30c72a2d090661/0_64_5184_3110/master/5184..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c523260f8b638a761fd119a404952f3","title":"whether in the uk or the developing world were not all in coronavirus together","story":"In the slums of Delhi or Lagos, social distancing is a dream while social exclusion is all too real and pernicious‘The virus does not discriminate,” suggested Michael Gove after both Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, were struck down by Covid-19. But societies do. And in so doing, they ensure that the devastation wreaked by the virus is not equally shared.We can see this in the way that the low paid both disproportionately have to continue to work and are more likely to be laid off in the sacking of an Amazon worker for leading a protest against unsafe conditions in the rich having access to coronavirus tests denied to even most NHS workers.But to see most clearly how societies allow the virus to discriminate, look not at London or Rome or New York but at Delhi and Johannesburg and Lagos. Here, “social distancing” means something very different than it does to Europeans or Americans. It is less about the physical space between people than the social space between the rich and poor that means only the privileged can maintain any kind of social isolation.In the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, somewhere between 180,000 and 750,000 people live in an estimated 20,000 shacks. Through it runs South Africa’s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has tested positive for cholera and has run black from sewage. Makoko is often called Lagos’s “floating slum” because a third of the shacks are built on stilts over a fetid lagoon. No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word’s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are squashed into less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean? Extended families often live in one- or two-room shacks. The houses may be scrubbed and well kept but many don’t have lavatories, electricity or running water. Communal latrines and water points are often shared by thousands. Diseases from diarrhoea to typhoid stalked such neighbourhoods well before coronavirus.South Africa, Nigeria and India have all imposed lockdowns. Alexandra and Dharavi have both reported their first cases of coronavirus. But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. Four out of five Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India’s working population, are migrants from elsewhere in the country. Yet their needs had barely figured in the thinking of policymakers, who seemed shocked by the actions of the workers.India’s great exodus shows that “migration” is not, as we imagine in the west, merely external migration, but internal migration, too. Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason – they are not seen as “one of us” and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, were sprayed by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.All this should make us think harder about what we mean by “community”. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine. When Donald Trump reportedly offers billions of dollars to a German company to create a vaccine to be used exclusively for Americans, when Germany blocks the export of medical equipment to Italy, when Britain, unlike Portugal, refuses to extend to asylum seekers the right to access benefits and healthcare during the coronavirus crisis, each does so in the name of protecting a particular community or nation.The rhetoric of community and nation can become a means not just to discount those deemed not to belong but also to obscure isions within. In India, Narendra Modi’s BJP government constantly plays to nationalist themes, eulogising Mother India, or Bhārat Mata. But it’s a nationalism that excludes many groups, from Muslims to the poor. In Dharavi and Alexandra and Makoko, and many similar places, it will not simply be coronavirus but also the willingness of the rich, both in poor countries and in wealthier nations, to ignore gross inequalities that will kill.In Britain in recent weeks, there has been a welcome, belated recognition of the importance of low-paid workers. Yet in the decade before that, their needs were sacrificed to the demands of austerity, under the mantra of “we’re all in it together”. We need to beware of the same happening after the pandemic, too, of the rhetoric of community and nation being deployed to protect the interests of privileged groups. We need to beware, too, that in a world that many insist will be more nationalist, and less global, we don’t simply ignore what exists in places such as Alexandra and Makoko and Dharavi.“We’re all at risk from the virus,” observed Gove. That’s true. It is also true that societies, both nationally and globally, are structured in ways that ensure that some face far more risk than others – and not just from coronavirus.

After his YouTube videos went viral, he gave up his day job to pursue a full-time career in comedy. He now co-writes and stars in his own sitcom, Man Like Mobeen, the third series of which has just arrived on BBC One (Mondays at 10.45pm).How are you coping with coronavirus shutdown?Still alive innit, so that’s a positive. You’ve got to take the positives where you can because it’s a mad mess out there. We’re being good and following government guidelines. Everyone has to take this seriously. Don’t go out, people. Stay in the house and shag instead.Just before the lockdown, you did standup in the US for the first time. How did it go?A bit weird. When the MC introduced me and I walked onstage, a couple of guys in the front row immediately tutted, folded their arms and started frowning. I took that as a challenge. That’s the beauty of standup. Within 10 minutes you can go from “I can’t believe they gave this Muslim a microphone” to “I love this dude, he’s hilarious”.How would you describe Man Like Mobeen to newcomers?In some ways it’s a traditional sitcom in the vein of Only Fools and Horses, but we felt the show was in a unique position to make you think as well as laugh. We discuss issues like racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, police prejudice…Art Malik plays a crime boss in the new series. How was working with him?He’s a legend. Looking at casting tapes, we were like: “If we don’t get Art Malik, the show is ruined.” When he arrived on set, we tried to be clever and discuss how he perceived the role. He turned around and said: “Guys, just tell me what the fuck to say and I’ll say it.”You’ve been called “the new face of British Muslims”. Is that a pressure?It’s impossible to always say the right thing and please everyone. I felt one responsibility and that was to Small Heath in Birmingham – an area often maligned in the local media. I wanted people here to feel proud and identify with the characters. The overwhelming majority were happy, so I am too.Do you get criticism from the Muslim community too?Of course. Usually about swearing. Somebody messaged me on Instagram asking why I’d said “shit”, so I clicked on their profile and there was a clip of Nicki Minaj twerking! The Muslim community is a complicated set of people. All I can do is try to speak the truth.You’re also up against Ross Kemp, RuPaul and David Attenborough…Imagine that party! Let’s set it up as soon as quarantine ends.You launched a scheme for local youngsters to get paid experience on your production team. Why?Our crew are incredible and I love them to bits but they’re overwhelmingly white dudes. I can talk the talk but unless I facilitate it, I’m a paigon, as Stormzy says. We do a good job of representation on-screen but wanted to get working-class kids behind the camera too. A few comedians are former teachers – like Romesh Ranganathan and Dawn French. What makes it good preparation for standup?Broadly there are two types of teachers. Ones who are all about the curriculum and imparting knowledge, then ones who understand that we have human beings sat in front of us who are going through all kinds of shit every day, so let’s chat to them and entertain them. The second type are the ones who become comics. There’s no better training in crowd-work and navigating emotions. That tough gig in America was nothing compared with a year 9 girls’ health and social care lesson. Those girls were danger.Do your former pupils come to gigs and watch you on TV?They do, which is a lot of fun, but they’ve grown up so quick. One girl came to see me recently and her boyfriend looked about 40. I felt like calling the police! Who were your comedy heroes growing up?Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle. From the UK, Lee Evans and Peter Kay. Chris Morris is so unique too. But none of them compares with my old dear, who lives next door to me now. Pound-for-pound, she’s the funniest person you could hope to meet. I said the other day, “Mum, we should do a show together” and she was like “Do I look like Romesh’s mum, mate?” There’s no messing with her.The BBC comes in for a lot of criticism. What do you think of it?It’s such a broad-ranging organisation. It’s a fragmented eco-system, staffed by people with completely contradictory opinions. These are confusing times, but without the BBC it would be a lot worse.What’s next for you?I’m trying to write a sitcom about my teaching days.

His latest offering is more like a dream – or rather a conjunction of dreams, occupying that liminal space between waking and sleep (“half one thing, half the other”) where the land meets the sea, past meets present, and lo-fi home-made cinema brushes against something sublime. As with so many of Kötting’s films, the central conceit involves a journey – a quest apparently undertaken to restore the titular artefact to the place of its making in the Outer Hebrides, and thereby cure an amorphous “unwellness”. I have no idea how much of what is documented here is “true” suffice to say that it all feels profoundly truthful.We’re told that the whalebone box was made over 30 years ago (“it belonged to another time, another place”) by sculptor Steve Dilworth, who fashioned it from the skeleton of a whale that washed up on the Isle of Harris. Tied with the twine from a herring net, lined with the lead of melted weights, and filled with “calm water”, the box came into the possession of Iain Sinclair, the author and “psychogeographer” (“a walker and talker”), who has become a regular Kötting collaborator. Sinclair called the box his “animal battery”, and for years it sat by his desk while he wrote. But at some point he decided that it should be returned to its home and buried in the sand where the whale was beached. And so, aided by pinhole photographer Anonymous Bosch, Sinclair and Kötting embarked upon a “reversed pilgrimage” to do just that.Part of The Whalebone Box is a typically fragmented account of that journey, venturing in a chronological fashion from the psychic aerial of Sway Tower in the New Forest to the standing stones of Lewis (via ersions through the Pyrenees), all recorded in a variety of DIY formats, both physical and digital, and interspersed with archive footage, still photography and animation. The other part is a journey into the dreams of Eden Kötting, the remarkable artist who has long been the muse and inspiration of her father, Andrew. In these sections we find Eden seated like a regal seer in a forest, a gun across her lap, holding a pair of binoculars to search for whales. In her dreams, Eden has fashioned an imitation of the whalebone box, a papery contraption that lacks the physical heft of its namesake. Yet somehow, this dream-box has found its way into the “real” world. Or maybe it’s the other way round?Borrowing intertitles from Leviathan by Philip Hoare (the author who also informs and structures this odyssey), The Whalebone Box muses on familiar themes of folklore, history, mysticism and “happenstance”, as it meanders across disparate landscapes, several journeys becoming one. En route we encounter the graves of Basil Bunting (“Poet of Northern England”) and Sorley MacLean (“Poet of Northern Scotland”), and hear the poet-artist MacGillivray perform her spine-tingling murdered mermaid song in a church, sounding for all the world like a whale out of water, crying plaintively into the abyss. At each stage, the box (in both its incarnations) seems to become heavier, charged with “insane energy”, carrying the accumulated psychic weight of its journey.Thrown into the mix are discussions of other boxes: Pandora’s box the flight recorders from doomed aeroplanes the mysterious container from Kiss Me Deadly (“what’s in the box?”) the conceptual box in which Schrödinger’s cat is simultaneously alive and dead – a subject that also haunted Carol Morley’s tangentially comparable Out of Blue. Beneath it all, an ambient soundtrack ebbs and flows, from low pulsing throbs to rhythmic beats and floating melodies, interspersed with whispered words (“I love you inside out”) and fragments of other movies – the voiceover from Sunset Boulevard the trailer for John Carpenter’s The Thing.You can feel the ghost of Derek Jarman in Kötting’s work: the use of collage the investigation of memory the allusions to Shakespeare’s The Tempest the deconstruction of cinema itself. Yet, The Whalebone Box has something even more personal in its subtle exploration of the bond between father and daughter, an expression of love that had me laughing one moment and crying the next. With such a tender, beating heart, this is in some ways Kötting’s most unexpectedly accessible work. And, as Eden says more than once in her subtitled voiceover: “It’s true!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed07eadada05ef8fc29acea27d707a86db6f08a8/0_121_2142_1286/master/2142..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a850f108d91fb348c73f87301cee377","title":"ireland replace mick mccarthy with stephen kenny euro 2020","story":"Mick McCarthy will not lead the Republic of Ireland into their Euro 2020 play-off against Slovakia after agreeing to put a premature end to his second stint in charge of his country. Stephen Kenny has stepped up from the under-21s to replace him with immediate effect.It was always the long-term plan for Kenny to follow McCarthy, but the expectation was that the latter would have the opportunity to complete the Euro 2020 campaign now he will not get that chance, as Ireland’s play-off against Slovakia, which was originally scheduled for March, has been pushed back until September. McCarthy’s contract was due to expire on 31 July and the Football Association of Ireland decided against extending it, instead sticking to the plan of allowing Kenny to take over. McCarthy and his assistant, Terry Connor, were informed of the decision on Saturday.Gary Owens, the FAI interim chief executive, said: “This has been a difficult situation for the Association – and for Mick and Stephen in particular – in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effect it has had on the football calendar. I want to thank both men for their professionalism and their understanding in their dealings with the Association in these unprecedented circumstances.“These are exceptional times in Irish life and Mick has taken that into account in agreeing to vacate the post early. On behalf of the FAI, I wish to express our gratitude to Mick for his service and commitment to our national team throughout his career and particularly in his second spell as Ireland manager.“Stephen will now begin his planning for the play-off against Slovakia and everyone at the FAI wishes him well in our bid to qualify for Euro 2020. Football will be back and we have so much to look forward to now in the autumn with the Nations League and the Euro 2020 play-off, followed by the World Cup qualifiers in early 2021.”McCarthy’s second reign lasted 10 matches and ended with October’s 2-0 defeat in Switzerland, the same opponents, coincidentally, who beat Ireland in November 2002 to finish his first stint in charge. October’s loss was Ireland’s only defeat during their latest qualifying campaign, in which they proved difficult to beat but struggled to score. They finished third in their group below Switzerland and Denmark, with their tally of seven goals in eight matches attesting to their creativity problems.Kenny, who enjoyed huge success in the League of Ireland with Dundalk and Bohemians, has a reputation for playing enterprising football. He has guided the country’s under-21s to the top of their Euro 2021 qualifying group, above opponents including Italy and Sweden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee68328e766d487a64ba387cf2ab1d1e034d2ac4/674_61_4779_2867/master/4779..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d5b50e18a464a9d376e331a09405f32","title":"the english game netflix","story":"The latest series from Julian Fellowes starts badly and barely improves but it is a reminder football has never stood stillYou can see how The English Game must have sounded in conception. It’s the birth of football. It’s toffs against proles, the rivalry of one of the great aristocrats of the early game, Lord Arthur Kinnaird, and the Glaswegian stonemason who was the first great professional, Fergus Suter. It’s about an idea going out into the world and being profoundly changed when it is taken up by the masses.But Netflix’s new series comes nowhere near what it might have been, and is little more than a mishmash of Downton Abbey stereotypes and trouble-at-mill cliches. The toffs are habitually awful, the banks are always foreclosing, and the proles, salt-of-the-earth brawlers and charmers that they are, can’t help themselves but get everybody unhelpfully pregnant.And the football? From the moment a minute in when Craig Parkinson, as the self-made mill-owner Walsh, tells Suter: “I’ve seen ’ow you play in Scotland. Your passing game is the future of football,” you know that subtlety, or characters who actually speak like real humans, isn’t what this is about. Still, for those who last saw Parkinson as the AC-12 officer Cottan in Line of Duty, where the plot revolved around the quest for the kingpin H and the implausible possibility that as he took his final breath he tapped out the letter in morse code, it’s something of a relief that here he eschews Hs altogether.The English Game does improve slightly after a truly dire opening episode, but the interest really lies in themes that are glimpsed almost out of the corner of the eye, shoved to the margins by the heavy-handed central narrative. Suter, for instance, is offered a huge lump sum plus improved wages to leave Darwen and join Blackburn Rovers, which he accepts because he needs the money to rescue his mother and sister from his abusive father. Quite aside from the issue of whether it’s legitimate, without any evidence, to portray an actual person, albeit one who died more than a century ago, as a wife-beater, there’s a more universal question. Why shouldn’t Suter take the better offer? Darwen had paid to lure him from Partick and then they themselves were outbid: once professionalism has been accepted, why should there be a perceived need to give Suter an excuse for moving?Other than giving one of the principal characters a troubled backstory, what is gained by blurring the central dilemma of professionalism, that without adequate checks money will dominate – something all too apparent in the super-club era – and that the transformation of the game into a job, while beneficial and necessary in opening it up to all, also inevitably erodes to an extent the camaraderie and athletic purity that are so central to the notion of sport as somehow spiritually improving?It’s a thought that occurs now in discussions about a putative super-league. It’s easy to rail against it, to anticipate the potential tedium of the same super-clubs endlessly grappling with each other, to think of the social damage done to the non-super-clubs cast into permanent semi-irrelevance by exclusion from the main competition, to rage against the victory of capital over community, but there’s always also a thought of how history will view the debate. After 10 or 20 years of a super-league, and the brilliant football it would probably yield, would those arguments come to seem as irrelevant as those that once doubted the European club competitions, or British involvement in the World Cup, or, yes, professionalism and the formation of a league?In The English Game, the toffs object to the working-class northern teams largely for reasons of status. And perhaps that’s how it was: after all, even leaving overt snobbism aside, it’s understandable that the university-educated teams who had codified the game not two decades earlier (in January 1864, the Football Association comprised eight south-eastern clubs plus Sheffield) would be resistant to an entirely different group of people taking over their game, particularly when they interpreted it in a very different way.The tactical exposition in The English Game is clunkingly preposterous, but it’s not without substance: the passing game the northern teams came to favour (in part because they were smaller than their better-fed public school counterparts and so would have been seriously disadvantaged if they had no way of manoeuvring the ball away from physical clashes) was very different to the head-on charging practised by the game’s progenitors.Although the point is not made explicitly in the series, the reason Darwen had to travel to London for their FA Cup quarter-final replay against Old Etonians in 1879 is that it was stipulated that all games from the quarter-finals onwards had to be played in London (the first match was not, as depicted in The English Game, played at Eton, but at Kennington Oval) – a not unreasonable requirement when most of the teams were based in the south-east. It’s notable that by the following season the regulation had been lifted, suggesting at least some flexibility on the part of the FA and a recognition that the geographic make-up of the game was changing.And it would go on to change, spreading across the world. The English game became the Austrian game, the Hungarian game, the Argentinian game and, particularly, the Uruguayan game. It became everybody’s game, interpreted differently by every culture that embraced it. And that in turn created difficulties – as demonstrated in the tours made by British clubs to South America in the first half of the 20th century, which often became fractious with mutual misunderstanding, laying the ideological foundations for the controversy that would, for instance, overwhelm the 1966 World Cup quarter-final between England and Argentina. One of the fascinations of football is that it is simultaneously intensely local and utterly globalised, with all the tensions that brings.But don’t expect to see any of that on Netflix, where the toffs drink claret and the proles drink beer (or whisky if they’re Scottish and having a bad time), the bank is forever foreclosing and an implausible number of goals are scored in the few seconds after kick-off. It’s a tremendous opportunity missed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff3b7a326dfcb2682275ae3172b73fd5ec29cba4/0_0_2796_1677/master/2796..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917143f6e873964e4d7f8584db5e4126","title":"footballers wages premier league","story":"Scrambling politicians, cut-throat club execs and an unobliging union have left Premier League players facing familiar ireA political football is normally the cliche of choice when something that has nothing to do with football is booted back and forth between agencies attempting to deflect blame. These are far from normal times, however, and in the past week football became political even though its practitioners are now self-isolating and invisible. Season suspended or not, Premier League players rounded on by a health secretary struggling to equip his own nurses know exactly how it feels to get a public kicking.There are, of course, wealthier institutions around the country than football clubs, and many millionaires and corporations that pay less tax. But even when out of sight, the recipients of the stratospheric salaries common in the Premier League – and to a lesser but still significant extent in the EFL – are clearly too obvious a target to be ignored when the rest of the population is being asked to make sacrifices.Difficult as it is to defend the amounts of money leading players are paid – it should not take a national emergency to make anyone wonder whether £200,000 a week might be on the generous side for anyone not involved in life-and-death situations – the country as a whole is suffering through a lack of leadership, knowledge and foresight at the moment and football is no different. As Gary Lineker bravely pointed out, though the scorn Tottenham and Newcastle attracted by cutting the wages of their non-playing staff while protecting the incomes of players was completely justified, it was a decision that came from the boardroom rather than the dressing room.Self-inflicted public relations damage does not get much more glaring, yet it was the players who bore the brunt of the resentment, not the billionaire owners. The players could do with someone to speak up for them on these occasions, someone to orchestrate a little positive PR, and not necessarily Gordon Taylor and the Professional Footballers’ Association, which like most trade unions is principally concerned with making sure the employers are not getting away with anything they shouldn’t.Forcing pay cuts on the players, for instance, does not automatically free up money for the groundstaff or the caterers, much less for frontline health workers. It merely leaves more in the club account for directors to decide how to disburse.The understanding from the rest of Europe is that most players were quite happy to forgo large proportions of large salaries at a time when they are not in action and the rest of the country is struggling.The likelihood is that players here feel the same. In fact there is already plenty of evidence through initiatives from Jordan Henderson, Harry Maguire and others that footballers were trying to make a contribution before Matt Hancock’s suggestion they needed to play their part.It is not quite the case that their union was holding them back by insisting on full payment of contracts, though the PFA was painfully slow in coming out and saying what it might do to help, leaving Crystal Palace’s Andros Townsend to voice the concern that players were being portrayed as villains.Even as Premier League clubs voted to send financial assistance to the EFL, the National League and the NHS on Friday, there was a sense of having to be seen to be doing the right thing after too many days of failing to come up with anything constructive.It would have been better to have the conversation about voluntary deferrals or charitable donations at the outset, as soon as it became clear players would be taking an extended break from their normal working pattern. As some of the wealthiest and most visible members of society it was inevitable and foreseeable that footballers might attract envy when many are suffering financial hardship, yet some of what we have seen was closer to scapegoating.Laudable though Henderson’s intentions undoubtedly are, and useful as his network of captains might prove, it is a pity players’ efforts will now be viewed as reactions to bad publicity when there was plenty of time and opportunity for such high-profile figures to be more proactive. Fingers can be pointed at the union or the owners but the game as a whole needs to take stock at this point.Footballers were already earning too much money before the game went into hibernation, it was only natural that their income would attract attention, and though some clubs did the honourable thing by their casual and matchday staff, a few others handled a delicate situation clumsily.Lessons need to be learned for next time, though goodness knows it is to be hoped there is no next time. To give everyone from the government down a break from accusations of complacency or ineptitude, no one knew in advance how to work through something on this scale.Mistakes were and are being made at every level, and the mistake we might still all be making is to assume that at the end of this period of unnatural quiet, a referee’s whistle will sound, the crowd will cheer and play will commence as usual.That seems to be the picture Uefa has in mind, with a dogged insistence that all leagues and competitions must be concluded, but if the world has changed in the last couple of months football will have no option but to change with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b5c3dcff82b3b8472382b43b2b4fd3a19071f8/0_1195_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a3242f98d4f07c721428969bd5c383","title":"steven appleby why i felt liberated when i started dressing as a woman ","story":"The author and cartoonist describes his heartfelt sense of freedom when he began to cross-dress openly all the timeI am a man who wears women’s clothes. The first time it happened was in the mid-70s. I’d recently left school and was a couple of months into an art foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic. I found myself on my own for a weekend in the flat I shared with two fellow students. Bored, I started rummaging down the back of the sofa to see what curiosities – or money – I might find. A moment later I pulled out a single stocking, which I immediately put on. Instinctively. Transgressively. It triggered years of guilt, self-disgust and confusion.So why did I put that stocking on?In the early 1960s, as a little kid, I’d watched my mother dress and, I think, just expected to grow up to be like her. However, I soon came to realise I was a boy, which I accepted… Until in my teens I came across an article in Oz magazine.Oz was a notorious alternative magazine and, as a rebellious, middle-class school kid, I sought out weird music, strange books and publications like International Times and the comics of underground cartoonists such as Robert Crumb and Gilbert Shelton. The piece in Oz was about a boy who wakes one morning to find himself transformed into a girl. In reality, it was an excuse to publish some titillating erotic photographs, but still… An idea had been planted and from that moment on I wasn’t content to be a boy.After the stocking incident, I started collecting items of girls’ clothing. I remember having a pair of tights and a pink one-piece swimsuit I’d rescued one holiday when my sister was having a clear-out. I kept them hidden at the back of a drawer and, when the compulsion became too strong, I’d wait until my flatmates were out and slip into them. All the while listening for a key in the front door and the creak of feet on the stairs.For years I agonised over why I was obsessed with dressing as a girl. Maybe there’d been a mess-up in my genes, or something had happened during my upbringing? Perhaps, God had made me like this… or maybe I even, somehow or other, decided it for myself. Whatever the reason – and eventually I decided the reason didn’t matter – I found myself floating through my late teens and 20s wishing I’d been born a girl and dressing as one in secret whenever the urge became irresistible. Afterwards, I’d be filled with feelings of sadness, fear and guilt. Sadness at being back in the real world of my male self fear of being discovered, and guilt at doing something I thought – no, I knew – was perverted and abnormal. I was clearly sick in the head.Back in the 60s and 70s transvestism was on a very long alphabetical list of sexual deviations. There were certainly no role models for a teenage boy obsessed with dressing as a girl. The only cross-dressers I ever saw were men playing women for laughs in films or on television – female impersonators such as Danny La Rue, comedians in the Carry On films or Monty Python’s Flying Circus. I was convinced that, dressed as a woman, I must look utterly ridiculous. A joke.Then, in 1981, something amazing happened. I moved to London and one day in a remainder bookshop found a copy of Dressing Up, Peter Ackroyd’s 1979 history of transvestism and drag. I learned that, for centuries, in almost every country in the world, men and women had worn each other’s clothes. I also saw Richard O’Brien’s Rocky Horror Picture Show – a glorious celebration of dressing up in women’s lingerie. It seemed I wasn’t quite as weird and alone as I’d thought.By the mid-80s my artwork was being published in newspapers and magazines and I couldn’t resist slipping my secret dressing-up obsession into my comic strips – disguised, of course. I peopled my cartoons with humans who feel compelled to dress as plants or fish aliens who camouflage themselves as coat hangers dissatisfied items of furniture – chairs, for example – who yearn to be tables. In my drawings, as in the real world, things weren’t always quite what they seemed.When the internet arrived in the 90s, one idle evening it occurred to me to type the word “transvestite” into an early search engine – and everything changed. Hundreds and thousands of pages of hits came down the wires and filled my computer screen. Millions of men, just like me, were wearing women’s clothes behind closed curtains and locked doors. I was not alone, I was one of many. If I was a pervert, then I was in the company of countless numbers of other perverts.Slowly, I started seeing cross-dressing as a positive, magical thing rather than a curse. In my arty way I began thinking of myself as transforming from a man into an exotic, mythical creature, like a faun, perhaps, except I was part boy and part girl, rather than part boy and part goat. In my head, putting on the clothes of the opposite sex gradually shifted from a sickness to feeling more like a delightfully naughty blessing. Dressing up was a way of stepping through a wardrobe from one world into another. It was liberating – and fun!I soon discovered there were clubs and events I could go to, from huge, all night dress-up parties where everyone with every possible kind of kink was welcome, such as Torture Garden, to more specifically trans-orientated clubs, like the WayOut – the first trans nightclub I ever went to.I remember my first visit vividly. The hours spent carefully applying makeup and trying on outfits the waiting until it got dark before daring to slip out of the house in case one of the neighbours saw me driving to the address convinced that everyone in the other cars could spot that I was a man sitting in the parked car until the street was deserted before opening the door and tottering, in unfamiliar shoes and skirt, to the club entrance. It was utterly terrifying and completely exhilarating at the same time.Transvestites began making appearances in my books and comic strips. A female version of myself featured in an episode of my BBC Radio 4 series, Steven Appleby’s Normal Life, and a musical play based on my work was titled Crocs in Frocks.Finally, I decided I’d had enough of leading a double life. My wife and siblings knew I cross-dressed – I’d come out to them in the late-90s, which had been terrifying because… what if they’d rejected me? Luckily they all accepted it as a part of my artistic temperament, I think. But, even so, I was finding that only being able to dress up once a week or so was stifling. I’d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to be honest and open and live as one. Also, I had young children and wanted them to grow up knowing their father as a complete person, not someone with a huge secret that would – inevitably – come out… What effect might that have had on our relationship?I took to wearing increasingly androgynous clothes, jewellery, nail varnish and a little subtle makeup – being careful not to embarrass my boys at school parents’ evenings – and began opening up about my transvestism to friends and employers.Thankfully, I never had a bad response. And then one day 12 years ago, I went out with my wife and two of our closest female friends on a shopping expedition to select a wig. Trying on a dozen different styles in the wig shop was great fun, but nothing looked quite right until I put on perhaps the 10th or 11th and everyone said unanimously: “That’s the one!” I left the shop wearing new hair – and stepped into a new, trans life.Back home, I stuck my head through the door into the sitting room and the boys barely looked up from watching TV. They didn’t seem to notice my change. I asked them about it recently and they said: “Dad, you were always just you.”For many years now I haven’t owned a single item of male clothing.

But being the man people look to for help is not always easy.“When you watch the news, they’re interested in telling you what’s happening,” he says. “I’m interested in telling you what you should do. So when someone’s desperate, and it’s someone for whom I don’t have an answer, that’s when I get really upset. That’s when I sit at my desk and I have a little cry. I find it really frustrating. I know I’m meant to be the person who can answer questions – but sometimes there isn’t an answer. And someone’s pleading with me to help them.”Isolated with his young family at his home in London, he has been clocking up 14-hour days to help workers who face poverty if they follow government advice and stay home.One heartbreaking plea came from a single mother whose employer insisted she continued with her non-essential job. She was caught between the impossible decision of not being able to afford to feed her children and taking them to work with her. “There are devastating holes in this system,” says Lewis.“Right now, I’m prioritising the bigger and more desperate needs in terms of getting information to try to help people. Many people are facing a destruction of income that is catastrophic for their financial and mental health.”Despite spending his life fighting for consumers, often speaking in deliberately combative terms about “rip-off” companies, he feels sympathetic to the plight of businesses hit hard by the lockdown. He is urging those who can afford it to accept vouchers instead of refunds for unusable tickets from airlines, theatres and festivals. “We want as few victims of coronavirus as possible, and that means, where we can, we need to show compassion and consideration – even to companies.”Over the past fortnight, Lewis – who sold his website for more than £80m in 2012 but remains editor-in-chief – has also set up his own fund for charities providing poverty relief during the outbreak.He has pledged £1.9m of his estimated £128m fortune to the fund, and is calling for more rich donors to join him. “I’m talking to people in charities who are just desperate, saying we want to help people but all our fundraising streams have dried up.”He hopes to keep workers in at least 400 charities in their jobs, as well as providing emergency funding to those most in need. But on a more emotional level, his donation “was partly to make myself feel better, if I’m honest. Because I thought: I can’t just sit here. I’ve got to do something. I’ve got to make sure, as best I can, that someone’s going to give these people food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0e7cf38ffff942decc68efd955e0a8e1b728ce/0_258_6439_3864/master/6439..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f532a97ac8f61df6b636e09d736ad6","title":"dua lipa future nostalgia review","story":"A leak brought forward the release of Dua Lipa’s second album.

Coronavirus, he said, had left “our towns and villages deserted” and had reminded us of “what really matters, our family, our friends, our relationships. The love we have for one another. Our health.”Starmer will begin appointing his shadow cabinet on Sunday, announcing who will fill the roles of shadow chancellor, shadow foreign secretary, shadow home secretary and shadow health secretary. A spokesman said it would reflect all views and represent all wings of the party: “The team Keir supports will reflect the breadth of talent across the party and will be a team ready to take on the task of winning the next general election.”Supporters of Starmer hope his success will put pressure on some of the key iniduals close to Corbyn, who have remain in senior posts after the disastrous general election defeat last December, to step down.These include Karie Murphy, Corbyn’s former chief of staff, and Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary, who is also close to the former Labour leader.In a scathing comment on the Labour’s failings of the last few years, Lord (Iain) McNicol, the party’s former general secretary under Starmer’s predecessor, told the Observer he was glad the Corbyn era was finally over. Starmer’s victory was, he said, a chance to recreate a “professional” party that could chart a route back to power.“Keir’s election provides the opportunity to rebuild a professional, election-focused party capable of leading the country, something that has been sorely missing over the past few years,” said McNicol.“Keir brings the energy, experience and political astuteness that we desperately need to reinvigorate our party. The sad fact that Labour has the lowest number of MP since the second world war tells you everything you need to know about the Corbyn experiment. I, like thousands in the Labour party, am thankful that that chapter is now closed.”Starmer made clear he would take whatever action was necessary to reform the party, including rooting out the “stain” of antisemitism. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he said. He will begin discussions this week with Jewish leaders.Long-Bailey, Nandy and Corbyn all congratulated Starmer and said they looked forward to working with him. Long-Bailey said: “Keir Starmer will make a brilliant prime minister and I cannot wait to see him in No 10. I will do all I can to make that a reality.”Nandy said that the current coronavirus crisis meant that Labour could rebuild trust fast and become the next government.“The road back to power is steep, but it does not have to be long,” she said. “Our country is crying for fresh leadership. We start today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0b627cd83bd79c484c40a4d7076f0700afc864d/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911d716ddb40df432026554432df4ab8","title":"my favourite game lithuania v bosnia herzegovina world cup qualifier 2013","story":"A 1,125-mile trek to Kaunas brought the Bosnian diaspora together to celebrate a momentous qualificationAbdulah had been the previous three days’ life and soul but now he stood still, arms outstretched, at the edge of a precarious concrete overhang. He was sprightly to a degree beyond his 70 years but, in any case, instinct had overtaken him. As the full-time whistle blew, and as Bosnia-Herzegovina began to absorb the scale of their achievement, he had vaulted a barrier at the front of this creaking Soviet-era stand’s top tier and wiped away tears before surveying the scene below. “Hajmo Bosno!” (“Go, Bosnia!”), he shouted through the misty air of an evening that would have seemed unremittingly bleak if something this momentous had not just occurred. “We did it!”I had travelled with Abdulah on one of a vast convoy of coaches from Sarajevo to the Lithuanian city Kaunas. The idea was to take the same 1,125-mile journey as many of the thousands who had dropped everything in anticipation of what lay at its end. If Bosnia won in Lithuania they would qualify for their first World Cup and, for a young country still recovering from the war of the early 1990s, the meaning of that achievement almost transcended explanation.But because football is about people and lives, and the stories that bind and explain both, there was no lack of willingness to seek the words. Abdulah had left Bosnia in 1968 to become an iron worker in Adelaide. When Brazil 2014 began to seem a realistic proposition, he saved up and took three flights to Sarajevo for a six-week visit that would overlap with Bosnia’s final four games. Being on this journey to Kaunas had lifted his soul, he said. He felt united with long-distant countrymen in a way that had never seemed possible.As the bus hugged the Bosna river before winding through Croatia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the forests of southern Lithuania, fuelled by rakia and laughter, the inidual tales kept coming. Elvir had sold a home to fund his odyssey through the team’s qualifiers, and hopefully to Brazil Adnan was a qualified lawyer but had worked all hours in a hardware store to fund his ticket Sabina was a disillusioned student with dreams of someday, somehow emigrating to Japan and would find a way of repaying her football-mad cousin for this week of escapism Michael was a German soldier, posted to Sarajevo as part of Nato and the UN’s post-war presence who could not bring himself to leave.It was a rag-tag crew, with shared sadnesses and deeply personal ones, too all joined in the expectation of a happiness whose vessel, a brilliant football team, they could never have foreseen. We arrived in Kaunas and so, it seemed, did the entire Bosnian diaspora. Laisves Aleja, the main street, played host to reunions of impossible poignancy. Cousins separated by war and then by oceans melted into each other’s arms. Childhood friends from Sarajevo or Mostar picked each other out in a crowd and retold stories that had gathered dust. And now they would go to the football together.It was a horrible game until the 68th minute. Safet Susic had composed a mesmerising attacking side propelled by Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic but little was coming off against a turgid Lithuania and the unthinkable looked increasingly real. Then Vedad Ibisevic found space in the box and jabbed into the net from six yards the Bosnians who had filled this unappealing little stadium could now turn it into the venue for a party they would remember forever – and one I will too.I woke the next morning with, for reasons that had faded into an endless night, Abdulah’s “Bosnia Adelaide” flag by my side. He had long departed on the return leg to Sarajevo I was to fly back to London from Kaunas. Soon after arriving home I posted it to his home address and, a couple of months later, received a note in reply: “Look forward to seeing you again in Sao Paolo, Brazil.” I did not make it there, but I have no doubt Abdulah did for him, and all the others, there would be no barrier high enough to stop them following the country they adored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55383818b00233792b6d46c3fc93a5966bc87d34/0_49_3531_2119/master/3531..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc52ac75ef32f769d9145093e24576a5","title":"rfu autumn internationals rugby union","story":"The Rugby Football Union is hoping it will not have to offer struggling governing bodies elsewhere any financial handouts after the autumn internationals, according to its chief executive.The RFU is reluctant to agree to sharing its revenue should the summer tours to the southern hemisphere fall victim to the coronavirus crackdown and the autumn internationals in Europe survive, as the English union is grappling with its own projected loss of up to £50m this year.Unions throughout the world are feeling the squeeze as rugby’s shutdown is set to be measured in terms of months rather than weeks. Australia, who are among the visitors to Twickenham in November, have made swingeing cuts. Elsewhere, USA Rugby has filed for bankruptcy.A decision on whether the summer tours will go ahead is expected at the end of the month but, with Australia shutting down its community game until at least 1 June, the fitness of playersunable to train with their clubs is a concern. Also, with a vital income stream cut off, the southern hemisphere nations would be reluctant to travel to Europe unless they received a share of the proceeds.“We are in discussions with everybody,” said Bill Sweeney, the RFU chief executive. “We are looking at the July tours and further forward with a blank sheet of paper in terms of how things will go and World Rugby may have a role to play in this.“Revenue sharing talks have been held in the past, but it is pretty important for us to maximise our revenues from the autumn internationals to make sure we can continue to invest in our game. We have to take that into consideration, but all options are on the table as we look for the best possible outcome.”“Conversations are ongoing,” said Sweeney. “The period has been extended because of what the crisis has done in terms of communication and the need to look at and reassess everything. The private equity markets have been turned on their heads in terms of shareholder value. At this moment, it is still going ahead and has not been derailed.”Sweeney is confident broadcasting values will not take a hit, with the Six Nations having started the tender process for the tournament in a package that will take in the autumn internationals of the sextet. “We believe there is an opportunity for the entire game to emerge stronger at the end of this,” he said. “If that is the case, we are looking at an improved product which becomes even more appealing from a broadcast point of view. That is the way we are approaching it and we are in discussions with terrestrial and pay TV. The tender process has been put on pause because everyone is looking at their own situation. We will pick it up again when things start returning to a bit more like normality.”The RFU is waiting to hear from the NHS after offering the use of Twickenham as a medical facility, the adjacent hotel as a dormitory for staff and a car park as a testing centre.The new contract for Eddie Jones does not include a clause governing what the England head coach says after matches despite his being forced to apologise to the referee Ben O’Keeffe of New Zealand last month after he claimed that the match against Wales had at the end been 16 against 13. “We work together on an ongoing basis about how we manage that,” said Sweeney.Jones added: “I made it clear that it was an inappropriate way to express my disappointment and I will definitely have a chat with him the next time I see him. He is a good young fella.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8af57f6e9a7e19700783d531a44e1290be9736/349_116_2622_1575/master/2622..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f3676604587b0d86e0e50b7bbbdc62","title":"loss of grand national 500m hole in racings balance sheet","story":"Any faint hope British racing would follow the lead of its Irish counterpart and attempt to stage its Grand National in the autumn has been swiftly extinguished, leaving an estimated hole of up to £0.5bn in the balance sheet of the sport, betting industries and the local economy, only a fraction of which will be covered by insurance claims.Jockey Club Racecourses, which owns Aintree, has not formally ruled out moving the race but it cancelled – rather than postponed – the 2020 race several weeks ago, shortly before new government restrictions on movement led to the current suspension of all British racing, and there is no expectation the situation will change.Some of JCR’s costs – such as refunding tickets – will be covered by its insurance policy, but revenue generated during the three-day Aintree Festival, from on-course betting, bars, restaurants and so on, will be lost. The total estimated loss for the track, its owners and nearby businesses is expected to reach around £60m.Bookmakers, meanwhile, will be missing out on around £400m in turnover, and their best annual opportunity to attract new customers. The Scottish Grand National, which was due to be staged at Ayr on 18 April, is also one of the most popular betting races of the year.Ireland cancelled the remainder of its 2019-20 jumps season this week, including the Punchestown Festival at the end of this month, but will still aim to reschedule the Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse as part of an “enhanced” jumping programme later in the year.The Grand National at Aintree, however, is a much bigger beast than its Irish counterpart by any measure, from its attendance (65,000 versus 12,500) to its traditional build-up over many months.The 1997 Grand National was restaged as a standalone event two days later, in front of around 20,000 spectators, after it was postponed from its traditional Saturday slot following a bomb scare at the course.Even that required immense effort, however, and a two-day delay when much infrastructure was already in place is different to a move to an as yet unspecified date in the autumn when restrictions on large gatherings could still be in place. The National is also the ultimate target for many horses at the outset of the jumps campaign and a shift to the opening weeks of the season could have knock-on effects on top-level National Hunt racing at other tracks for months afterwards.As is the case for so many businesses, lost revenue will not be retrieved when the lockdown ends and it could be months, or even years, before the economy recovers from the effects of the current lockdown. The one cause for optimism, however, as racing counts the cost of losing the entire Grand National meeting for the first time since 1945, is that Tiger Roll, the race winner in 2018 and 2019, is expected to return in 2021 to attempt a third success."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a8e58113151bfc2eab6011e2b0226934101eab/0_195_3162_1898/master/3162..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a7305f7f307d4e23b0ab6c6b1e938e","title":"shakespeares secret co writer finally takes a bow 430 years late","story":"Thomas Watson recognised by literary scholars as the Bard’s forgotten 16th-century collaboratorHe was one of the most celebrated English playwrights of the 16th century, yet none of his plays survived, and today the name of Thomas Watson is virtually unknown. Now the writer, poet and pioneer of the English madrigal – who also saved the life of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in a street brawl – is being seen in a new light.Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of Arden of Faversham, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play’s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare.Based on a notorious murder of 1551, Arden is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to “wash away this blood”, just like Lady Macbeth.Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is “strong and consistent evidence” for his authorship.Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as “Watson’s heire” by William Clerke, in a work titled Polimanteia, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright.“Almost everything Watson did was original,” said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of The New Oxford Shakespeare. “Even specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.”Taylor’s new research will be published in The Review of English Studies later this year. He is also among leading contributors to Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594 , a major reappraisal of Shakespeare’s early career, to be published this month by Cambridge University Press. This will contain essays by various scholars, including one by Taylor titled Arden.Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: “Taylor’s identification of Watson’s hand in Arden … is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare’s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist. Watson was also extremely well-connected within London’s literary scene that he collaborated with Shakespeare, who was then in his mid-20s, reveals the sorts of influential circles the ambitious Stratford man moved in at the very beginning of his career.”Taylor said: “We’re looking for a writer who is capable of writing a great play. Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous.”Arden authorship contenders have included Thomas Kyd, who wrote The Spanish Tragedy. Taylor said: “Watson looks more likely than any other writer of the 1580s or early 1590s. As a native Londoner with legal training, born in the 1550s and praised by his contemporaries as an early master of tragedy in the commercial theatres, Watson shares the biographical profile that first led critics to suspect Kyd’s hand in the play.”He added: “A lot of the material is funny, and Watson … was also famously funny. In 1596, one writer remembered ‘the froth of witty Tom Watson’s jests’.”Among other biographical evidence, Taylor draws parallels between Arden and Watson’s defence of Marlowe when he was attacked in the street in 1589: “The husband who would be famously murdered is defended by a friend in an earlier attack. That incident in the play is not in the historical sources. It’s totally made up by the playwright. The friend is also totally made up.”Taylor has compared Arden with Watson’s surviving literary prose and poetry, using databases of playwrights working between 1585 and 1595. The study revealed that “some features of Arden are shared with no one but Watson”.He added: “If Watson did write most of Arden, then we need to seriously consider him for other plays written before September 1592 when he died, probably of the plague.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac02aae4a0abb0fb00b694db371c300d5024f9d4/0_250_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46bb92bda18530324892724f24404e65","title":"call for social media platforms to act on 5g mast conspiracy theory","story":"After a spate of fires, the government is stepping in to halt the spread of linking coronavirus to the mobile networkThe government is to hold talks with social media platforms after mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Merseyside and Belfast were set on fire amid a widely shared conspiracy theory linking 5G networks to the coronavirus pandemic.Broadband engineers have also faced physical and verbal threats by people who believe that radiation from 5G masts causes health risks and lowers people’s immune systems.The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, revealed he had received threats after he dismissed the theory as “bizarre”.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove branded the conspiracy theories “dangerous nonsense”.And the NHS director, Stephen Powis, added: “The 5G story is complete and utter rubbish.

But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28e68bd3bbd8f586758073ed4899075d8b72ad5b/296_0_5569_3345/master/5569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac2443d12a969f005404126eed10f53","title":"locals guide to venice through virtual reality music films books podcasts","story":"Venetian photographer Giacomo Cosua takes us on a tour of La Serrinimisa, through films, music, books, podcasts and virtual realityVenice suffered apocalyptic flooding on 12 November 2019. The scenes are perfectly mirrored in the photography book Era Mare, a local initiative by photographer Matteo de Mayda and two graphic designers– all the profits are used to help the city survive. Rather than the usual pictures of a submerged Piazza San Marco, the book is an artistic documentary of the suffering of not just historic buildings, but the daily lives of local people during what we now term acqua grande.I was recently taking pictures of Venice emptied of people during the lockdown, and found myself in one of its most beautiful spots, the Campiello dei Miracoli. Well, we all need a miracle right now, but what came to mind was a scene from my favourite film set in Venice, Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), featuring stars Bruno Ganz and Licia Maglietta outside a florist – which of course never existed. I think many Venetians would cite this as their favourite film, because it does not try to glamorise the city as Death in Venice does.Living here, we have to contend with filmmakers regularly taking over the city, but I have a soft spot for James Bond. Venice has been used as a backdrop for several 007 adventures. The scenes of Roger Moore zooming around our canals in a motorised gondola in Moonrakerstill make me laugh today.Few people associate Venice with football, but the Venezia FC stadium is just by the Biennale Gardens, and our team is one of the few things that belong to Venetians and not tourists. To get a feel, listen to Minuto per Minuto (raiplayradio.it), Italy’s cult radio soccer programme, commenting on a day of games at the end of last season that saved Venezia FC from relegation. If the Italian gets too complex, fast forward to the last 10 minutes when we scored three goals to survive!My mamma is a great cook, and the Sgaialand.it podcast evokes one of the most traditional Venetian dishes, risotto di go - goby fish risotto, which was much loved by Anthony Bourdain - as recounted by the owner of one of the city’s most famous restaurants, Al Colombo di Venezia.Three museums along the Grand Canal that rarely draw the usual crowds are Ca’Pesaro, for contemporary art, Palazzo Mocenigo, for textiles and fashion, and the Museum of Natural History. A virtual tour combining all 3 will certainly make you want to come back and visit the real thing once life returns to normal. Kids will be entranced by the dinosaurs, romantics will adore the period costumes in Mocenigo, and modern art lovers will be surprised at Ca’Pesaro’s collection.Several of the major islands on the Venice lagoon – Torcello, Murano, Burano – have their own specialist museums. Normal years see many tourists heading to Murano to visit its famous glass-blowing furnaces, so the Museo del Vetro there is usually busy. But the virtual tour offers a chance to discover one of the world’s most important collections of glass, from Roman times to contemporary designers. There is an ongoing campaign by Murano’s master glassblowers to protect their heritage against fakes that are often made in China, and even a virtual tour opens your eyes to the incredible craftsmanship that makes the island’s glass unique.Avant-garde works by Claudio Ambrosini may not be for everyone, but he is one of Italy’s most respected living composers and has won many awards, including the Golden Lion of the Venice Musica Biennale. His works – try 3 Studi En Plein Air: No 1 Notturno – have been performed in some of the world’s major concert halls.Ambrosini’s work has also been staged at our Fenice Opera House, and its website is also worth a visit to enjoy a full performance of Verdi’s Don Carlos, while right now there is a moving video of a quartet performing Debussy’s Clair de Lune as a homage to healthcare workers, each musician quarantined in their own apartment.A very different sound is Pitura Freska, every Venetian’s favourite band. Playing a mix of ska, reggae and rock, singing in our dialect about the city’s problems, they are as much a part of Venetian culture as Vivaldi. The band split up long ago, but their music lives on. When I am travelling, their album Na Bruta Banda transports me straight back to Venice.• Giacomo Cosua is a Venetian photographer and founder of the online Posi+Tive Magazine This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Is the start of a bright future?“I’m Ethan. I’m 17. Apparently, girls love me.” Ethan stares dead-eyed at the camera, daring us to contradict him. Love that “apparently”. Mind you, I would like to hear the girls’ side of the story.But there is a more pressing problem. If Ethan, a willowy Mancunian with frizzy ginger hair, matching freckles and an unexpectedly beguiling smile, is going to break into the modelling business, he will have to have a word with himself. “We can’t represent anybody that’s involved in criminality,” says Nigel, the head of a model agency that calls itself, presumably ironically, Nemesis.Ethan has a rap sheet as long as the East Lancs Road. Bored, he lists his crimes: “Possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, possession of class B drugs with intent to supply, possession of a bladed article in a public place, two robberies, perverting the course of justice, two affrays …” Hold on, Ethan, mate. “Bladed article”? Isn’t the word “knife”?Model: From Street to Catwalk (BBC Three) profiles two buff young Manc geezers trying to escape their humble lives to become paid clothes hangers for athleisurewear. While Ethan is trying to escape a life of crime, Jordan is hoping to get out of his life of grime. His nine-to-five as a labourer involved shovelling rubble and gutting soon-to-be gentrified properties that the likes of him would never be able affordon their current wages.Jordan shows his mother pictures that Nemesis’s photographers have taken of him to establish his credentials for potential clients. “Manchester look, chavvy, know what I mean?” he explains. “You can be called worse things, can’t ya?” she tells him as she scrolls.Jordan was scouted one night while walking around town. “He typifies everything we’re looking for right now,” says Nigel. “We want you to look like that, to be a lad, a scally, but we actually want you to be professional about it.” Jordan’s problem is that, in trial photo shoots, he didn’t project himself with the verve he had displayed in his natural habitat. “He’s a Manchester lad. He’s got that gritty northern look, if you like.”Ethan and Jordan are the success stories, the pair who are selected from a waiting room of 20 possibles. Some of the 18 rejects, though, were more handsome. But that is not the point. What Nemesis wants is not looks. It is a look. An attitude. If you are to be persuaded to purchase trackie bottoms and a no-less-flammable top, you won’t want to buy them just because the model is gorgeous. You will want to buy into the lifestyle inscribed on the model’s body and clobber. You must be made to believe that their badass strut, thousand-yard stare and ostensibly antinomian persona can be yours for the price of a hoodie.The day before Jordan’s first assignment, his mum texts him: “Bed at 9pm for you gotta look after that face get your bum hole waxed.” Some mothers hope their sons will be doctors, others that they will be cosmetically enhanced where the sun don’t shine. “I don’t think they’ll be getting many shots of my bum hole, Mum.” Well, probably not for his first client, JD Sports. But you never know, Jordan, what future clients may require. Best be, like the Scouts, prepared.I would have liked more on what it is like to be a man and to be objectified by photographers for a living, but neither Ethan nor Jordan reflect on that aspect of their chosen profession. But both nail what it means to them. “It’s a bit easier staying still taking pictures than robbing people and selling their stuff – and at least it’s legit,” says Ethan.Jordan’s first day as a model pays more than a week’s labouring. Like boxing or football for previous Ethans and Jordans of this world, modelling could be an escape from the streets. Fingers crossed they will emulate another success story, 23-year-old Ruby, who has been modelling for less than a year and already earns more than £10,000 a month. If she cracks the US, she could triple that. “She’s got the badass look,” explains a Nemesis functionary. “We know she will sell for us.” We see her shooting in a Welsh quarry, the grey slate rhyming with her tough-girl check strides and black quilted puffer jacket. If I wanted to look like a badass young woman, I would definitely buy what Ruby is modelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b41c5431e28234fe72b17821d60575c032e82a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75a247fce8666035c4ce1090946be5e","title":"andrew cuomo profile coronavirus new york","story":"The governor of New York’s calm Covid-19 briefings have made him the most prominent Democrat of the crisisIt’s rare for a single US state governor to get so much attention it even rivals the president during a historical national crisis – but that’s exactly what New York’s Andrew Cuomo is experiencing.Cuomo, the technocratic three-term governor who’s had to deal with the state hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, has emerged as the most prominent Democrat in charge of fighting the virus, filling a role many felt former vice-president Joe Biden should be occupying.But while Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee set to fight Trump for the White House in November, has been holed up in his basement streaming online briefings, it is Cuomo who has loomed far larger in America’s fight against Covid-19. Cuomo’s televised daily press conferences – calm, measured and honest – have emerged as the rival to Trump’s chaotic and misleading evening broadcasts.Though Cuomo has vociferously denied harboring presidential ambitions, it is telling that speculation about a future Cuomo run for the White House is now one of the hottest topics in US politics – a remarkable turnaround for a politician widely disliked by America’s resurgent left wing.But the age of the coronavirus has upset conventional politics around the globe and there is no doubt Cuomo has seized his moment.“I’ve been very very impressed by the way in which he’s approached it,” the former Washington governor Gary Locke, an ex-chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said. “Very frank, very honest – upfront. Preparing the people, presenting facts so that the public is not caught off guard, they know what to expect. He’s very even-keeled and I think the public appreciates that. He’s not trying to gloss over things, the magnitude, the severity of the pandemic.”Governors are usually some of the more aloof elected officials in the pantheon of American politicians. Often they’re less well-known than senators or members of Congress, and their power varies from state to state.It’s virtually unheard of for any politician – other than the president – to have his press conferences aired live on major cable networks daily, but that’s just what has happened with Cuomo. Cuomo’s briefings always feature the governor and his deputies on a panel, with Cuomo delivering an update on the number of infected cases in New York and then a description of how his administration is fighting the virus.Often – and unlike Trump – Cuomo will admit where New York is falling short on equipment. He is frank that the crisis won’t end tomorrow or any time soon.“In general, I am tired of being behind this virus. We’ve been behind this virus since day one,” Cuomo said at a press conference last week. “Everybody wants to know one thing: when is it over? Nobody knows. ‘Well, the president said by Easter, this one said by this’ … nobody knows. But I can say this: it is not going to be soon.”He will also, without hesitation, praise the Trump administration when he feels it is merited and then separate himself from the president the next minute. He will also share when he’s recently had a call with Vice-President Mike Pence or Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and an influential adviser in the Trump administration. He has repeatedly stressed New York’s deficit of ventilators.“The federal government is a partner in this obviously. I spoke to the president again yesterday about the situation, I spoke to the vice-president, I spoke to Jared Kushner,” Cuomo said. “The White house has been very helpful.”Cuomo’s visibility is a dramatic flip from just a few months ago, before the coronavirus crisis.For years he’s been known as a technocratic governor reviled by the most hardcore liberal sections of the Democratic party. He has cut deals with Republicans and repeatedly angered progressives. Many Democrats sometimes snicker at the thought of him doing retail politics in early voting states like Iowa, where endless hours of handshakes and diner visits are seen as non-negotiable facts of campaign life.Yet Cuomo’s New York speeches, his personal tangents about how his mother is responding to the pandemic or how frightened he is about his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, having contracted coronavirus, have matched the moment more than any other governor in the nation.“I’m frightened for my brother. I’m worried about my brother – as everyone is worried about their humanity and everyone they love,” Cuomo said at his press conference on Wednesday as news of Chris’s infection broke.New York politicians are constantly under the national spotlight. Rudy Giuliani became “America’s mayor” for how he handled the city’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center. More recently, at the beginning of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand was a top-tier contender before failing to gain any real traction.Cuomo’s name had been bandied about as a potential candidate for 2020 but he took only a modest look at running for president before deciding against it, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those considerations.Cuomo has never been a friend of grassroots progressives and he has repeatedly defeated leftwing challengers. When he ran for re-election in 2014, his more liberal primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout, became a national progressive icon for challenging the establishment-aligned Cuomo. In 2018, when Cuomo ran again, he faced another challenge from his left, that time from the former Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon, who became the darling of liberals hoping to oust the incumbent governor.The common liberal critique of Cuomo is that his administration has been rife with corruption and his agenda has been too deferential to centrists and the right.“The Democratic party has spent the past two decades moving away from its New Deal values and refusing to unequivocally stand up for working people – and Governor Cuomo embodies this shift to the center,” said Monica Klein, a New York-based progressive Democratic strategist.“The governor has consistently led New York as a corporate Democrat – slashing funding for hospitals, public schools and affordable housing instead of raising taxes on the wealthy. If Democrats want to take back the White House, we need to once again become the party for working people – and leaders like Cuomo are doing the exact opposite,” Klein added.He is the son of the former New York governor Mario Cuomo, who memorably decided against running for president at the last moment in 1992. He has known Trump for years. His personal life has been the subject of local and national scrutiny. His first marriage was to Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of the late Robert F Kennedy. Cuomo’s romances and breakups have been documented in the New York and national press (including more recently his breakup with longtime partner and Food Network star Sandra Lee).These days, Cuomo’s prominence has earned him a new level of attention. His press conferences have even sparked speculation around the internet over whether he sports a nipple ring.But it is Cuomo’s actions that have won him acclaim. He has taken an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach to fighting the virus. He has pleaded for more ventilators, worked with the federal government, issued strict edicts on isolating, and talked with business leaders privately.Despite all the praise and attention, however, and mutterings over White House ambition, Cuomo has solidly stuck with supporting Biden.When his brother asked him on CNN if he was thinking about running for president, Cuomo kept saying no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c5deaab2ef72b9d7a5727b14043d61a4db2991b/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b79119d753b7e2b3c0be48d55069f2","title":"desolate new york eerie photos ghost metropolis coronavirus","story":"Covid-19 has struck New York – and the world’s most dynamic city has become something strange and unsettlingby Jordan Gale, words by  J Oliver Conroy“It is a miracle that New York works at all,” EB White once wrote. “The whole thing is implausible.”Every New Yorker instinctively understands the truth of that observation. The city’s infrastructure is a disaster its apartments are famously tiny everything is overpriced there are too many people in too small a space and the whole city will one day have to reckon with the ravages of an encroaching sea.Yet New York has grown from a tiny New World trading post to a muscular global metropolis whose very name evokes dynamism and fierce, unruly vitality. It has survived booms, busts, world wars, the threat of cold war nuclear annihilation, 911, gentrification and more, and thrived. The city swallows people of every nation and language and spits out New Yorkers it generates vast fortunes and it is responsible for a dazzling expression of art, literature, music and intellectual life. By comparison many other world capitals feel like sleepy museum exhibitions.Now, however, this city of eight million people has met its match: a deadly virus, invisible to the human eye and ruthlessly efficient. Covid-19 has stretched New York’s health infrastructure to breaking point. Every day cases, and deaths, mount. A military hospital ship is docked, imposingly, in New York harbor. There are field hospitals in Central Park. Millions of New Yorkers have shut themselves into their homes.This is a city under quarantine. “No longer were there inidual destinies,” Albert Camus writes in The Plague: “Only a collective destiny, made of plague and emotions shared by all.”The photographer Jordan Gale ventured out to capture this strange new world.In Woody Allen’s film Manhattan, the narrator found it impossible to look at the city without feeling that it “pulsated to the great tunes of George Gershwin” – the jazzy, life-affirming exuberance of Rhapsody in Blue. Yet New York, now, is eerily quiet.“Any noise you hear is startling,” Gale said. He was walking down a street in SoHo when he realized that the only sound was a clip on his camera bag, clacking as he walked.“The city is a vacant lot,” he said. “Roads are empty. Sidewalks are empty. Stores are boarded up. The owners clearly believe looting could start any minute.”In residential areas occasional people can still be seen in the street they are making expeditions to the grocery store or bodega or taking the daily walks which increasingly feel like a minimum mental health requirement. The commercial areas of New York, on the other hand, are ghost towns.Times Square, a crowded intersection most New Yorkers gladly cede to tourists, has been abandoned by both. “You can take a photo down 42nd Street and there’s not a single person, a single car,” Gale said. “The only people you see are other photographers.”The more iconic the landmark, the more empty and unsettling. Grand Central Station looks like a “tomb”, he said.“It’s eerie. To take a photo of Grand Central like that, normally, you’d need some kind of special clearance – you’d need to shut down the whole place.”Many parts of the city, he noted, look cleaner than they have been in years, thanks to diligent scrubbing and disinfecting. The ground, however, is littered with blue vinyl gloves and broken surgical masks.When New Yorkers come out to scout for provisions their faces are concealed with whatever they can find – surgical masks scarves painters’ masks bandannas draped across their faces like outlaws in the old west. As they pass in the street, they keep a wary distance if they acknowledge each other it is with terse, silent nods.When people do talk, all conversations in some way concern the coronavirus. The rest of America tends to regard New Yorkers as liberal, unflappable, even heedless but these days New Yorkers sound like rightwing survivalists. They speak of stockpiles, shortages, contingencies, plans.Everyone knows someone who has lost their income to coronavirus, or been hospitalized. Everyone wonders when the present predicament will “end” – but, of course, no one knows, and for New Yorkers, like people the world over, that may be the hardest part of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06019da04bec902f87b45231ab160b8fe54bc01/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=354e01309447590324f1c9d5c411fb0e","title":"us 2020 presidential election coronavirus future","story":"As unthinkable events unfold over coronavirus, experts say no one knows if the election will happen as scheduled – and Trump is in a ‘precarious position’The coronavirus pandemic has taken a wrecking ball to the Olympics, Edinburgh Festival and UN’s Cop26 climate conference. In America, presidential primary elections have gone down like skittles, the Democratic national convention has been postponed and campaigns are frozen in time.All of which raises the question: can the 2020 general election itself survive?The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and Donald Trump has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded in the last month.“We’re in completely uncharted waters here and I don’t think anybody knows what’s going to happen,” said Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York. “By November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don’t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There’s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in only election.”The profound uncertainty has upended political campaigns like nothing else in living memory. It was a month ago – 3 March – that the former vice-president Joe Biden won 10 states on Super Tuesday, the biggest day in the primary calendar, and took firm control of the Democratic race. Trump, meanwhile, was holding regular campaign rallies in packed arenas.Now, Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium – television – with daily coronavirus taskforce briefings from the White House. Polls suggest he is benefiting moderately from a “rally around the flag effect”.Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US death toll from the virus expected to top 100,000. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held midterm elections in 1918 even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide.Fifteen states and one territory have postponed their primaries already this year, denying Biden the chance to knock out his rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, sooner rather than later. But Wisconsin intends to go ahead next week, despite legal challenges, an objection from Sanders and shortages of poll workers that could force the national guard to step in.June will now be a bumper month, with nearly 700 delegates up for grabs in 10 states and the District of Columbia on 2 June alone – assuming the primaries can go ahead. On Thursday the Democratic National Committee announcing it was delaying its presidential nominating convention in Milwaukee by a month until the week of 17 August.But changing general election day would be much more difficult. Faced with the inconsistency of states voting on different dates, Congress passed a law in 1845 that stipulated federal elections must be held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November (the day and time of year were chosen to suit farmers).Congress would have to pass a new law to postpone the 2020 election and even then would run into constitutional hurdles stating the new Congress must be sworn in on 3 January and the new president’s term must begin on 20 January.The inauguration date was set in 1933 when the 20th amendment to the constitution was ratified. There have only been 27 amendments in all. To make another, revising the inauguration date, would require approval by a two-thirds majority of both the House of Representatives and Senate, then ratification by three-quarters of the states.If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. But 17 states require some kind of excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election.Robert P Jones, founder and chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), said: “There is a patchwork of state constitutions. The west coast is ahead of the curve whereas other states might have to scramble. One challenge is the United States postal service is economically unstable, so vote by mail may not be as simple as it seems right now.”Such logistical problems could fuel concerns over the result in what is expected to be another very close election, Jones added. “We could end up with concerns about the legitimacy of the election. Last time it was only 10,000 votes in Michigan. It’s not hard to think we might have votes misdirected or ‘return to sender’.”Party politics are already a factor. Democrats sought $2bn in funding for absentee and vote-by-mail options in the recent coronavirus emergency relief bill but only got $400m. Trump admitted on Fox News: “The things they had in there were crazy. They had things – levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”At Friday’s White House coronavirus taskforce briefing he elaborated by claiming without evidence: “I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting. I think people should vote with ID – voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. “It shouldn’t be mail-in voting. It should be: you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up – all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated.”Republicans have long stoked fears of fraud in mail-in voting. But according to the Washington Post, in Washington state’s last election, 4.4m ballots were cast but fewer than a hundred were flagged and none led to a criminal fraud investigation.What remains unknown is whether the pandemic will help or hurt Trump at the ballot box. He declared a national emergency on 13 March but has been fiercely condemned for previously downplaying the virus, squandering crucial weeks and leaving the country unprepared. The president has “has blood on his hands”, argued the Boston Globe editorial board this week, while Biden’s supporters say the former vice-president would bring precisely the stable leadership the country needs.Jones explained: “We’re seeing a typical American reaction at times of national crisis, a ‘rally around the flag effect’. It happened with George W Bush after 911 and Barack Obama after the killing of Osama bin Laden. But on this one, we’re looking at something different, the very front edge of the US finally taking this seriously.“That’s what we’re registering: people saying he’s stepping up and taking it seriously after months of playing it down. Trump is getting points for showing up he was largely absent in January and February. The real test will be: what will it look like a month from now?”Robert Griffin, research director of the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, agreed that the “rally around the flag effect” is benefiting the president but noted that, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, it was not only Bush but also state governors who saw a rise in their approval ratings.“The effect is not necessarily related to performance or what the government is doing,” he said. “By historical standards, the effect for Trump is smaller than you’d expect and smaller than we’ve seen for other world leaders. His approval rating has not really changed that much and, for the 2020 election, it’s not moved the needle at all.”Trump’s central re-election argument was the economy, but the coronavirus outbreak has caused the quickest collapse the US job market has ever seen, throwing 10 million people out of work in just two weeks, and destroyed countless businesses. Griffin said: “Economic shocks in an election year are about as bad as it could get in terms of timing for a president seeking re-election. How are the American people going to interpret the action of this administration?”Trump’s critics believe that, pandemic or no pandemic, he was always doomed to defeat. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: “Trump was in trouble and I still think he is. As the autopsies go down on his handling of this, it’s not a good story.“Trump does not have discipline and that has been the case all through his presidency. He does not take advice. He’s headstrong and he insists on what his gut tells him to do. He’s in a precarious position and I don’t think this pandemic changes it. If anything, it illustrates why he’s in that precarious position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0577dfbf855b7b3d3be1bc83ce34b073a06ec744/0_101_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec5960e55adef82527068dd2b9f9eea9","title":"bernie sanders campaign assessing coronavirus","story":"The Sanders campaign has repurposed its efforts to helping fight the pandemic – is it possible he’ll succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?Bernie Sanders is not done running for president and he’s tired of saying so.“For the fourth time,” Sanders said tartly in an interview on The View this week, “we are assessing the campaign.”It was a response – more diplomatic if no less irritated than previous versions – to a variation on a question he’s been getting for weeks: “Why are you still in the race?”Sanders has faced calls to drop out since early last month, when Joe Biden began his all-but unstoppable ascent to the nomination. But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted.Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than 7,000 lives and nearly 10 million jobs. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net.“In many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,” said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. “Reality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.”Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the “scale of a major war”. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared – and more resilient – in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place.But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a isive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton’s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party.“It’s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,” Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. “If he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it’s for Bernie Sanders.”On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden’s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a “narrow” one.After a dismal showing last month, the campaign deactivated its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was ramping up digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.“We’ve had enough debates,” the former vice-president said.Sanders’ allies are split. Some have said it’s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention. “Campaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,” Sanders said on NBC’s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. “So that’s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.”Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he’s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.“He’s a friend,” Biden said. “I don’t want him to think I’m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you’re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.”Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they erge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.“Our healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,” said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. “And I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.”Sanders’ advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn’t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.“Single-payer will not solve that at all,” Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.“Oh my God, the universe is collapsing!” he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. “Oh my word, will the universe survive?”The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, passed unanimously.On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as “the boldest legislation ever written in modern history”.They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all iniduals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and several legal challenges to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new poll from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, “assessing” his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?“Right now in this unprecedented moment in American history,” Sanders told The View, “I think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd085f71aad5cda21dc89b67df7374f3abf7c0dd/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71d4c00188150a8379107867041f2350","title":"french reality show seeks to turn around lives of dunce pupils les cancres","story":"Les Cancres (The Dunces) features pupils coached by celebrities who also struggled at schoolFrench schoolchildren learn an early lesson that failure in the classroom is likely to mean failure in life.Pupils are encouraged to compete for the best marks and grades that will allow them to study at prestigious grandes écoles and subsequently become part of France’s professional or political elite.Now a new television series aims to show all need not be lost for those who fall by the academic wayside.Les Cancres (The Dunces) features a group of high-school pupils who are coached by French celebrities who also struggled at school, some of whom left without obtaining their baccalauréat - the bac - the multi-subject exam that is the equivalent of A Levels.The first two episodes, made by RMC Story, feature French-Moroccan stand-up comic Gad Elmaleh and rapper Black M. Businessman Adrien Aumont, co-founder of the crowdfunding site KissKissBankBank and novelist Cécile Ladjali also feature in the series along with Joël Bouraïma, a sports coach for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.“Anything is possible, that’s the message we’re trying to get across … but that doesn’t mean anything is easy,” Bouraïma said. “Of course, part of it is luck, but more important is work and determination, that’s how the celebrities we feature on the programme succeeded.”Cécile Ladjali added: “I’m a former dunce and I was told I’d be a sales person in a clothes shop … in the end I have a doctorate, I’m a novelist and also a professor.”In his 2010 book, On Achève bien les Écoliers (They Shoot School Kids, Don’t They?) author Peter Gumbel asks: “Why is France the only country in the world that discourages children because of what they cannot do, rather than encouraging them to do what they can?”“The whole French hierarchy, political and business, is predicated on people who have done well at school and who go on to the grandes écoles. More than anywhere else, it is the bac that is going to determine what your career choices are. It’s very difficult to make a success of life in France if you don’t have it,” Gumbel told .“The marking system is not designed to encourage students or improve their work, it about competing. How you do at school follows you for life and it’s very hard to break away from that. If you don’t have the bac you’re considered on the heap.”The students in the first Les Cancres included Lucille who failed to turn up for her baccalauréat exam.“My mother cried and said I’d finish up in a soup kitchen or the job centre”. Lucille said. She has now changed schools and is hoping to take the exam.Nicolas Cennac, the documentary producer said the aim of Les Cancres was to “represent people who have a different experience at school but who have enormous gifts”. He said his aim was to avoid stigmatising the pupils while at the same time not “glamourising” failure.Among leading French personalities who have succeeded without passing their baccalauréat are actors Catherine Deneuve and Gérard Depardieu, singer Vanessa Paradis, billionaire François Pinault, president of the luxury group Kering, fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and multiple Michelin starred chef Alain Ducasse. Emile Zola failed the exam twice.On Friday, the French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, announced that for the first time the baccaluaréat exams would not take place this year but pupils would be awarded the diploma on the basis of “continued evaluation” of their work at school. It is the first time the exam that was created in 1808 and has been sat every year since, even through the Nazi occupation, has been cancelled. French pupils are being expected to follow a full programme of online classes during the closures.Gumbel said the French education minister was “in a tight corner” because the French system was not adapted to home working.“In France teaching methods don’t lend themselves well to being done online. Normally the teacher is at the front of the class talking and everyone else is taking notes. It doesn’t work when it has to be interactive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976639c5b8700e8cd99aa144c07b87b2162e7a07/0_107_5472_3283/master/5472..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ef138f1b5bd7dbcc5f0470220420217","title":"ploughing through coronavirus news for the brighter stories","story":"The Upside succumbs to coronavirus positivity: silver linings, survivor stories and funny interludesLast week we began with a paradox.

It’s lots of outbreaks at different stages that all need to be tackled locally through local teams, and local action plans in each area so measures can be lifted over time.”Public Health England was contact tracing cases until 12 March, at which point 32 people had died after contracting coronavirus. Schools stayed open for another eight days and it was 11 days before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, on 23 March.In the face of growing criticism over the lack of testing for frontline health professionals and those with mild symptoms, Hancock announced a “five-pillar” plan last Thursday. He pledged to increase lab testing dramatically, introduce new antibody tests for people who may have had the virus, and conduct “surveillance testing” – checking samples of the population to model the extent of the virus’s spread.“We’ve lost nearly two months in getting on top of this epidemic,” Pollock said. “And that’s what the scandal is really.” She said there would be a second wave of infections, and planning needed to start now.“Clearly we don’t have the capacity to do contact tracing, but we can just call for volunteers, train them up to do it and combine that with mobile phone apps as in Singapore and South Korea and China.”Some UK public health professionals, however, believe it is too late for contact tracing because the virus has spread too far. And the example set by Singapore appears increasingly questionable: the country is to close most workplaces and all schools this week following the prime minister’s admission that “despite our good contact tracing” the authorities have been unable to ascertain the origin of nearly half its new cases.One senior director of public health, responsible for local health teams including contact tracing, dismissed the experts group as “armchair commentators”. “Contact tracing would be a waste of time right now,” said the director, who asked not to be named. “We should have done better on testing, but that’s being resolved. Contact tracing would tell you nothing because it’s so widespread. We have to focus on increasing testing, and most virologists I’ve spoken to would agree.“I suspect there will come a time for contract tracing again, but not now. It’s when you start getting outbreaks in care homes and prisons and hospitals, or possibly when we’re through the first or second peak and the numbers are bumping along the bottom.”Yet the calls for contact tracing to resume appear to be gathering steam. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has repeatedly called for testing and contact tracing.At the beginnng of last week, Pollock and three others published a paper in the British Medical Journal questioning why the government was not following WHO advice. Then last Wednesday, 24 public health experts, led by David McCoy, professor of global public health at Barts Medical School, signed an open letter urging the government “to expand community testing and inidual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation as a core disease control measure”.“Testing and quarantine are not enough on their own,” McCoy said, “especially if we want to avoid some of the serious harms that would be caused by prolonged lockdown. It is not clear why the government is resisting the evidence from elsewhere, as well as the views of the majority of public health opinion.”The group has since expanded to include more than 50 public health experts, Pollock said.AnneliesWilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “To anyone who tells me that contact tracing is too expensive or not do-able, I just say, rubbish. We are now basically quarantining 68 million people. That is so much more expensive. But at the moment, we cannot do contract tracing.”She said with the epidemic “out of hand”, the lockdown needs time to interrupt the virus’s transmission.“Then we can go back to the basics of dealing with this outbreak. You test, test, test, test. You find a case, you isolate the case you find their contacts and you isolate their contacts.”The Department for Health and Social Care did not respond to requests for comment, but some academics believe smartphone apps might provide automatic contact tracing.NHSX, a ision of the NHS responsible for digital innovation, is working on an app that would monitor other phones’ Bluetooth signals, keeping a record of those most at risk – possibly anyone who stayed within two metres for 15 minutes, the FT reported. If a user tested positive, they could upload a notification, which would warn people they needed to self-isolate.Yet the tracking technology would raise privacy concerns, and the system would not work efficiently unless tens of millions of people downloaded the app.“Mobile technology may be a useful adjunct, but contact tracing and the behaviour change we subsequently want to engender needs an active human element,” McCoy said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c8ed6c2209cc05db4d56ca67283b55a5005634b/0_3_3900_2340/master/3900..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb9338c345b693c9bfa0593d0cac85ae","title":"rural resort towns coronavirus covid 19 holiday","story":"Ski towns and luxury retreats report rising number of cases amid concern hospitals could be overwhelmed by coronavirus patientsAs the rich have rushed to escape to their luxury retreats, local officials are reporting a disproportionate rise in Covid-19 cases and getting increasingly angry and worried about cases overwhelming small local hospitals.In Ketchum, Idaho, the nearest city to the luxurious Sun Valley ski resort, Mayor Neil Bradshaw warned that the region was not the a place for a “virus vacation”.In last year’s ski season, Sun Valley had 426,500 skier days. For decades, it has been a hotspot for jet-setting celebrities and billionaires including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mark Zuckerberg, Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood. As of Thursday, there were 351 confirmed cases in its county, which is home to only 22,000 people.“We must discourage friends and visitors from coming to town,” Bradshaw wrote in a column for the Idaho Mountain Express. “For a town used to welcoming visitors, that is hard to do, but we must reduce the number of people visiting our area.”Sun Valley is in Blaine county, which is now host to nearly half the statewide total of cases. The outbreak there has overwhelmed the region’s only hospital, which has one ventilator and was partially shut down after several of its doctors were quarantined.What is happening in Idaho is reflective of a national trend. Rural counties with recreation economies show higher coronavirus infection rates, according to an analysis by the rural news site Daily Yonder, with rates that are more than three times higher than those of rural counties with other kinds of economies.An analysis in the Salt Lake Tribune showed that these areas had some of the highest cases per capita in the country, rivaled only by New York City and New Orleans.The two rural recreation counties with the most cases in late March were home to the popular ski resort spots Vail, Colorado. and Park City, Utah.A cluster of cases in Vail has now been tied to cases in Mexico, after 400 people, including business executives, took two chartered flights to visit the resort from Guadalajara. At least three high-profile executives tested positive after returning from Vail.In Park City, home to the Utah’s largest ski resort, city leaders urged people to stay away.The town, which helps draw more than 4 million skiers to Utah each year, was the first place in Utah to see community spread of coronavirus and has had an especially high concentration of cases.Park City is in Summit county and its health director, Rich Bullough, said the first case in the county was a visitor and said the region’s high rate of cases was “absolutely” related to tourism.New York City residents fleeing the coronavirus for upstate getaways and homes in the summer hotspots on Long Island are also angering residents. “Put the National Guard right at the damn Hudson River or other points, nobody crosses that line,” wrote one upstate New York commenter. “Think about our families too, STAY DOWN THERE.”The Hamptons, the glitzy seaside New York community where Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow and a host of Wall Street bankers have summer homes, has seen its population surge in the wake of the pandemic. The village of Southampton has seen its population soar in recent weeks from 60,000 to 100,000.Tourism spots in warmer climates have also seen coronavirus take a toll on the economy.Palm Beach county in Florida now has the highest death rate from Covid 19 in the state, 27 out of 144 deaths across the state so far. Palm Beach is home to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates, Tiger Woods, Jimmy Buffett and Rod Stewart are among its famous residents.Although it is too early to say why the spikes in cases occurred, the increase in visitors is likely to be a factor.Governor Ron DeSantis pinned the Florida cases on international visitors and initially planned to deploy Florida’s resources there, before issuing a statewide stay-at-home order on Wednesday.In Ketchum, Idaho, ER doctor Brent Russell said every day at work he used to see people traveling from Seattle, San Francisco and Washington DC.“Every week there’s people from those places,” Russell told the Idaho Statesman. “Most likely someone from an urban area or multiple people from urban areas came here and they just set it off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7e75518ba4ea3ff0fe0cb470bf19e3a118c391f/0_82_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf369fc1c234be5c5da5123069785693","title":"sharp rise recorded for coronavirus cases in some uk regions","story":"London had seen a slight drop in the rate of admissions, while the rate in Wales remained “steady”, he added.It comes as the total number of recorded coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals rose by 708 to 4,313 as of 5pm on Friday – the steepest rise since the outbreak began.Stephen Powis, England’s chief medical director, said it “was not unexpected” to see geographic variations in the spread of a the epidemic.“I think it’s difficult to give an explanation as to why any particular part of country has a higher rate at any one time. I would say that, not unsurprisingly, London, as a major urban centre, has an infection rate that is a week or so ahead of the rest of the country.“If you look at the normal winter and look at the spread of flu in a normal winter, it’s not unusual to see flu rates in the winter pop up in one area of the country before they rise up in other areas of the country.”The news follows reports on Friday that hospitals in the West Midlands could reach maximum capacity by next weekend, with the region’s mayor Andy Street saying it was set to become the UK’s next hotspot.Gove would not be drawn on the government’s “exit strategy” for the crisis, stating that “there’s no fixed point, no specific date in the calendar at which we can say things will change, we are keeping them under review”. Boris Johnson is set to review the lockdown measures currently in place on 13 April.Earlier on Saturday the government’s key adviser, Prof Graham Medley, warned that a prolonged lockdown risked causing more harm than good and that Britain had “painted itself into a wall” with no clear exit strategy.During the briefing, Powis said: “I don’t like the term exit strategy. It is very likely that this virus will become established in populations throughout the world and so we need a strategy to manage this over time, not just in the next few weeks or the next few months.” He said the current strategy was to “save lives and protect the NHS”.Gove thanked China for sending 300 ventilators to the UK, and said hundreds more were being manufactured in the UK every day.A team from University College London working with Mercedes-Benz has produced a new non-invasive respirator that has been clinically approved. Gove said the machines would be vital in reducing the number of patients who would eventually need to be intubated.“They produced 250 yesterday, they will produce the same number today and tomorrow, rising to 1,000 a day next week,” he said.“We are also increasing the capacity of the NHS to deploy invasive ventilation. We have been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad including Germany and Switzerland. And today 300 new ventilators arrived from China.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8de8c272a9be04a319822ab10592c12352b2320/0_142_4000_2400/master/4000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f341dca31f6df90e334f1a6de54fd98b","title":"sunak emergency covid 19 loan what do companies think","story":"The chancellor’s original scheme worried employers. So how has the revamped plan gone down?Newmarket HolidaysMarc Vincent, finance director of Newmarket Holidays, says the firm sells 80,000 holidays a year and around a third are sold online. Now he is deluged by customer inquiries. That has meant he cannot furlough staff: it’s all hands to the pumps.“If tour operators are allowed to go under, it will be like a run on a bank, with a long chain of suppliers also affected,” he said. “And then the government will need to bail out customers anyway, so much better to do it now.”To benefit from a VAT holiday until the summer, staff have spent the last week delving through payments, though he says the savings are limited.Regulations that give customers the right to demand their money back on package holidays within 14 days of cancellation should be changed, he says. Instead, travel firms should be allowed to offer credit notes that can be redeemed after two years if they are not spent. “Other EU countries are doing this and so should we.”Chairman and chief executive Antony Sheriff was disappointed with Sunak’s first effort at a loan scheme for medium-sized companies like his when it insisted they must access commercial loans – a costly and cumbersome procedure. The reforms mean the company will now examine them favourably. “I think he has done a good job,” says Sheriff.The 55-year-old company has cash in the bank and could withstand several months of a lockdown, he says, but he is concerned about the costs of starting up again in the summer or autumn, which could mean outlays for materials would be prohibitively expensive.“We make everything on our boats, from the hull to the furniture. It all happens here. We account for about 15,000 jobs in the Plymouth area and the ease of getting back into production is key,” he says.Any thought of profits this year have evaporated. “Everybody will look back at 2020 and say what a shame, but I hope not too many people will focus on the financials in a year that is pretty much a write-off,” he says. Newcastle UniversityThere are officials inside the Treasury who consider universities the linchpin and economic driving force of many towns and cities in Britain. Huge employers, they are also tied into the local economy through relationships with businesses and state agencies, including the NHS.Some staff on fixed-term contracts have had their status paused, he says, while the university looks to place them in other roles. But his main concern is bridging the likely two-to-three-year gap before foreign student numbers return to current levels. “We don’t have the resources to keep research going with financial help from our funders. We don’t get the full economic cost of research paid for other than by cross-subsidy from foreign student income. It has always been an unstable situation that the pandemic forces us to address,” he says. Fred Olsen“I have been talking to our management team about government funding and how the travel industry has reacted passively while airline businesses like Virgin Atlantic have said a subsidy is desperately needed,” says Peter Deer, managing director of Fred Olsen Cruise Lines.Virgin has called on the government to give the industry up to £7.5bn in state support. The chancellor rebuffed the call, saying he would only consider support on a case-by-case basis. Despite this setback, Deer thinks the travel industry should be making more noise.The company, which has a turnover of £200m-£250m, has four ships laying up in the Firth of Forth and a fifth, the Braemar, about to leave Southampton to join them. About 300 of the firm’s 500 staff in Ipswich are home-working while they deal with customer inquiries, many of them about lost bookings. The rest are at home not working.“We are using the furlough scheme, and that is great, but there are many other costs we face,” he says, adding that the government should be working harder to prevent the industry shrinking.“The drop in cruise-ship business has come as a huge shock to our suppliers, the majority of which are in the UK. There are 40,000 people in the industry and they are being completely overlooked.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest 5 april at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally has passed 1.2m, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these is in the US, which has 311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases are as follows: US (311,544), Spain (126,168), Italy (124,632), Germany (96,092), France (90,848). China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased. It also reported 47 new asymptomatic cases.Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans would see “a lot of death”. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration’s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps “fake news”. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success. The drug repeatedly pushed by Trump, hydroxychloroquine, has only shown anecdotal promise.With deaths from Covid-19 cases in New York topping 3,000, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced he had received help from China for ventilator supplies. “We’re not yet at the apex,” said Cuomo, who described the crescendo of cases to come as “the number one point of engagement of the enemy”. Cuomo said he had obtained 1,000 ventilators from the Chinese government with the help of billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and the Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Oregon had loaned New York another 140, he said. Donald Trump tried to claim credit for the 1,000 ventilators, saying “two very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators”.New Zealand passes Coronavirus cases in New Zealand have passed the 1,000 mark, with health officials reporting 89 new cases on Sunday. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern praised those who had complied with the country’s strict lockdown but said there were “still some people I would charitably describe as idiots”, citing a man in Christchurch who filmed himself coughing on people. The country has now recorded 1,039 confirmed cases, with one death. The number of confirmed cases in Spain has swollen to 124,870 , passing Italy’s 124,632 and making it the country with the second highest number of cases in the world, behind the US. Italy’s death toll is still the world’s worst, however, and it passed the grim milestone of 15,000 on Saturday.Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation’s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported “home” Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22902799e5f6b49e9bf3a92855305f6b22fc2ca2/0_447_6609_3964/master/6609..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cedbdd624cb6473c72ab5f6b90da58b0","title":"food heroes who reach out to the isolated vulnerable and hungry","story":"From chefs to lawyers to jewellery-makers, an army of volunteers has stepped up to help keep the nation fedIn the week since the NHS identified more than 1.5 million people who are most vulnerable and in need of support, the government has issued about 30,000 food parcels containing tinned vegetables, bread, tuna and fresh fruit. The number is expected to increase to “hundreds of thousands being delivered every week” according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but action has been much quicker on the ground. We speak to some of the heroes in the drive to keep the nation fed.SloughIn a little under three weeks, Ajmal Azam has helped support about 300 people in his local community by organising a network of food parcels, shopping and hot meals for those most in need. In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor. Now he spends six hours a day packing and delivering boxes of tinned goods, pulses, bread, fruit and veg. It’s humbling, he admits, but crucial work.Azam drew up a roster of volunteers, and has been working alongside Sikhs in Slough, who are also operating a mobile food-support network for those who are over 65 and quarantined. “We called up Wexham, our local hospital, to ask what they needed, and a senior A\u0026ampE sister pointed out that a number of nurses are in self-isolation and struggling to get basic necessities – so we put together 100 packages that day.”While Azam has spent “probably more than £1,000” getting supplies together, he is keen to credit local grocers, supermarkets and takeaways that have been providing food and essentials. “Everyone wants to help. That’s incredible. My phone hasn’t stopped ringing since we put the first flyer out on social media. I do feel drained and exhausted at this stage but the impact we’ve had is so endearing. I’ve had so many messages from people that it’s making a difference to. That’s keeping me going.”LondonChef Michey Chan is used to cooking up a storm. In his day job, heading up the staff kitchen at the Dorchester, he prepares an average of 900 meals for the lunch and dinner service. At Manorfield primary school in east London, where he is now feeding the children of key workers and teaching staff, the brief is a touch less intense but arguably a lot more satisfying.“The kids have really good palates,” says Chan. “They don’t have bad eating habits and they’re adventurous about trying a lot of things. Sometimes we have to bribe them with cookies but they try everything.”It has been two weeks since the Dorchester team took up residency in the school canteen, in an area that headteacher Paul Jackson describes as “incredibly deprived”. Over half the school is entitled to free school meals, and 72 pupils are on the child protection register. At the moment, anywhere between 12 and 20 children are coming in every day, with Manorfield operating as a hub for neighbouring schools.With help from the Dorchester and the local authority, Jackson is now working on a scheme to get hot meals and food parcels delivered to vulnerable local families throughout the Easter holidays: “It’s a way for us to feel useful – you don’t notice the stress of everything until you’re out of here. One thing is certain: even when things change, school meals here will never be the same again. The standards have been changed for ever.”GlasgowIt began, as lockdown ideas now often do, over Whatsapp. Disheartened by the gloom shrouding Glasgow, jewellery maker Freya Alder got chatting to her friends – illustrator Isabella Burnell and textile designer Ruth Mitchell – about ways to lift the collective mood. The three launched the Maker’s Raffle two weeks ago with pieces donated by a dozen Scottish ceramicists, potters, textile designers and printmakers, hoping to match the £1,500 Alder had raised in December for Glasgow South East Foodbank.“After the general election, I felt a huge sense of doom and powerlessness. Going to the Co-op the morning after and putting some stuff in the food bank made me feel infinitely better, which is where the idea was born,” says Alder. The response this time round, however, has floored her.“I did a little callout but people have been amazing. Our businesses are small and they’ve been hit hard but we know other vulnerable people are struggling.”Despite a significant loss of income for many of the one-person businesses trying to weather the current crisis, Alder reports that “it’s made us all feel better, I think that’s why it’s been so successful. Makers are uncomfortable trying to sell their wares when they know people are stretched thin, but this is a tiny little gesture anyone can join in.”Tickets are £2. Alder’s hope is that communities in other cities will copy the model to support food banks, which are desperate for donations nationwide. “Every city has a creative scene, and if every city did one of these it could make so much money for people who need it most,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2a1b547434fd26f2d60d636d1e2272e6fb42d6/0_61_1800_1080/master/1800..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebfd7fe8930f1a19532720569d2b4da6","title":"germanys devolved logic is helping it win the coronavirus race","story":"With 400 public health offices forging ahead with testing, the country is a model for others to emulateAs the coronavirus crisis tests the resilience of democracies around the globe, Germany has gone from cursing its lead-footed, decentralised political system to wondering if federalism’s tortoise versus hare logic puts it in a better position to brave the pandemic than most.Under German federalism – which has roots going back to the Holy Roman Empire but was entrenched after the Nazi era to weaken centralised rule – key policy areas, such as health, education and cultural affairs, fall under the jurisdiction of the country’s 16 states, or Länder.At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, such a highly devolved system of governance made the woman nominally in charge of the country look oddly powerless: even when Angela Merkel announced the first raft of social-distancing measures, she could only make recommendations that the federal states were free to implement or ignore.As social-distancing measures came into effect, there were howls of frustration over how wildly the lockdowns varied between the states: in Berlin, for example, buying a book from a shop is still allowed but having a picnic in the park is not. In Baden-Württemberg, it’s the other way around.Federalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync.States in the formerly socialist east, less severely hit by the virus, were reluctant to close their schools, drawing ire from southern states who feared their students would then be put at a disadvantage.A week and a half into the de facto lockdown, however, Germany is beginning to discover the upsides of a system which distributes, rather than centralises, power.The country suddenly finds itself being held up as the model to be emulated for its high rates of testing – seen by many as the only strategy for being able to navigate a route out of lockdown measures.German public health services are provided not by one central authority but by approximately 400 public health offices, run by municipality and rural district administrations.Such an environment allows for a variety of laboratories – some attached to universities or hospitals, others privately run, medium-sized businesses – which act largely autonomously of central control.“I don’t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test,” said Matthias Orth, of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Stuttgart’s Marienhospital.Some private labs started offering tests for the Covid-19 virus long before statutory health insurers were offering to pay for the tests, giving Germany a head start. Now around 250 laboratories are carrying out between 300,000 and 500,000 tests for Covid-19 every week.Not bad for a lead-footed tortoise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2bf0618816aa04f38badf31aeb7c79e856a142/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539941900cfe3cbbf3e61d23dd407078","title":"new zealand passes 1000 coronavirus cases as pm chastises idiots ignoring lockdown","story":"Jacinda Ardern says lockdown may have prevented thousands of cases but calls for even better complianceCoronavirus cases in New Zealand have passed the 1,000 mark, with health officials reporting 89 new cases on Sunday.The country, which has been in lockdown since 25 March, has now recorded 1,039 confirmed cases, with one death. There are 15 people in hospital with Covid-19, including three in intensive care.While Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that there were indications the lockdown, scheduled to last four weeks, was having an effect in slowing infections, authorities have issued new guidance that separates families and lovers who don’t live together.Self-isolation principles were previously vague, with the prime minister asking New Zealanders to “apply common sense” and shrink down their social group to “a small group of iniduals who are part of your bubble ... the bubble you must maintain” for the month.That was understood largely to mean households, but the non-specific language allowed families and partners who didn’t live together to see each other. However, the issuing of a Health Act Order replaced the unspecific order with explicit language and left no room for misinterpretation.The order allows for no fraternising across households with very limited exemptions for shared custody of children, and when at least one of the partners lives alone. The end result is the criminalisation of most relationships between Kiwis who don’t live together.New Zealand police have been contacted for comment on how they intend to enforce the ban.At a briefing on Sunday afternoon, Ardern praised those who had complied with the lockdown but said there were “still some people I would charitably describe as idiots”, citing a man in Christchurch who filmed himself coughing on people.Ardern said no decisions had been made about extending the country’s four-week lockdown, but there were signs that it was having an effect.Modelling had suggested that without the restrictions the country would have seen 4,000 cases by this weekend, instead of the 1,000 it had actually recorded, Ardern said. And while she didn’t want to “draw too many conclusions”, New Zealand had not seen the exponential growth experienced by other countries.“Going hard and going early appears to be paying off for us,” she said.Over Friday and Saturday, Ardern said police had carried out 795 prevention patrols and 990 reassurance checks at essential services.By closing borders 25 days after the first case, New Zealand had acted much quicker than other countries, she said, and the government’s first economic rescue package was similarly swift. Witnessing the trajectories overseas had helped the government to decide to “go hard and go early”, Ardern said.AAP contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Speaking to Sky New’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Rayner said the government’s was failing on testing, and on protecting frontline NHS staff.Former health secretary Alan Johnson has condemned the government’s response to Covid-19.The former Labour MP told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “I am absolutely amazed at how badly prepared the government is for this.”He added that during his tenure as health secretary, in which the swine flu pandemic took place in 2009, the government had a risk register. “Top of our risk register was a pandemic,” he said, saying that second on the list was a terror attack. He added that the basic arrangements that government’s should be prepared for in the event of a pandemic was protective equipment for NHS staff, alongside testing. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of The Doctors’ Association UK, has raised concerns about the “severe lack” of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline NHS workers.He told Sky News that some doctors had told the association that they were having to reuse single-use surgical masks, while others were holding their breath during procedures on coronavirus patients because they didn’t know if their equipment would offer enough protection.He added that some doctors, many of whom did not have symptoms in line with Covid-19 but who lived with people who did, had been sent to a NHS testing centre only to be told their name doesn’t appear on a list and they couldn’t be tested.The prime minister Boris Johnson is in “good spirits” but still has a temperature over a week after he was diagnosed with Covid-19, according to Hancock.“The prime minister is working away inside downing street but he’s making sure he protects others by following public health advice,” he added.Hancock, who also contracted the virus, said he did not know if Johnson had been visited by doctors at Downing Street.Health secretary Matt Hancock is first up on Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning, emphasising that people should not flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather. “Sunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,” he said, adding that it was “unbelievable frankly to see some people are not following that advice”.“I say this to the very small minority of people who are choosing to flout the guidance you are putting other’s lives at risk and you are putting yourself in harm’s way.”He added that the “vast majority of the public” were following guidance to stay at home unless they are going to buy essentials such as food or medicine, seeking medical care, going to work, or exercising.Hancock’s call for the public to adhere to public health guidance comes as Lambeth Council closed Brockwell Park in south-west London on Saturday, after it claimed that more than 3,000 people had spent the day in the park, sunbathing or hanging out in large groups.I’m Amy Walker, covering the liveblog for the next two hours, you can follow me on Twitter at @amyrwalker.Good morning, and welcome to Sunday’s UK-focused coronavirus live blog.

Illustration: Michael VineyThe song thrush joins me half an hour before dawn, perching on the bare, topmost branch of the hawthorn outside my workroom window.He sings steadily, facing the sea, the top notes a bit muffled by the double glazing, while I bring up the papers on desktop to see how much worse things have got.As the sky lightens and goldfinches start squabbling at the nuts, the slope of fields sharpens to the sea. Electricity poles march away between the sheep, their rain-rinsed fleeces echoed in the white line of surf beyond the dunes.To look at such distances is a luxury. Even a pallid, featureless ocean, its islands blurred in drizzle, is calming to the mind. And on the acre itself, so raw late into leaf, the primroses shine.“If you’ve got enough land to grow potatoes for a year, there’s nothing they can do to you really.” I wrote that when I was still in my 40s and fresh to the challenge of “alternative” rural living.Still here at 87 and somewhat slowed down by respiratory ills from a chain-smoking youth, I am blessed with a partner who, down on the floor for her morning exercises, insists on staying fit and able at 91. We share a privileged isolation, separately glued to broadband to follow the news and to carry our chronicles of the natural world.Most of the acre that grew a year’s potatoes is now shaded with trees or tangled with a dense scrub of fuchsia and briars. All this shelters a polytunnel with a ridge of early potatoes, the first instalment of a quite re-energised urge to get things growing.Wooden arkI ventured past the tunnel in bright sunshine, armoured with prickle-proof welder’s gauntlets and the secateurs. The path leads on into the trees, but briars have arched their grapnels from the hedge bank to root at the other side.These severed and yanked up, I pressed on to find, immured in shadows and brambles, the wooden ark I made for the hens in the days when I still could do anything. Disdained now even by owls or bats, its marine plywood stood darkly intact. Its intricate carpentry (six nest boxes, recycled windows, a sliding droppings tray) had put me at a pinnacle of DIY achievement, as if I had built a boat.The ark had housed Rhode Island Red Light Sussex crosses, all of them brightly aware and fluffily warm to stir off their eggs: I still know the feel of their feathers.The first dozen were renewed after the inevitable fox, discovering the door still open at dusk, compulsively slew them all and carried some to cache in a hole up the hill. And the ducks, while I’m at it, were finally abandoned after visits by stoat and otter, and from my own dismay at having to “cull” the ducklings at 10 weeks, taffeta-crisp and pristine.What took me back to the old henhouse was learning that, supermarkets emptied of eggs, Britons were seeking hens for their back gardens – such a bonanza for the UK’s urban foxes.Our own eggs now come from SuperValu, commendably delivering from Westport, 35km away. Thus, long after years of a hectic self-reliance, through bees, goats, geese and fish from a spillet, we share the same grateful online dependency as the harried world beyond the hill.The polytunnel is a treasured remnant of endeavour, like the seedlings on my warm workroom window-sill: peas, lettuce, courgettes, beetroot, cavalo nero kale. Tomatoes, sown far too soon, are planted in the tunnel, stoically surviving under fleece the chilly nights of spring.Garden gossipThis is garden gossip to encourage citizens who are putting their daily exercise into skinning the lawn for instant raised vegetable beds (Quickcrop delivers them) or, starting from scratch, sowing online seeds at just the right time.And after it all ends, whenever that is, what shape will things be in?Back in the 1970s, “organic” was still a hippy word, like “self-sufficiency” and “saving nature”. All that flowed into the new recognition of ecology.The early intellectual drive came mainly from the US, from disciples of “deep ecology” and “Earth First!” That was reinforced by Lovelock’s theory of Gaia, the Earth as self-managing organism, and the mounting crisis of climate change.Still passionate in defence of closer bonds with nature, its threads vibrate, for example, through the online journal Ecological Citizen, offering papers on “eco-anarchism” or a “Nietzschean land ethic”.Since the 1970s the lure of a little land on which to try out new personal skills has taken many away from the city, repelled by corporate culture and consumerism. The social and economic turmoil of Covid-19 and its aftermath may well see a resurgence of inidual and communal withdrawal from outworn and growth-driven forms of capitalism."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

It’s a very rapid progression of disease of some people, especially the elderly and immunocompromised, and that’s scary. This is something that none of us clinicians have ever seen before.”The scope of the epidemic in Ireland was being “misrepresented” by a reliance on figures based on limited testing, Dr Lambert said.“How can you talk about flattening the curve where you’re testing such small numbers of people and people are queuing up to get testing?”“And then there’s results that are pending for a week, so the numbers represent our lack of supplies for testing rather than flattening the curve.”Significant exposureUpscaling of testing was urgently needed in order to flatten the curve, he said. “And then as soon as those test results are available, which should be in 24 hours, you contact trace everyone who has had a significant exposure.”“South Korea and Singapore and many of the other countries have been able to flatten the curve didn’t do it just by putting people in isolation and reporting numbers. They did it by testing and very strict contact tracing. That’s what we need to be doing.”Dr Lambert said a “master plan” was needed in order to “win the war” on coronavirus.“You can’t fight one battle more than another battle. You have to have a master plan and fight all of the battles in parallel. The testing plan. The shutdown plan. The contact tracing plan. The community plan, as so on.”Dr Lambert said that while Ireland is “way ahead” of other European countries, and “ahead of the game” in some respects, actions in some situations were being taken “a day too late”.“If you don’t scale up (testing) you’ll just have to shut down and shut down and shut down.”Meanwhile, emergency medicine consultants believe the expected surge in critically infected patients requiring places in ICU could hit Irish hospitals swiftly based on the experiences of hospitals in London and Italy.“It can happen very quickly,” said University Hospital Limerick intensive care physician Dr Catherine Motherway, who is president of the Intensive Care Society.She said the experience in Italy was of cases coming “like a wave”.“It was like nothing they had ever seen before. That’s how quickly a surge can happen,” said Dr Motherway, though she added that medics in Italy did not know Covid-19 was in the community for some time. “They saw a few patients with respiratory failure and then a few more and then it happened and it happened very quickly.”AmbulanceDr Motherway said one Dublin hospital, running at twice its normal capacity, experienced a surge in critically ill patients requiring ICU beds earlier this week, but managed the surge by transferring affected patients elsewhere by ambulance. She said this scenario had been managed “very appropriately and we are still in a place where we can do that”.Dr Emily O’Conor, president of the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, said that ICU beds would fill up quickly when the Covid-19 surge hits the health system.“When a hospital experiences a surge, it is inclined to happen very quickly it is a patient suffering respiratory failure followed by another followed by another,” said Dr O’Connor, an emergency medicine consultant at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, Dublin.“It is trying to pace the curve and reduce the amount of people who get sick. We are hoping that it is not happening very quickly. We are still planning for those scenarios.”Dr O’Connor said that Letterkenny Hospital in Co Donegal “went through a difficult period” at one point and that Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and Limerick “have been under significant pressure on their ICU capacity”.Inter-hospital transfers would help ease pressure, she said.“That is still happening. It is as the capacity gets full that it is going to be more difficult,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4220018.1585919730!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus q a how to shop safely during covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman carries shopping bags in Dublin city centre as the Covid-19 pandemic takes hold. Photograph: Aidan CrawleyEPA.I have to wash my shopping now, do I?As the scale of the coronavirus crisis has deepened at home and abroad restrictions on daily life have become more intense. One of the few places people can now go is their supermarket. But people have been advised to go much less frequently than in the past. There has been much more focus on just how safe these places are and there are controls on how many people can enter shops to allow for social distancing. Measures are also being taken to sanitise them more deeply.That’s all good then?Yes, it is. But is it enough? Several days ago, a video appeared on YouTube from a US doctor in which he showed people how to decontaminate their shopping. Dr Jeffrey J Vanwingen asked people to imagine their groceries were covered in glitter - except the glitter is coronavirus. Dr Vanwingen then methodically cleaned his shopping in a video that ran to more than seven minutes. Within days it had been watched by more than 20 million people.Is what he was saying true? The “disregard of hygiene standards” in some shops was highlighted by the Irish Global Health Network (IGHN). “We know that the virus can survive on hard surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours,” one of its environmental health specialists Niall Roche said. “It can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours. Supermarkets should adhere to the same guidance and practices that are being exercised in healthcare facilities, particularly for vulnerable shoppers.” Was there more? There was. The IGHN, in partnership with the Environmental Health Association of Ireland and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health in the UK released a set of guidelines for shoppers which they hoped would help slow the spread of Covid-19.These guidelines set out a number of protocols to help the public protect themselves while at the shops. They advised people to use their non-dominant hand to pick up goods to reduce the cross-contamination risk from touching of the mouth, nose or eyes and said contactless payments should be made where possible.The guidelines also said that because the virus can live on surfaces - shopping trolleys, baskets, pin pads, and other regularly touched items - they should be sanitised after each use.Yes. People were advised to reduce the frequency of shopping trips and only go when absolutely necessary and should avoid taking children to shops if possible and visit off-peak. They were encouraged to assess the infection control measures in local shops. How could they do that?Among the measures the groups said people should look out for were controls of the entry and exit of customers, the cleaning and sanitising of trolleys and baskets between use and the provision of hand sanitisers at entrances . The guidelines said best practise mandated there should be clear marking on floors to help customers maintain social distance and messages via posters and public address systems reminding customers and staff to maintain social distance.Staff should also be practising social distancing on the shop floor and cleaning critical contact areas. The group also said baked goods should be covered to protect from sneezes and coughs. So far so sensible. What else? Consumers were advised to wash their hands immediately after returning home and take great care when packing goods away. Prior to stocking fridges and cupboards, shelves should be wiped with sanitiser and a paper towels and as coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces, the outside of all cannedhard surface pack goods should be wiped with a paper towel and warm soapy water,An alternate option would be to leave non-perishable foods in a safe place for 72 hours. Remove outer food packaging and discard, being careful to limit handling of the inner packaging of items such as yoghurts.Is that extreme? Do I really need to wash all my shopping?Well, associate professor of virology at Trinity College Kim Roberts is unconvinced. She is one of Ireland’s leading microbiologists and says the risk of bringing coronavirus into your home on your shopping is low. She says the more serious risks are associated with actually travelling to the shops - particularly on public transport and in touching high-touch surfaces in shops such as doors, trollies, freezer handles and the rest. She says the chances that a particular box of cereal or tin that you touch will have been sneezed on directly and will have, as a result a sufficiently high level of the virus to transmit it to the person who touches it next are very low.Does that mean transmission that way is impossible?No, it is possible. But she says it is important to assess and manage risk in this crisis. Does Dr Roberts wash her shopping? No, she does not. Is there any other advice out there?There is indeed. “Currently, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging,” says Ireland’s food safety watchdog Safefood. It adds that now - as ever - it is important to follow good hygiene practices when handling or preparing foods. Does Safefood have specific coronavirus advice? It does. When you go food shopping, you should wash your hands before you leave the house, avoid touching your face when you’re out and follow social distancing. When you come home, you should wash your hands straight away. Wash them again once you have unpacked and put away your shopping.It says it is not necessary to sanitise the outside of food packaging. “While there is some evidence that the virus can survive on hard surfaces, the risk from handling food packing is very low and there is no evidence that the illness can be transmitted in this way,” is its advice. So should I put my food into quarantine?Not according to Safefood. “You should always put away your shopping as soon as you get home, especially perishable foods which must be stored in the fridge or freezer.” On this point the authority was in agreement with Dr Vanwingen who felt compelled to release a sequel to his first video reminding people of this fact. What else do I need to know? Oh, yes, should I wear gloves when shopping?Here’s the thing. A healthcare professional in a healthcare setting has to wear gloves to protect themselves and to protect patients. And the gloves can make a huge difference. But the jury is out when it comes to the general public using them to buy their groceries. Coronavirus can not penetrate your skin and you will not get it if is on your skin. It has to enter your body through the nose, mouth or eyes. If you wear gloves and are careful not to touch your face while wearing them and remove them carefully and dispose of them carefully as soon as you have moved away from the high risk high touch areas, then they may be okay. But if you allow the gloves to give you a false sense of security and are careless with them, they could actually be doing more harm than good.What about face masks?If this question had been asked of us two weeks ago we would have said a definitive no as all the official guidance, in Ireland and internationally, was saying masks were of limited benefit away from specialised health settings and could even be counterproductive when handled by people who don’t know what they are doing. And let’s face it that is all of us who are not working in healthcare. Yet, given the lack of definitive knowledge about how coronavirus is spread, many experts now argue that something is better than nothing, and masks may play a role, alongside social distancing and hand hygiene.Right now the World Health Organisation and US regulators are mulling a change of their guidelines in relation to masks. Countries such as Austria and the Czech Republic have made the wearing of masks compulsory in public - notably in shops. Countries in Asia where mask-wearing is common say it has helped to stem the spread.Should I stop using recycled shopping bags?There are some schools of thought that suggest bags for life should not be used in this time of extreme crisis. But the reality is that the bags in your home are probably less exposed to the virus than the bags in the shop. The act of bringing them to the shop does not make them more dangerous. You could safely disinfect bags for life before and after use or if they are fabric you could wash them at 60 degrees but that would be more for peace of mind than anything else.What about when it comes to paying, should I pay in cash?No. Ideally you want to limit all physical interactions with other people. The best way to pay is by tapping and using a contactless debit or credit card. This has limits - contactless can only be used up to a maximum of €50 in some stores although the limit is €30 in Tesco. Apple and android pay can sometimes be used for larger sums although many people don’t have that facility - Bank of Ireland, for example, has still not rolled it out to its customers. After that the next option is chip and pin. And then cash. It is incredibly important that no matter what mode you use to pay you keep washing your hands but it is even more important you wash or sanitise your hands if using keypads or handling cash.Should I avoid using a trolley?It is hard to do a weekly shop - and it is very important that you reduce the number of trips to the supermarket - without a trolly. Ideally supermarket staff will be cleaning the trollies regularly. But if they are not you should, where possible, sanitise them yourself and then wash your hands as soon as you can. And do not touch your face. We have said it before and will say it again. The virus cannot enter your system through your skin so if you keep your hands away from your face and keep them clean you are helping to keep yourself safe.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: PM warns world leaders over protectionism after Trump is accused of face mask \u0026#39piracy\u0026#39Comment: From the EU to the USA, this economic collapse threatens the entire world orderWhen will coronavirus peak in the UK?  When will the UK lockdown end?

some of the high-profile ones - there is no factory that exists on the planet that makes these vaccines, they know that. “You can build a factory quickly but if you can’t make a wooden stick with a piece of cotton on the end, how on earth are you going to make something like a vaccine?”The British pharmaceutical has tried to offset these risks by making arrangements with facilities despite not knowing which vaccine will yet prove to be successful, the ABPI said. Dr Torbett said he was “optimistic” that Britain would manage to roll-out a form of treatment without encountering the kind of difficulties which have beset the testing process. He claimed it was incumbent on companies to try to “place your bets at the right time”, as more than 40 types of treatment were currently going through clinical trials in the European Medicines Agency.“I’ve seen many company that are going at risk, now, a long time before they’ve even gone to licence, to essentially ramp up manufacturing capacity, repurpose existing facilities - all of that is at risk because we don’t know whether it is going to work or not - to stand us in the best possible chance,” he told the . “There is an interesting trade-off between being well-prepared in the UK to being locked in the wrong technology at the wrong time.“I think there is a huge appetite to probably place higher risk bets right now than anyone would normally do in normal circumstances, certainly the companies are doing that and I think the Government is doing that as well.” The global race to find a vaccine for Covid-19 has already been influenced by the fallout from the swine flu pandemic, when Australia developed a jab but treated its own citizens first. Reports in the US have suggested that subsequent paranoia partly guided Donald Trump’s reported bid to secure exclusive rights to a vaccine developed by Germany company CureVac.Dr Torbett sought to play down speculation that this could impact the UK, saying: “I don’t think the UK will be at the back of the queue, if I can put it that way, at all. “I think alongside what companies can do, it is also very important while we are developing vaccines that the UK is a voice for global cooperation and a global approach to this challenge.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/11/01/TELEMMGLPICT000145320425_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"do not fooled keir starmer no centrist","story":"While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union, Starmer waged his own ideological battle to stop BrexitAside from Jeremy Corbyn, there can be no other Labour politician who bears more responsibility for the party’s crushing defeat at the last election than Sir Keir Starmer. While Corbyn spouted the politics of the student union and opened the door to toxic extremism, Starmer was waging his own ideological battle – to stop Brexit.As shadow Brexit secretary, he offered sincere assurances that Labour would respect the referendum result. But, as director of communications at No 10, I saw first-hand how Labour’s new leader sought to block our departure from the EU. I sat in on many of the cross-party Brexit talks and witnessed how he would frustrate any progress with endless objections. This reached farcical levels on one occasion when he branded the language of one government document as totally unacceptable, only to be told the text had been cut and pasted from a Labour paper.Ultimately the public was not fooled, either by the “lawyer’s Brexit” that Starmer offered up or by public assurances that Labour would respect the referendum. He now has a mountain to climb when it comes to reconnecting with voters. How he approaches the terrible Covid-19 pandemic will be a major test of whether he can win back their trust.If ever there was a time to transcend the boundaries of political tribalism, it is now. The Prime Minister yesterday wrote to party leaders urging them to “work together” with the Government. But will Starmer be able to resist playing politics with this pandemic? My guess is not. In his acceptance speech, he insisted he would work with the Government but would “challenge” and “call out” ministers if necessary. He went on to lay out a key battle line that will emerge when Britain breaks free from the pandemic – public sector pay.It seems, as with Brexit, that Starmer will insist he is putting politics to one side, while in reality indulging in the same old point-scoring. This political profiteering will only serve to ide when we should all unite. We are all on the same side in this war and Starmer would be wise to avoid going down this route. Daily press conferences mean the public have access to Government information as never before.They can judge for themselves whether ministers are doing everything possible. These ministers will rightly be held to account over the roll-out of testing – as they have been over protective equipment, intensive care beds and ventilators – but only those blinded by ideology would doubt their determination to beat this virus.I fear Starmer may be no more capable of breaking free from his own form of political tribalism than Corbyn was. He is not from the hard Left of the party like his predecessor – but he’s no centrist either. He is a true believer in the ideology of woke. As a human rights lawyer, he has dedicated his career to pursuing radical change in society through the courts, and being well paid for it. He represented poll tax rioters and striking print workers at Wapping. He helped eco-warriors in their bid to physically block road-widening schemes and often worked against the police.He is fully signed up to the articles of faith of the London metropolitan elite: supportive of open-door immigration, fiercely anti-Brexit, suspicious of patriotism and desperate to blame society rather than criminals for crime. The reason Labour lost dozens of seats in the North and Midlands was that traditional Labour voters realised the party was distant from their concerns and beliefs. Worse, it had contempt for them.So yes, Starmer will bring order to the grotesque chaos of today’s Labour Party, he will make his arguments in a reasonable tone and he will get a hearing. But in the end he is too immersed in the gospel of the progressive elite to be able to reach out to the communities abandoned by Labour. Above all, he won’t do the crucial thing that all successful leaders of the opposition do: he won’t challenge his party activists to look at themselves in the mirror and ask why the public rejected them.The Labour leadership election lasted for months, but not once did its eventual victor challenge the prejudices of Labour members. Political parties win elections by moving out of their ideological comfort zones and standing firmly in the mainstream, where the general public is. That’s why Keir Starmer is not the answer to Labour’s problems.Sir Robbie Gibb is a senior adviser at Kekst CNC and a former director of communications at 10 Downing StreetThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

A long lockdown will wipe out large swathes of the economy.  There will be a negative impact both financially and mentally on too many people.It is important to make plans now for when and why the lockdown will end. There are significant trade-offs in these key decisions. In a new research paper we have outlined how to end the lockdown in a phased and gradual way.The mathematical models of epidemiology currently occupy centre-stage in policymaking. To be absolutely clear, these models have real scientific value and have had a  positive impact on policy making. These models have strengths but they also have limitations, and it is the latter that threatens the lockdown being prolonged too far. Assumptions have to be made about the key inputs – the parameters – of any particular model. In physics, for instance, the parameters of physical laws are both fixed and are known with certainty.  The same is not true of epidemiological models.If people revert very quickly to the patterns of behaviour of before the crisis, the epidemiological models are correct.  There would be a second wave of infections.But behaviour will be different, either because of the lessons people have learned during this crisis, or because of the constraints placed upon them by rules and regulations. How many people will shake hands the day after the lockdown is lifted?Incentives matter. This is a key point that comes to the fore in economics. It is a point that may be overlooked if we rely purely on the arguments of epidemiologists to prolong the lockdown.It is important that we appreciate the choice we have to make on ending the lockdown is not new. It is a common problem faced all the time in societies, it is just that we don’t always acknowledge this.Some say the lockdown must not end until no one can infect anyone again and thus ensure no-one dies. To put this in perspective, tomorrow we could prevent 1,870 deaths and 157,630 injuries over the next year in Great Britain if we were to stop road traffic. Of course, no-one wants these figures to be this high, hence we have all sorts of rules and regulations to improve road safety. Yet, we all accept that we need road traffic, else the economy and way of life would suffer.Country by country: how many lives have been saved by lockdownsWe cannot stress too much that it is not our purpose to undermine epidemiological models.  The mathematical models of epidemiology have already had one major policy success.  They provide the intellectual underpinning for the policy of lockdown which was necessary, and indeed perhaps overdue, when it was implemented. But the results of these models come with huge levels of uncertainty, which both the general public and decision makers in government might not appreciate.Of course, we have to be sure the reproduction rate of the virus, the R0, is less than one and under control. This is the figure that shows how many people are infected. It is, as we know, complicated further by the nature of this virus, which is why it will be necessary to be rigorous about the rules and the phases by which the lockdown is ended.Data can be utilised in allowing an easing of the lockdown. If we look at east Asia now, we can learn some of their lessons as we gradually unlock. In a host of economies, data apps are available to allow people to maximise their information, ensuring risks are kept to a minimum.The exit strategy can be done in phases. This will address the worries of  epidemiologists. It will avoid what economists call the crowded trade, such as everyone rushing to the exit in a cinema at the same time.What the UK lockdown means for youWe would suggest that lockdown is followed by three phases, as in a traffic lights, from red to amber to green. Then everyone is clear about the sense of direction.We would go, first, from lockdown to red, where we must still stop doing things we might have done before the crisis. Then to amber, as conditions improve, but we still need to be careful. Eventually, back to green, when medical experts can give the all-clear. This process also gives hope. It will reduce the risk that Lord King warned of last week, where lockdown might cause rebellion. It should ease the pressures on mental health and fears about domestic abuse that have risen during the lockdown.The first phase would deliberately be called red, to ensure people stopped to think before they did things. More – but not all – types of shops could open and they would have to exercise strict social distancing, as most supermarkets do now. Many might chose not to reopen, for commercial reasons, as demand would be low. Travel should still be discouraged and many international flights banned.Transport use changeIn the amber phase, unlimited private car journeys should be allowed. People may in fact substitute this for public transport. In order to minimise pressure on public transport, and crowds, there would have to be attempts to vary the rush-hour, with different opening and closing times. Wearing masks and disposable gloves could be compulsory when using public transport.  Restaurants could reopen but with strict seating demarcations, to uphold social distancing.It would only be in the green phase that any sporting events or mass gatherings could take place, or places of worship reopen. It is in large gatherings that a single person may infect many. Mass transit could return to normal.  The lockdown is helping overcome the health risk the country faces. However, only by ending the lockdown can we address the economic challenge.Coronavirus latest news: PM warns world leaders over protectionism after Trump is accused of face mask \u0026#39piracy\u0026#39Comment: From the EU to the USA, this economic collapse threatens the entire world orderWhen will coronavirus peak in the UK?  When will the UK lockdown end?

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korean coronavirus testing experience uk should follow","story":"My eyes watered as the cotton swab was inserted deep into my nose. Then the faceless men in full hazmat suits followed it up with a stick down my throat which made me gag a little.I watched as medics moved around behind the screen in the bright white pop-up walk-through testing booth. It was unnerving and surreal I felt like I was in a nuclear war sci-fi film.But after 45 seconds I had been tested for coronavirus and was told I would receive my results the following day, calming my nerves.South Korea has attracted international attention for its rigorous testing system that is said to have helped contain the virus that looked at the early stages to be out of control. The country is now the envy of places like the UK, which seems to be floundering miles behind when it comes to tracking and, ultimately, stopping the virus.My testing experience started with a routine hospital appointment near my home in Gyeongju, where I teach at the university.I reported to the reception and had my temperature taken, as is now standard. My temperature reading was slightly high and this combined with the fact I had traveled from Gyeongju (which is located in the North-Gyeongsang Province and close to Daegu where the highest number of cases in Korea had been reported) caused some concern.I was directed to another tent where my temperature was taken again and I was asked to fill out a questionnaire. Questions included whether I’d had a cough, cold or any flu-like symptoms or if I was part of Shincheonji, the church where the main clusters of COVID-19 cases in South Korea have occurred.Although I answered no to all the questions I wasn’t able to enter the hospital but a helpful member of staff collected my prescription for me.The staff asked me if I wanted to take a COVID-19 test. It was voluntary but having a slightly high temperature I decided to take the test for W120,000 (£80). I was escorted to another tent where I was greeted by staff in hazmat suits. That\u0027s where my nostrils and throat were scraped with swabs. I was told I would receive a message the next day with the results.At 11am the next day I got a text message in Korean confirming my COVID-19 test was negative. Although I hadn’t been showing any symptoms I was nervous about the results as you can get COVID-19 asymptomatically. I was relieved when the tests showed negative.Being in semi-lockdown since the end of February has been a shock to the system. My wife and I only go out to get essentials and to walk the dogs. Wearing a mask outside is slowly becoming second nature because the majority of other people are doing similar.Things are slowly coming back to normal with the election trucks and their cheerleaders blasting out music for the upcoming local elections on the April 15. Arguably this is the best time of year in Korea as it’s cherry blossom season.My wife and I drove around Gyeongju to see the cherry blossoms, the roads were busy and many people were outside wearing masks taking pictures. Stil,l it’s not yet the time to be in large crowds of people and common sense needs to prevail. The second wave of COVID-19 could be around the corner, the major issue is complacency and people no longer adhering to the rules during this outbreak.The lessons learned from SARS and more recently MERS has definitely helped here. The majority of people are following social distancing and government advice.The amount of emergency alerts have slowed down compared to the end of February with the amount of cases currently being on average 100 a day compared to over 750 a day at its peak.Emergency alerts showing the movements of people who tested positive for COVID-19 are sent out and it’s useful to cross reference them with your own movements. It seems the South Korean authorities are being informative and straight with people with this outbreak, and I\u0027m grateful.I am really worried about the news we keep hearing from the UK. I feel a lot safer here. I really hope my family and friends get through this unscathed and wish I could be with them.It\u0027s alarming that the UK haven\u0027t tested that much at all compared to here. I feel this should have been done weeks ago to be as effective as we have seen it to be in South Korea. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/21/15/credit-cards.jpg","title":"coronavirus overdrafts interest free credit card payments banks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Credit card and loan repayments to be frozen for customers in financial difficulty as pandemic causes unemployment to soarBanks have been told to allow customers an extra £500 interest-free on their existing overdrafts\u0026nbspto help people who are struggling financially during the coronavirus outbreak.They have also been ordered to freeze payments on credit cards and loans.The City watchdog is proposing a range of measures that could be introduced as soon as next Thursday, to help those finding it difficult to make repayments\u0026nbspon their debts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBanks had already been under scrutiny from the Financial Conduct Authority over their approach to overdraft interest rates, which are around 40 per cent for most high street lenders –\u0026nbsproughly double the cost of an average credit card.More people are likely to have to use their overdraft during the crisis.The Department for Work and Pensions revealed this week that it had received\u0026nbsp950,000 claims for Universal Credit in just two weeks.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastUnder the FCA’s plans, customers can ask their bank to freeze payments on their credit cards and personal loans if they are having trouble repaying because of coronavirus.However, consumers will still accrue interest on their credit cards during the repayment holiday, which they will have to pay off at some point.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “This is yet another, important, welcome, yet unprecedented coronavirus-driven market intervention – this time by the regulator.“We have already seen many unsecured lenders put some forbearance criteria in place, a few even more generous than the minimum standards the FCA is imposing – such as entire overdrafts at 0 per cent.“However the provision is patchy and has become a banking lottery and that’s unfair – no one could’ve taken into account when they signed up for products how considerate each lender would be in these extraordinary times.”A brief consultation on the proposals is under way until Monday with changes to be implemented on Thursday, if agreed.

The UK chief medical adviser, Professor Chris Whitty, has said that a vaccine is £one way out of this ... and we all hope that will happen as quickly as possible.US scientists say they have developed a potential coronavirus vaccine that produces antibodies capable of fighting the virus and will apply for ‘investigational new drug’ approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine found the vaccine, tested on mice, produced antibodies in quantities thought to be enough to “neutralise” Covid-19 within two weeks of injection.The team are far from alone: the World Health Organisation says there are at least 20 coronavirus vaccines are in developmental stages around the world, with the first human trials already beginning in Seattle, led by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna. The trial is backed by the national institutes of health (NIH) and Kaiser Permanente Washington Research Institute.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe speed at which Moderna’s vaccine is entering human trials is unprecedented, largely thanks to Chinese scientists sharing the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2 — a move that allowed research groups to grow the live virus and study its behaviour. Researchers were given permission to skip the usual animal testing phase.In the UK, scientists from Imperial College London said earlier this month they have a “prototype vaccine” with “encouraging” results that could soon be tested on humans.Dr Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at the university’s department of infectious disease said: “It is a global effort. We are not racing against each other – we are racing against the virus.”But despite the number of teams working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine, it could still take around 18 months for any potential vaccine to become available to the general public.Anthony Fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in the US and one of Donald Trump’s top health officials, said the process of developing a vaccine “is going to take a year, year-and-a-half at least”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The phases begin with a small pool of healthy volunteers to test the vaccine for safety and monitor it for adverse effects. Next, a larger pool of several hundred people are tested to monitor how effective the vaccine is, and lastly, the same process is repeated in a pool of several thousand people.Scientists also have to make allowances for variables in the pools of people being tested. Candidates are randomly assigned to either treatment groups or control groups to determine the efficacy of treatments being administered, but some outcomes may prove to be ineffective or unsafe, or both.Ultimately, scientists must still adhered to the strict protocol involved in developing potential vaccines despite the pressure to move quickly. Any drug can only be made available after a national licensing body or the WHO approves it.Dr Simon Clarke, professor or cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told The Independent: “With vaccines you have to generate an immune response that is protective enough – any old immune response won’t do. It has to be able to protect against subsequent infections when that happens.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeHe added: “I remind people we’ve been trying to find a vaccine for HIV for the best part of 40 years.”There is some light at the end of the tunnel.

Of those, 22 have already shut.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA further administration is now being considered with KPMG among the firms said to be in the running to handle it.Sky News reported that Debenhams could file a notice of intention to appoint administrators as next week but other options are being explored.Mike Ashley funding lawsuit to ‘eliminate Debenhams as a competitor’A spokesperson for the retailer\u0026nbspsaid: Like all retailers, Debenhams is making contingency plans reflecting the extraordinary current circumstances.Our owners and lenders remain highly supportive and whatever actions we may take will be with a view to protecting the business during the current situation.While our stores remain closed in line with government guidance, and the majority of our store-facing colleagues have been furloughed, our website continues to trade and we are accepting customer orders, gift cards and returns.”Debenhams put most of its workforce on furlough last week after closing all 140 of its UK stores as the country entered lockdown to slow the spread of Covid-19.The move means the government is covering up to 80 per cent of employees\u0027 salaries under the Coronavirus Job retention Scheme.The BBC reported this week that Debenhams was to launch a major restructuring after seeking an urgent deal with its landlords. That could involve further permanent store closures.KPMG declined to comment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their feud escalated so much it ended up with Exotic being sentenced to 22 years in prison for crimes including trying to hire someone to murder Baskin.The eccentricity of Tiger King’s subjects made the show extremely bingeable, so if you’ve finished the series and are craving more wackiness, check out our list of other bizarre documentaries available on Netflix…Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis hit documentary shares two of Tiger King’s key ingredients: it has an exceptionally unusual man at its centre, and it chronicles a fierce rivalry. Wild Wild Country tells the story of how Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his right-hand woman Ma Anand Sheela led a group of followers to a small town in Oregon and founded a cult. Clashes with local residents evolved into a full-blown war involving threats, fraud, and even bioterrorism.Is Tiger King just a celebration of abuse?Fyre: The Greatest Party that Never HappenedBefore Joe Exotic became a household name, the team behind Tiger King made Fyre. This documentary charts the spectacular failure of Ja Rule’s “music festival” in the Bahamas, which made headlines worldwide after guests who had paid as much as $100,000 for tickets turned up to a ramshackle site with limited shelter and food. Like Tiger King, it introduces us to fascinating characters – most notably event producer\u0026nbspAndy King, who became a meme after admitting he nearly performed fellatio in order to convince Bahamian customs authorities to give water to attendees.Tell Me Who I AmThis is another documentary that matches Tiger King on the “bonkers” scale. Tell Me Who I Am revolves around Alex, a man who has lost his long-term memory after a bike accident. The only person who can help piece Alex’s life back together is his identical twin brother and, incredibly, the pair let cameras into the room to record the tragic story of their childhood being revealed.When three teenagers meet by chance and discover they are identical triplets separated at birth, they are over the moon. But, as this documentary reveals, their adoption was far from normal, and what starts out as a joyful reunion story quickly turns into something much more sinister. If you’re missing the twists and turns of Tiger King, this series has got plenty of those.​Abducted in Plain SightThis unsettling documentary tells the story of Jan Broberg, a child who was kidnapped from her family by their friend, Robert Berchtold, twice. Somehow, Berchtold was able to manipulate the religious Broberg family, effectively grooming them, which enabled him to abduct and abuse Jan.A documentary that will fill that feline-shaped hole in your life is Don’t F*** With Cats. When it came out, viewers branded it the “most disturbing” series they had ever seen.\u0026nbspIt centres around a Canadian murderer,\u0026nbspLuka Magnotta, and the amateur detective work carried out to catch him after he posted a graphic video of himself killing two kittens online.Tiger King’s Carole Baskin claims that, when she was being courted by Netflix to take part in the documentary, it was pitched to her as the “big cat version of Blackfish”. While it didn’t quite turn out that way, the two shows do share some major similarities. Blackfish, once described as being “as gripping as a serial-killer thriller”, exposed animal abuse at SeaWorld.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He said: “If you’re in a fortunate position, I ask you to volunteer to help those less fortunate.

From a young age,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspacted as a carer for her mother, at times having to bathe and feed her.Corbyn was a disaster for five years – let’s not rehabilitate him nowAt one point,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwas forced to have her mother admitted to a mental health ward because she was struggling with suicidal thoughts.Rayner\u0026nbsphas spoken movingly about being told she would “never amount to anything” after becoming\u0026nbsppregnant at 16 and leaving school without any qualifications.\u0026nbspShe credits New Labour’s Sure Start centres, where she took a parenting course,\u0026nbspwith helping her find her feet.Showing the determination that would later power her political career,\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwent to college part time and then got a job as one of the youngest home helps in Stockport.She became a trade union representative, later rising to become Unison’s most senior official in the northwest.In 2015\u0026nbspRayner\u0026nbspwas elected as MP for\u0026nbspAshton-under-Lyne. In her maiden speech, she talked of how her detractors put her down, saying: “If only they could see me now.”She nominated Andy Burnham to be Labour leader in 2015 but she was one of few\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho supported Jeremy Corbyn when he was challenged by Owen Smith the following year.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her nominations for the deputy leadership came from across the different parts of the parliamentary party, from left wingers such as her friend\u0026nbspRebecca Long-Bailey and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, to moderates such as Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves.Plenty of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsphave said privately that they wish she had gone for the top job instead of backing Long-Bailey, her friend and flatmate. Rayner\u0026nbsphas spoken openly about the challenges women from her background face, which\u0026nbspclearly played a part in her decision to run for the number two role.But keeping her powder dry may also prove smart in the long run, considering the uphill battle the new party leader faces.Tony Blair on how Labour can learn from his time in power to win againOut in the country, she received more than four times the number of constituency party nominations than her nearest rival Dawn Butler, by 363 to 82. And she won the backing of several big unions – a critical step for any MP with leadership ambitions.Rayner’s significant early lead meant the other candidates had to be more outspoken and colourful to attract attention.By contrast,\u0026nbspher campaign was relatively low profile –\u0026nbspone of her few similarities with Boris Johnson, who ran an almost submarine-like\u0026nbspbid to be Conservative leader in 2019.The\u0026nbspAshton-under-Lyne\u0026nbspMP\u0026nbspwas careful not to squander her lead, making\u0026nbspthoughtful interventions and granting relatively few interviews.Her down-to-earth nature and\u0026nbspher honesty over her early experiences of deprivation appear to have done much of the heavy lifting for her, making her relatable\u0026nbspto many voters.A pragmatist at heart, Rayner\u0026nbspbased her deputy leadership\u0026nbspcampaign on calls for “everyday socialism that’s rooted in peoples lives”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Health Secretary Matt Hancock and NHS staff stand on marks on the ground, put in place to ensure social distancing guidelines are adhered to, at the opening of the NHS Nightingale Hospital at the ExCel centre in London, a temporary hospital with 4000 beds which has been set up for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.

Videos purportedly showing telephone masts on fire have also circulated online.Condemning the theories on Saturday at a No 10 press conference, Mr Gove,\u0026nbspthe minister for the cabinet office, said: “That’s just nonsense.

It is absolute, utter rubbish and I can’t condemn it in terms stronger than that.”Mr Gove also said that a further 708 people in the UK had lost their lives after contracting coronavirus, including seven health care professionals – bringing the country’s death toll to 4,313. A total of 183,190 have so far been tested for the virus, of whom 41,903 were positive.“Those numbers emphasise the importance of maintaining social distancing measures to halt the spread of the disease,” the cabinet minister said as he urged the British public to adhere to the government’s strict lockdown guidance despite the warming weather.Professor Powis added that new cases of coronavirus appeared to have stabled, but also insisted now is not the time to “take our foot off the pedal” with social distancing measures. “We need to continue to comply with those instructions because that will translate in the next week or two into a reduction in hospital admissions,” he said.Earlier, Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has been advising the government on the outbreak of the virus, suggested that the UK’s epidemic could plateau in the next week to 10 days, and also suggested that lockdown restrictions could be relaxed by the end of May if the social distancing rules are followed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So who might replace them?The most important pick and biggest clue to Sir Keir’s leadership plans will be who he puts in charge of the finances – just as Mr Corbyn’s choice of Mr McDonnell signalled his “no compromise” style. Two names are in the frame:•\u0026nbspRachel Reeves – a former Bank of England economist who wrote a study on the 2008 financial crash.\u0026nbspShe was sent into exile by the Corbyn revolution but has the intellectual credentials and has impressed as head of the Commons business committee.•\u0026nbspAnneliese Dodds – unlike her potential rival, she served the outgoing leader as a Treasury spokesperson, and won plaudits for her media appearances, without being stained by the failed project.The prominent Labour Party names who look to be in line for a return from the backbenches include:•\u0026nbspYvette Cooper – a cabinet member more than 20 years ago, she flirted with a leadership bid this year before deciding she had no chance of winning, but still hungers after a leading role.•\u0026nbspEd Miliband – could the former leader, to whom Sir Keir is sometimes compared, make a comeback, perhaps to pursue his passion for tackling climate change?The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email•\u0026nbspDavid Lammy – once tipped to be Britain’s first black cabinet minister, he has thrived on the backbenches as a fierce critic of Brexit and of the Windrush scandal.•\u0026nbspHilary Benn – a forensic critic of the government’s EU policy, as the Commons Brexit committee chairman, he was shadow foreign secretary until sacked by Mr Corbyn in 2016.Sir Keir will want to promote from the impressive cohort of newer MPs on Labour’s benches, most probably:•\u0026nbspConor McGinn – Northern Irish, and a one-time Communist, Mr McGinn fell out with Mr Corbyn and resigned as a whip, but can be expected to return.•\u0026nbspMarsha de Cordova – only an MP since 2017, she was born with the eye condition nystagmus and is registered blind. Currently the shadow minister for disabled people.•\u0026nbspRushanara Ali – like Ms de Cordova, a London MP, Ms Ali nominated Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2015, but turned against him a year later.Shadow cabinet jobs have been promised to the defeated Rebecca Long Bailey and Lisa Nandy, but that offer may not extend to early fallers Emily Thornberry and Jess Phillips.Asked for his favourite Labour leader, Sir Keir plumped for Harold Wilson – praising the way the infamous schemer “managed to hold bits of the party together” – but it will be a miracle if he can do the same.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was knighted in 2014 for services to law and criminal justice.In parliament, Starmer backed Andy Burnham in the 2015 leadership election and was appointed a shadow Home Office minister within months of entering the House of Commons.He quit the post in 2016 as part of a mass resignation by Labour MPs protesting about Corbyn’s leadership, but returned to the frontbench later that year as shadow Brexit secretary.In that role, he exerted pressure to shift the party’s position gradually towards support for a second EU referendum, famously declaring at the 2018 Labour conference that Remain must be on the ballot paper in any vote.As Corbyn tried to maintain an “honest broker” stance keeping both Remain and Leave options open, Starmer appeared alongside other senior figures at last October’s giant Final Say rally in Westminster to demand a public vote.His increasingly open support for a referendum infuriated some Labour MPs who blamed him for helping drive Leave-voting Labour supporters in the Midlands and North into the arms of Johnson’s Conservatives at the subsequent election.Soon after Corbyn’s announcement he was standing down, Starmer signalled his determination to hold the party’s wings together by declaring it was important for Labour not to “oversteer” away from the outgoing leader’s programme.In a list of 10 pledges, he has promised to stick to a series of Corbyn’s policies, including increasing taxes for the top 5 per cent of earners, reversing corporation tax cuts, abolishing Universal Credit, establishing a green “new deal”, scrapping university tuition fees and renationalising rail, mail, water and energy.Despite calls from some quarters for Labour to broaden its appeal by choosing a woman from outside London as its new leader, Starmer swiftly secured nominations from influential unions including Unison, Usdaw and the TSSA and took an overwhelming lead in constituency nominations, with 374 to 164 for his main rival Rebecca Long-Bailey – even picking up the support of Corbyn’s Islington North.Born in London in 1962 to a toolmaker father and nurse mother, Starmer was named after the Labour Party’s founder and first MP Keir Hardie. He passed the 11-plus to win a place at grammar school and studied law at Leeds University and Oxford, becoming a barrister in 1987.Married to Victoria with two children, his leadership campaign was disrupted by a serious accident suffered by his mother-in-law, who died on 8 February after two weeks in hospital.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And a blast-proof cellar ready to be fitted with an air-filtration system.The bunk beds are waiting to be assembled. I can tell you all you need to know about the decay cycle of radioactive Cobalt-. I even have iodine tablets.See  I chose THE WRONG BLOODY APOCALYPSE.I thought it was going to be nuclear bombs raining down on us. And I was well ready.But when the Four Horsemen eventually turned up, it wasn’t with nukes. It was with a bit of a bad cough.What I needed wasn’t a Geiger counter, but a ventilator. And paracetamol. How was I to know Probably because I was a Cold War kid and that’s how we all expected to go back then.Anyway, I might put my Geiger counter on Ebay.I’m asking £ or six rolls of toilet paper and some tinned tomatoes. And a Twix.And so here, in week two of the Great Lockdown, I’m pretty much useless.Unless you want to know the proportions of lead and concrete needed to minimise the radioactive fallout from a ten-megaton blast.One thing is bothering me, however.And that’s the Old Bill getting a bit overzealous in pursuit of people. Ordinary people going for a walk.A friend of mine was walking her dog in a London park when two rozzers turned up on horseback.They told her not to throw a ball for the dog.Why not  Because it might have Covid- on its fur and bump into someone .Um . . . might not the police horses also have Covid- on their fur And then there’s the Derbyshire coppers sending a drone to harass some bloke out for a walk in the Peak District. Entirely alone, not a danger to anyone.The chief plod of Derbyshire has been defending his force’s actions.Meanwhile, other forces have been naming and shaming the alleged “covidiots” on social media.I don’t think the Old Bill have ever been happier. They’re loving this.I know we must not take unnecessary journeys.I know we need to employ social distancing.People holding house parties and so on is crazy.I think the vast majority of us grasp this.But this is a tricky time. The public needs to be kept onside.We need to be able to respect our police, just as we respect the Government’s advice.Overzealous behaviour by the coppers does not help.Why should a bloke not swig from a can of beer in a park How is that more dangerous than taking your dog for a walk Why is being totally alone in a wilderness area a danger to other people There needs to be some common sense employed.Meanwhile, regarding my Geiger counter, the batteries are included.And for an extra roll of bog paper I’ll throw in the full-colour chart showing the ious symptoms of radiation poisoning.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.THE wildle is just loving this lockdown, though.I’ve never seen so many foxes, badgers and deer out where I live.It’s because people aren’t going out.And I like the thought that the animals are always there, just waiting for us humans to come a cropper.I also enjoyed the patrol of goats which have taken over the Welsh resort of Llandudno.Watch your backs, you goats.MIDDLE CLASS: Sacking the nanny and the cleaner in case they give the virus to Cressida, two, and Wolfgang, four.Growing hydroponic vegetables in the annex, enough for half a salad by next Feb.Writing letters of complaint to the board of Waitrose about the unavailability of dried black limes and manchego.Stockpiling hummus.Cycling round the local park wearing chemical warfare gear.Trying, desperately, to sell their three-bedroom cottage in North East Italy.Washing their hands every  seconds with Duchy Original Organic Fairtrade Hand Sanitiser.Trying to fit a face mask on Corbyn, their Labrador.Removing the back seats from the Range Rover for the next click and collect.Hoping to get a nice postcard from their oldest son, Oliver, who has been on his gap year in Wuhan.WORKING CLASS: Getting p***ed watching Netflix.ONE of the surprising benefactors of this virus has been the BBC.Only a couple of months ago its very existence was in doubt.The Government was planning to decriminalise non-payment of its licence fee.People were sick to the back teeth of its patent political bias.But in general, it’s done very well during this crisis.Some of its news programmes have adapted brilliantly.Not Newsnight, obvs, which is still a jabbering gripefest.But the Radio Four PM programme has been excellent.It’s presenter, Evan Davis, has an affable calmness – and he asks the right questions.Radio Five has adapted well, too – although I’d junk ALL of the sport right now.Butonly the BBC could cover politics with the same lack of bias it is now using to cover the pandemic.I SAW that a bully Builder Who Shot His Partner, Their Two Daughters, Four and Two, Their Pet Dog and Then Himself At Their £, Sussex home was described as “a nasty Piece Of Work” by a Neighbour.Sheesh! Really  Was he  Well, blow me down.You can create your own similar story by having a neighbour state the bleedin’ obvious in any tale you fancy.“Woman, , Who Died After Eating , Cadbury Creme Eggs and  Daim Bars ‘Liked Chocolate’ Says Neighbour.”Over to you.I THINK my favourite observation online about this wretched virus was this. “January  – yeah, this is gonna be MY year!“March  – wiping my a*** with a Pot Noodle lid.”It is all a bit grim. And we’ve only been under lockdown for a week or so.But I’m slightly with Piers Morgan when he says “man up”.My dad was a working-class bloke from the North East of England.He got himself into a grammar school and had a chance to go to university. But the war stopped that.At  he was serving on a motor torpedo boat in the channel.My mum, meanwhile, was evacuated as a kid, taken away from her parents. Then her house was bombed flat.In  the Luftwaffe bombed our cities every night, death raining down.That strikes me as being real hardship.All we’ve been asked to do is sit on the sofa for a while, eating crisps.I think we can probably get through this, you know.THINGS nobody has been talking about, anywhere, since the crisis hit us.This last one is the most interesting.At times like this nobody caresyou’re black, white, brown, gay, transgender, Muslim or Jewish.Everyone grasps that we’re all in this together.If only, once this is over, we could understand that we’re STILL in all this together.And that identity politics simply causes unnecessary isions between us.ONCE this is all over the Chinese have a few questions to answer.Mainly about the degree to which their government has not been honest.Either about the start of the virus, deaths and the rate of infection right now.And what happened to the heroic Chinese doctors who tried to warn the world  At least one has disappeared.China is a devious, totalitarian and hostile country.

He hasn’t thought it through no matter how many chins of mine he might think he can sht, it ain’t worth spilling perfectly good lager or ales.Nevertheless,that hyperactive chancer can unite the nation, then someone like me who doesn’t go at ramming-speed the whole time can surely help. He’s the hare, I’m the tortoise.But what this is all about is morale. Morale is important: it’s the key component of any battle and that’s what we are in the middle of right now.And as we near the end of our second week in national solitary confinement, I imagine tempers may be fraying, time might be hanging heavy, maybe the way you’re rubbing along has got you chafing a bit: I know I am, I gave up bathing last weekend, I’m on my own, who cares what I smell like.So, here’s a cut out and loose guide to how to keep your morale up and avoid those moments which lord knows you’ll regret, because it’s not like you can go down the pub and moan to your mates about what happened.Dishwasher stacking disputes. You think the knives should point up not down.The amount of times people can fall out over this sort of simple day-to-day admin in normal le is something I’ve heard from my regular drinkers time and time again, so no doubt in lockdown-land this one is raging all day, every day.You know what: forget it. It ain’t worth it. Simply rule yourself out of stacking or emptying the dishwasher – problem solved.Deciding what to watch on the TV. We live in an age of a billion channels and nothing to watch. And they’re not making any more TV either: even Eastenders could grind to a halt. Yes that’s how serious this whole thing is. So whoever has control of the TV rules the roost.The remote is the key to this problem. Seize control: seeing as you aren’t going anywhere or doing anything, superglue the remote to the hand you use the least and retain control of the TV.This may seem extreme but it’ll simply mean there’s one great big argument when you reveal what you’ve done, rather than the long slow drip drip drip of anger about your third week of watching Homes Under The Hammer.Ironing and or folding the laundry. Ironing, for some, is a % flash point. This is how the argument runs. You leave something out to dry, then some thoughtless Herbert chucks it all in a laundry basket in a heap and you have to iron it.Immediately a row ensues about why there’s no need to iron tracksuit bottoms anyway and remember the time you burned that nylon shirt because you had the iron on too hot you idiot.Compromise. Now here’s the thing. It’s not like you’ve got anywhere to be. It’s not like your glad rags are going to get any attention over the next few days.Maybe you’re a slave to fashion and were looking forward to moving from your spring to your summer wardrobe. Whatever that means. But there is no need to iron stuff right now. None. Zero.So put the iron down. Unless of course, it’s something you like doing to calm the nerves, pass the time, inject some sense of order into what is currently a formless existence. In other words, let the ironer iron. But onlytotally necessary. Remember, in the end would you rather be right or happy  And the answer to that is happy. Unless of course what makes you happy is being right. But you get my point.And remember, chins up Britain, all of them.Hats off to all the people who two weeks ago were panicking and spreading rumours about the army being deployed.During the fortnight these Scary Maries were crying into their soda waters about imminent martial law the army quietly got on with setting up a brand-new hospital. Give yourselves a round of applause, you s.Oh yeah you all bought bog roll, but judging by the towpath by the canal none of you bought poo bags for your dogs.SORT IT!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that.

Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Last night deputy chief medical officer John Van-Tam explained there was no evidence that wearing a mask stops the spread of the virus.Speaking at the daily press conference in No, he said: Yes it is true that we do see very large amounts of mask wearing particularly in Southeast Asia but we have always seen that for many decades and it is entirely wired into some cultures that masks are worn quite frequently in open spaces. So its very dferent.But in terms of the hard evidence and what the UK Government recommends, we do not recommend face masks for general wearing by the public.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But you know what  I’ve spent  years on a journey to the moment. This enemy is dferent to what we’re used to dealing with. This is a threat you can’t see.“Yes it’s a big job, without a doubt. But it’s achievable.“I’ve got the experience. I’m the right person at the right time for this particular project.”There are plans to replicate the build in other large venues across the UK, with the NHS confirming on Friday that there are plans for four few sites.NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said that more NHS Nightingale hospitals would be built in Birmingham, Bristol, Harrogate and Manchester.The new emergency centres, which the Army will help to plan and build, will offer up to , beds between them.The Army are also planning to embed their medics in hospitals to support NHS workers.Last month,  British Army medics were withdrawn from a military exercise in eastern Europe to prepare for deployment in the UK.Ministry of Defence has recently drawn up plans for up to , trained members of the Defence Medical Service to help on the frontline.Finally, the Army is helping to transport vital equipment to hospitals across the country.Troops have been transporting masks and other protective equipment, and  troops are being trained to drive oxygen tankers.The Royal Navy has also been supporting the UK’s effort to combat coronavirus, lending its helicopters to the NHS.Three Navy choppers based on the south coast will help the South West Ambulance Services, supporting more than ,, people in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Bristol and Somerset.The Merlin MK helicopters and their crews, which are usually used for hunting submarines, will be working -hour shts carrying stretchers and coronavirus patients to nearby hospitals.The helicopters’ Commanding Officer Chris Knowles said: “This is very dferent from our ordinary role, but jobs like this are in our DNA.“We are helping out the nation and the National Health Service during these testing times – it’s a real moment for everyone to pull together.”The Navy has also been assisting in helicopter practice exercises to the North East, where three Wildcat choppers will be tasked with delivering supplies, ferrying medics and carrying patients.The helicopters manoeuvred through Newcastle city centre and past the famous Tyne Bridge to land at NHS Calliope, HQ for  Royal Navy Reservists.The seaborne service, however, isn’t just helping the UK’s effort, with the Navy sending a battleship to assist in the British Overseas Territories.On Thursday, the RFA Argus was dispatched to the Caribbean, where it will support the islands during the pandemic.The -metre ship has previously operated off the coast of Yemen and Iraq, and featured in the Hollywood hit World War Z.Merlin and Wildcat helicopters were also sent to support the ship.Finally, Navy submariners have given advice to Brits about how to cope in self-isolation.While on patrol, submarine teams can spend months under the water and have little contact with the outside world.Sub Lieutenant Andrew Rose said people should find a routine to get through self-isolation.He said: “Get a routine and stick to it. There’s plenty we could do in the house such as cleaning, exercising, contacting family or friends, learn a new skill etc.“Also remember that, just like being at sea, isolation won’t last forever. Have something to look forward to and try not to get too downhearted. Think of the things you and your friends will be able to do once it’s all over!”The RAF is doing its bit to help UK’s coronavirus response too, evacuating patients from remote areas of the country and setting up temporary mortuaries in aircraft hangers.In late March, and RAF transport aircraft evacuated a man with COVID- from the Scottish Shetland Islands.The Atlas plane, which can carry up to  troops, alongside helicopters and other vehicles weighing up to  tonnes, took the man in his s to an intensive care unit in Aberdeen.Alongside this, the RAF has provided helicopters to help NHS hospitals across the country.The service has dispatched three choppers to Moray, in Scotland, and two to Leeming, in North Yorkshire, where they will move equipment, medical personnel and patients.The Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, said that the aircraft “are ready to support emergency services and local communities wherever needed across the highlands and islands of Scotland – the Armed Forces have always got your back.”Prince William wants to help the new helicopter support teams andto the frontline as an air ambulance pilot.On a visit to an NHS call centre in March, he revealed that he missed working in the le-saving role.A source told The Sun last week: “William has been seriously considering ing as an air ambulance pilot to help in the current pandemic.“He knows the whole country is doing its bit and he wants to help. But it’s complicated as he was originally grounded from the job so that he could become a senior working royal.”Finally, RAF aircraft hangars could be used to store up to , coronavirus victims.Footage shot inside a disused US airbase in Oxfordshire showed hangars filled with plastic sheeting and scaffolding, built to hold the bodies of those killed by COVID-.In a statement, Oxfordshire County Council said: “In common with all other areas of the country, there are longstanding contingency plans to provide extra mortuary space during emergency situations.“Partners from organisations including the NHS, registration services, Coroner’s office and local authorities have been meeting regularly to consider requirements that may be placed upon Oxfordshire during the coronavirus outbreak.“This has led to a temporary facility being prepared at the former RAF base at Heyford Park, which will be usedrequired.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday.

It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

It was like her office.“Meghan is also a big fan of Erewhon, a super high-end natural foods grocer in West Hollywood, which was her health food holy grail.“She loves hiking and keeping fit, so she hopes to be able to do a few of her favourite trails, albeit with security in tow now.“She will have a private gym at the new pad, so it’s unlikely she will use one of her old spin studios like Soul Cycle.”Her mum Doria, who -year-old Harry is also close to, regularly visits the Agape Spiritual Center, a non-denominational church in the LA suburb of Culver City, and Meghan often used to accompany her to services.A source added: “That was a big part of their relationship and spiritual connection.“Some celebrities go there, so I wouldn’t be surprisedMeghan showed up there again.”The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealAlthough mother and daughter cannot see one another at present, Doria will be making extended visits to the couple’s home, once they get settled.The source continued: “Doria will definitely have a presence in their day-to-day le.“Plus, of course, she can act as a pretty wonderful babysitter for Archie.“Doria adores her grandson, and would be thrilled to help outcalled upon.”Not surprisingly, Meghan’s estranged dad Thomas, , will not be invited — even though he lives just  miles away in Rosarito, Mexico.The source added: “He is just noise for her at this point.“He would be a liability for her, with all the drama he brings to the table, while she wants to pursue a philanthropic .“Meghan has a young son now and her priority is her immediate family, her work and helping others where she can.”Undoubtedly Meghan will be using the next six months to focus on family time with Harry and their -month-old son.Being in LA, the duke and duchess are expected to employ personal trainers to get them fit for the summer months.One well-placed source also predicted the royal pair would be visitors to the Pilates studio of Meghan’s pal Heather Dorak.The insider said of the duchess: “I’m not surprised she came back.“It’s her home, and now she has the influence and star power she never had before. It’s the ideal situation for her.“She has been able to bring Harry into her perfect scenario.“I imagine she will just make it about enjoying the beach, fresh air, and being tucked away in the canyons.“Keeping it simple and finding her rhythm, being present and fit while raising Archie under the palm trees and the familiarity of her home town.“I think she will try to be very private and protective of Harry.“She will probably be getting him to make friends with the agents, managers and some stars but will try not to expose him to too many alien things.She has already got what she wants, to move to LA, and I don’t think she will want to push him too hard.”The ambitious pair have put any big announcements on hold following the outbreak of coronavirus.But a trio of power-players including Meghan’s agent at The Gersh Agency, Nick Collins, her business manager Andrew Meyer and lawyer Rick Genow, are already weighing up offers.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.A Gersh source said: “Nick has seen interest in Harry and Meghan go through the roof since they announced their split from the Royal Family.“Sure, he looks after her Hollywood opportunities, but also the volume of advertising and speaking opportunities is huge.“If they said yes to everything that was offered to them and Archie, they would be able to buy a £million Los Angeles home and have plenty of change left over.”Another home they are said to have had their eyes on is ,sq ft Petra Manor.It is in a private canyon complex called Serra Retreat, and was once owned by Hollywood actor Mel Gibson.The property, once rented by Kylie Jenner, was still available to view this week – with an eye-watering rent of £, a night.Along with Pacic Palisades, locals have also heard that Meghan and Harry are keen on a home in The Colony, the gated Malibu enclave where their neighbours would be actor Tom Hanks and former tennis champ John McEnroe. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So I went to a local bakery, Boulbys in Horbury, and asked of they could supply me with some bread.“I started buying loaves each day and delivering to the elderly and vulnerable. The bakery told me older people like the little teacakes so they made me up a batch and I’ve left them on the doorsteps of people I know.“I don’t want any praise for doing this. It’s about respecting the elderly. We are all in this together.’Grateful beneficiary Brenda Schofield, , nominated him and said: “Austin is helpful all year round but now he’s been brilliant.

When we’ve tried to get to the supermarket, the shelves have been bare. Julian and Janet are the best neighbours you could ever wish for.“They would do anything for us.

She and her family are potentially bringing the virus to the area.”Wearing a turquoise jacket, Dr Calderwood looked like she didn’t have a care in the world as she walked with her family and dogs near her bolthole on Saturday.But locals in the quiet coastal town hit out over the seemingly unnecessary trip, which came after a working week in Edinburgh where she spoke at daily pandemic press briefings alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.Residents accused her of failing to heed her own government’s advice that people with second properties should stay at home to protect rural communities during the outbreak.The source said Dr Calderwood was one of several other high-flyers from Edinburgh who had second properties in the area and were putting locals at risk.One onlooker told The Scottish Sun on Sunday: “They were going for a walk with the dogs. It’s weird.“I thought she lived in Edinburgh and that we were supposed to stay home — but this place is miles away.”On Thursday, Dr Calderwood shared a photo of her family outside her capital home taking part in the national Clap for Carers event.The image was posted as millions ventured on to their doorsteps to applaud our NHS heroes and care workers.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe snap was taken in the driveway of her upmarket West End home — said to be worth around £.million.Under the hashtag ‘clap for NHS’, the health bigwig told her , followers: “My family clapping my NHS and care colleagues — and me!

But her second home in Earlsferry is  miles away from the capital.This weekend’s trip comes just days after Nats chiefs called for emergency powers to stop second-home owners self-isolating in rural areas, including the Highlands.MP Ian Blackford said legislation should be used to protect areas with less health infrastructure from visitors trying to flee the coronavirus.He spoke out after a number of communities reacted angrily as tourists blocked lay-bys and swamped camping areas.Mr Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said: “With Easter almost upon us it is worth reminding everyone of the emergency powers that restrict non-essential travel.“That means no tourists should be coming to the Highlands and Islands.“If anyone owns a second or holiday home they should not be using the Highlands to self-isolate and powers exist and must be used to stop this.”Similar warnings have also been issued in England and Wales.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not consider people going to their holiday homes as an essential trip during the crisis.His plea followed concerns that rural health services could be overwhelmed by those leaving cities who then end up suffering from Covid-.Mr Hancock said: “We’ve said that people should not take unnecessary journeys, no unnecessary travel and I don’t regard going to your holiday home as a necessary journey.”Today it was revealed that a further  people have died from coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total number of deaths to .The UK-wide total increased by  to ,.The latest deaths including a child aged just five — the youngest UK victim so far.The Scottish Government said , people had now tested positive for the virus, an increase of  from Friday.In total, , patients have been tested across the country.We told how people are now only permitted to leave their homesthey have “reasonable excuse”.This includes work that cannot be carried out at home, shopping for food and medical supplies and an hour of daily exercise.In the six days since new legislation was introduced, police officers have been forced to issue  fixed penalty notices to people who have chosen to ignore the measures.Belfast-born Dr Calderwood has pleaded with Scots to stay at home to protect the NHS and “help save lives” — including on TV and radio ads and at daily press briefings on the pandemic with Ms Sturgeon.The health chief is a trained consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.She is also a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and is an honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.When asked to explain the official view on travelling to a second home tonight, a Scottish Government spokesman said: “We strongly advise against any travel to second homes.“It runs the risk of adding pressure to services in more remote and quieter areas, from food supply to health care.”The Scottish Sun on Sunday then asked why the Chief Medical Officer was ignoring official advice.An SNP Government spokesman replied: “Since this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotland’s response.“She took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over.“She stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh.

Mr Gove said the NHS now has more than , ventilators and the government aims to increase capacity. He said a team from University College London working with Mercedes Benz has produced a new non-invasive respirator that has been clinically approved. Mr Gove said the device is vital in reducing the number of patients who eventually need to be intubated. He said: They produced  yesterday, they will produce the same number today and tomorrow, rising to , a day next week. We are also increasing the capacity of the NHS to deploy invasive ventilation, we have been buying invasive ventilators from partners abroad including Germany and Switzerland. And today  new ventilators arrived from China. Mr Gove said the first devices ordered from Oxford-based medical devices company Penlon will begin arriving in hospitals next week, delivered by the Ministry of Defence.  He said the first devices from Smiths Group had been received at MoD Donnington - a military logistics hub in Shropshire. Mr Gove said: The initial dispatch is the result of scaled up manufacturing of an existing mechanical ventilator design and I am grateful for the efforts of an industry consortium including GKN Aerospace and Rolls Royce. These ventilators will be distributed to hospitals next week.  The Cabinet Office minister said ventilators are essential to give patients the care they need - adding that the government is doing all it can to ease the crisis. He said: The more ventilators - invasive and non-invasive - available to the NHS, the more patients get the care they need, when they need it. But the process of design, assembly, testing and manufacture does take time and we need to make sure that these devices are safe and their manufacture scaleable. Mr Gove also said that the new Nightingale Hospital at Londonaposs ExCel centre can treat  patients on ventilators. He added more field hospitals are being built in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardf, Belfast, Glasgow, Harrogate and Manchester.Mr Gove urged people to stay inside over the weekend, resisting the temptation of going out because of the sunny weather. Speaking about the importance of social distancing, he said: More than ever, we must stick with it. I know that le under lockdown can be challenging, and some will be tempted on this sunny weekend to venture out and about. If we relax our adherence to the rules, we increase the risk for others.

The MP owns at least  per cent of a company investing in businesses hit by falling share values. Somerset Capital Management says investors have a “once in a generation” chance of “super normal s”. Mr Rees-Mogg stood down as a director of SCM to become Leader of the House of Commons. SCM said it was focusing on clients’ long-term security. It came as the UK death toll rose by a record  – including a boy aged five. As millions face financial misery, SCM managers are buying into businesses where valuations have tumbled – but should bounce back. Potential gains of  per cent are touted. Investments so far include private hospitals in Brazil, pharmacies in South Africa and a firm behind a scanning device which checkspeople are wearing masks in China. The revelation was greeted with dismay by new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who said: “Nobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis.We should all be asking ourselves what we can do for our country and each other.” Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: “This is about as sick as it comes. Profit seeking from suffering is nearly as low as you can get. When we come through this we need a tax on profiteers.” SCM’s strategy comes amid a crisis that has killed , globally, while a further ,, are infected. The UK death toll yesterday rose  to ,. Some , have tested positive. While the economic impact has seen almost a million Brits sign up for Universal Credit, finance houses have been quick to move. Mr Rees-Mogg, , stood down as a director of SCM so he could become Leader of the Commons last July. But he owns at least  per cent, meaning he was entitled to a reported £million share of last year’s £.million profits.  Father-of-six Mr Rees-Mogg, who lives in a mansion in Somerset, is reportedly worth more than £million. That could risea plan by SCM’s Emerging Markets Discovery Fund pays off.Fund boss Mark Asquith said in promotional material that investors could capitalise on smaller companies in particular, with prices down up to  per cent. He wrote: “History has shown us that super normal s can be made during this type of environment.Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors.”  Mr Asquith cited  per cent profits made after the  crisis and suggested “we could see similar moves”. SCM, which has a £.billion portfolio of client funds, is so keen to attract investors it has waived a .% management fee. Giving examples where they hope to profit, Mr Asquith’s co-manager Christopher White identied Hapvida, a Brazilian medical insurance company which also runs hospitals. It has a deal to care for patients in the public health system. Stock has also been bought in Clicks, South Africa’s leading pharmacy.SCM is also invested in Advantech – behind technology rolled out in China to monitor mask wearing and temperatures of people in public places. SCM was co-founded by Mr Rees-Mogg in . His office declined to comment last night.  The firm is managed in part via the tax havens of the Cayman Islands and Singapore. In November the Sunday Mirror revealed SCM traded shares in a firm fined for its role in the  Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. It also had holdings of £million in a Russian bank suspected of helping the annexation of Crimea and pro-Putin terrorists in the Ukraine.

That is why it is important that we reach them appropriately - it may be that some of the messages and some of the channels we have used have not reached some segments of the population. It may be that young people feel that they are less likely to be affected and less likely to be infected.Images posted on Twitter showed crowds of people in London Fields and Battersea Park in the capital, with some seen sunbathing and others on hire bikes.Brockwell Park in south London will be closed on Sunday because so many people had flouted the Governmentaposs social distancing advice, Lambeth Council said. It tweeted: Despite clear advice, over , people spent today in Brockwell Park, many of them sunbathing or in large groups. This is unacceptable.

But people must at every stage respect these guidelines because that is the only way of making sure we restrict the spread of the disease.

But he did not hesitate to join , retired NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline. After  years saving lives, Dr Saadu, , lost his own last week at London’s Whittington Hospital after contracting Covid-. The surgeon’s son described his dad as a “living legend”. And that is true of all those putting their lives on the line to tend to the sick and dying. All are living legends. They battle an invisible invader with too little testing of their own health and not enough personal protection equipment to keep them safe. Their willingness to cobble together kit from whatever they can find is inspiring, shaming and humbling in equal measure. Inspiring, because it shows what can be achieved in adversity. Shaming, because, as a rich nation, we should have done more for them. Humbling, because they carry on regardless. Dr Saadu was not the first medic to die of this nasty, creeping disease. And tragically he will not be the last. Behind doctors, nurses and paramedics, a whole army of NHS workers are also toiling round the clock. The hospital porters, cleaners and caterers, the drivers, the volunteers, the maintenance and admin staff. Alongside them are the key workers who keep our nation ticking over in these perilous times – the shelf-stackers and shop assistants, the posties, truckers, delivery drivers, refuse collectors and utility workers. And the , selfless helpers who stepped forward to ensure the old and vulnerable are not forgotten. Thursday, pm, is proving itself a moving moment as a grateful nation unites to honour them. We reach out to each other in the only way social distancing allows – by putting our hands together. The response of our country to this calamity has been truly astounding. Even those twiddling their thumbs at home are doing their bit by staying there.  Astounding, too, is the response from Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm founded by House of Commons lounge lizard Jacob Rees-Mogg. While Britain has all eyes on a multiplying virus, these virulent fatcats can see no further than multiplying pound signs. While millions face being struck down by Covid-, SCM delights in a “once in a generation opportunity” to make millions by cashing in on the crisis. If Mr Rees-Mogg had an iota of honour, he would disown these grubby profiteers. A politician of real integrity would now sever his links with the company altogether. He may be worth millions, but in the coronavirus stakes his value falls far short of a doctor or nurse. It is their skill and dedication we rely on now to save our lives.

I am living proof that you’re never too old to do anything. Nor is it ever too late to change your le. I was  years old when I discovered yoga. Before that I’d been living a glamorous le as cabin crew for British Airways. Travel was rare and expensive back in those days, you had to be very wealthy to fly on planes, so it was quite amazing. I loved it. But a rubbish rule back then was that, when you got married, you were no longer eligible for the job. I met my husband three years in and we went on to have two children and moved to Scotland as a family. Well, what a lestyle change! I didn’t know anybody and felt quite lonely with two small kids, so I decided to explore what was going on in the local area. There were two things – curling and yoga. Curling to me looked way too much like sweeping up, so I booked onto yoga, having no idea what it was. When the teacher turned up I was in awe. She was in her early s and just looked fantastic. She was so flexible and could do everything with ease and total vitality. I thought, ‘Whatever she’s doing, it works.’ I was exhausted and stressed with the children and the move when I walked in, but when I left I felt so much lighter. I couldn’t stop thinking about how effortless my teacher made it look. I was hooked. My teacher went on to inspire me, but she was very strict. Posture had to be perfect, she discussed anatomy and physiology with us, and we were expected to really know our stuff. She was an incredible teacher. After a year I decided I wanted to be a yoga teacher. In  I started my three-year course, getting stronger with each session. Now, it wasn’t easy.  I genuinely thought I was quite flexible after all these lovely skiing and surfing lessons I’d been lucky enough to have during my time with BA, but I was stf as a board when I started my training course. Now I know that’s been an advantage in my career –I can do it, anyone can. My first class was a complete accident and I wasn’t prepared. My teacher called in sick and asked me to step in. I managed to do it, but realised how dficult it was to explain things. However, after a while, when I saw some people struggling and I managed to help, I completely forgot about myself. Yoga is absolutely the best thing for your mental health, in my opinion. With all the dismal things going on around us, it teaches us to train our minds and focus on things we are grateful for and practise blue-sky thinking – things that we really want to happen. But it’s also a lot better in terms of physical exercise than people may realise. It tones, it helps joints, it strengthens your bones, helps your breathing, helps your heart and rids you of any tension. Whatever your ailment, I have a pose for it! Oryou want to come to a class and just lie on the mat, that’s fine too. It’s important to give our bodies what they need. Nowadays, yoga is very trendy, but back when I started it was known by so few. My classes became so popular that a journalist from The Daily Mirror called me up and invited me in for an interview on this new ‘craze’ back in .  From that the Mirror asked me to do a fitness video. It sold for £. and sales went through the roof! I couldn’t believe it when I was invited on morning telly to teach live yoga. My whole le changed. I’d be getting my shopping and people would say such nice things. They’d ask, ‘How did you do that one ’ and I’d give a live demonstration in the fruit and veg aisle. People are very kind, aren’t they  So I’m always happy to help. After that I went on to make  videos, which have sold millions worldwide. The most popular was The Age Free Body . I do believe that, as long as you go carefully, youthfulness is an attitude. There is no reason why those in their s and s can’t practise yoga. All you’re doing is gently working on your body and training it to a state of perfect health. It’s also judgement-free exercise, because no matter what level you do, it keeps you healthy, so it doesn’t matter what anybody  thinks. As for me, I practise yoga every day for about an hour by myself, and I am very conscious of my diet. I’ve always been fascinated by nutrition. As a war baby, all we thought about was food. Then everything was rationed until I was about aged seven, so food wasn’t consumed greedily, we just hoped we had enough to eat.  I once saw a doctor who explained that so many people on medication could be helped through pure, natural food and I tried it for a week. I’ve never changed my diet in  years. I eat fresh fruit, fresh vegetables, a little cheese, chicken, fish, milk, but skip all junk. No sweets, cakes, puddings, and instead I just eat fresh beautul food. The only sugar I have now is figs. They are rather lovely and I love a couple after dinner. I even swerve birthday cake. I know it sounds awful to say I haven’t had a slice of cake for  years, but it’s true. It’s not depriving myself, I just love my diet and how it makes me feel. I never drink alcohol. I used to have the odd glass of fizz as cabin crew and hated how it made me feel. But I feel great, quite honestly, and touch wood I’ve never been poorly. That’s not to say that diet goes hand in hand with yoga. People shouldn’t feel miserable about their bodies. You can be bigger and flexible. Often those new to exercise feel scared about taking the first step, but I make them realise that no one is perfect.  It’s lovely seeing clients encouraged when the person next to them can now do a pose they could never do. They’re always happy for each other. I love to help people start feeling proud of themselves again. I live in London with my husband and still teach  times a week. My oldest lady is  and she’s been with me for  years. What a lovely le I’ve been able to have all through my hobby. My family have adapted well to my fame. They see ft cut-outs of me in shops next to my DVDs and say, ‘Hello Mum’. If you’ve never tried yoga, you’ll finish your first class feeling like you’re walking on air. It’s never too late to change your le and you never have to slow down.

Despite high visitor numbers to parks and beaches suggesting fatigue may be setting in, Brits have been warned to be ready to hunker down for the long haul, as cases of the deadly bug could keep rising for another two to three weeks. Despite hopes that drastic social distancing measures will soon flatten the curve of the Covid- pandemic, Professor Paul Cosford, Public Health Englandaposs Medical Director, has warned that lockdown measures are nowhere near ending. Other experts, however, such as government adviser Professor Graham Medley of Imperial College London have argued that prolonged periods of lockdown could cause more harm than coronavirus itself, leading to soaring unemployment, food poverty, domestic violence and mental illness. So how long is it likely to last and who will decide when and how to end the restrictions  Follow the latest coronavirus updates here  When will the UK end lockdown  It is not yet clear when the UK will be able to lt its strict social distancing and lockdown measures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to review the measures for the first time next week, however when asked about an exit strategy at the daily press conference on Saturday, Michael Gove said: Thereaposs no fixed point, no specic date in the calendar at which we can say things will change, we are keeping them under review. One key government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months. Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said of the rules last week: Three weeks for review, two or three months to seeweaposve really squashed it, but three to six months, ideally, but lots of uncertainty in that but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal and it is plausible it could go further than that. This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but as a nation we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what weaposre all doing until weaposre sure we can gradually start lting ious interventions which are likely to be spaced - based on the science and our data - until we gradually come back to a normal way of living. What needs to happen before the lockdown can end  Ministers and scientists have been reluctant to say what requirements must be met before they relax the rules and are still emphasising the importance of social distancing. Business Secretary Alok Sharma has warned there could be another rise in casesthe measures are lted too quickly. He told a press conference on Wednesday: Whataposs also really important is thatwe stop these too quickly, there is a possibility that that massive effort people have made across the country is wasted and we could potentially see a dangerous second peak. We absolutely want to avoid that. One scientist has suggested that mobile phone data could help lt social distancing quicker by speeding up contact tracing. Prof Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: A combination of some social distancing measures, extensive testing and automated contact tracing could allow both a more regular social activity and a signicant control of the outbreak.  Who gets to decide when it ends  The decision to end lockdown in the UK will be made by the Government alongside scientists and doctors. When the measures were put in place last month, the Prime Minister said they would be reviewed every three weeks. Top NHS doctor Professor Stephen Powis said scientists are still focusing on learning how the illness works. He said on Saturday: It is very likely that this virus will become established in populations throughout the world and so we need a strategy to manage this over time, not just in the next few weeks or the next few months. Scientic knowledge about this virus is still being discovered. As we learn more about it, as the scientic evidence builds, that will allow those strategies to evolve. Professor Graham Medley, who is advising the government, has told The Times the shutdown is merely buying time and there is no clear exit strategy from the Covid- crisis. He said: This disease is so nasty that we had to suppress it completely. Then weaposve kind of painted ourselves into a corner, because then the question will be, what do we do now  We will have done three weeks of this lockdown, so thereaposs a big decision coming up on April .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email The lockdown has been tough for many and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that things are likely to get a lot worse before they get better.As the death toll hit , yesterday Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the public that staying at home was an instruction and not a request. While officials cannot answer how long we could remain in lockdown, it seems this could go on for months. But while there are of course a raft of things that are getting worse and suffering we are seeing many positives of being placed on lockdown.After a decade of austerity and four years of a nation torn in half by the Brexit debate, Covid- has reignited a sense of community in Britain.We do not know when le will go back to normal but as neighbourliness, nature and air quality resurges, Britons might decide they do not entirely want it to.  Here are some of the changes the Covid- pandemic might bring:Travel The lockdown has left the travel industry in a parlous state with thousands of planes grounded, trains and coaches suspending routes and a rapid drop in use of bus and local train travel. It has also revealed the extent to which technology has made a lot of business travel obsolete. AA President Edmund King told the BBC: People travelling up and down motorways just to hold meetings is inefficient, expensive and not good for the environment, he said. I think use of roads and rail and indeed bus will be reduced after this crisis. Work Many people lucky enough to have desk-based jobs have reported the transition from office-based to home-based working to be relatively straight forward. With the proleration of conference apps like Zoom and Skype, video conferencing and remote working is a lot more reliable than it once was, and could potentially open up the workplace to people previously shut out. James Taylor, head of strategy, impact and social change at disability equality charity, Scope, said: Businesses that work flexibly thrive, so long may this continue after the pandemic has faded. The average Britonaposs commute is around  minutes a day -  minutes in London - and post-shut down many will be sad to relinquish the extra few minutes in bed or a little more family time to be in the office for am. More people are likely to ask to work from home one to two days per week, easing pressure on the transport system and reducing stress among the workforce. Air quality One of the benefits of the shutdown has been a rapid increase in air quality in cities as cars sit idle, and hundreds of people have remarked on how clear the birdsong is without the rumble of traffic. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said in a recent interview that lack of progress on toxic air is the biggest frustration of his time in office, despite measures introduced to limit the most polluting vehicles.But the current change to the status quo might mean the Old Smoke and other UK cities are never quite the same again. A spokesman for the Mayoraposs Office said: Once the current emergency has passed, our challenge will be to do all we can to have cleaner air at all times which is why schemes like the Ultra Low Emission Zone and the further roll out of electric vehicle charge points will be vital. Demise of cash Cash is no longer king in this age of infection as people contemplate just how many hands their notes have passed through. Last month, the contactless limit was raised from £ to £ to allow shoppers to make larger purchases without having to punch their pin into a potentially dirty keypad.  While this is convenient for internet-enabled age groups and the salaried classes, it can spell dficulties for the elderly and those in the gig economy as banks shut their doors and ATMs are removed. Gareth Shaw, head of money for consumer advice group Which  warned that the move towards cashless, while well-intentioned, could hurt vulnerable groups - particularlyinitiatives like mobile bank branches are permanently withdrawn. Broadband Speedy internet has been a godsend for everyone stuck in doors.But internet black spots are still common in rural areas, with the situation so bad that Rishi Sunak pledged to pump £ billion into the rollout of full-fibre broadband in the latest budget in a bid to level up the UK.Councillor Mark Hawthorne, digital connectivity spokesman for the Local Government Association , said: We have long-called for funding and support to bridge the digital connectivity gap. He added: The LGA has previously called for a apossocial tarfapos to ensure a basic service is available at an affordable price to those most in need. Local shops Independent grocery shops have experienced an unexpected renaissance during the Covid- crisis in an otherwise bleak outlook for the high street.  While images of empty shelves and tales of month-long waiting lists for deliveries from major supermarket chains have taken over social media, most corner shops have kept calm and well stocked. Consumer intelligence company Springboard thinks it might mark a change in the way we shop. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: Now that they are once again familiar to consumers and being successful in delivering what is required, this episode may well provide a much needed catalyst for shopping locally and supporting small stores. Waste Now trips outside are strictly limited, many households are thinking of ways to make their shopping go that little bit further. There has been a proleration of articles on how to reduce waste and save cash in uncertain times, with Great British Bake Off star Nadia Hussain even teaching the frugal nation how to cook up banana skins. There is also the issue of what overflowing bins mean for our health as councils cut back on collection and recycling services.  Community After years of political arguments and ision, all of a sudden we are a nation dreaming up ways to help our communities. From clapping the NHS, hundreds of thousands of people signing up as crisis volunteers or just getting to know your neighbours, the past few weeks have been full of stories of solidarity. We could be in for a year of periods of greater and lesser social isolation as we wait for a vaccine to be developed and while it will be tough, this time of crisis is bringing us all together. Childcare Parents have found they are not only breadwinners, but also teachers and live-in entertainers for their children, placing a huge amount of stress on an already dficult situation. One head teacher at a primary school in Essex advises parents not to put too much pressure on themselves.  What this will show is just how much training teachers have to do their job, she said.

Instead it revealed a secret that would turn the -year-old grandad’s world upside down. It would show his father had not been a labourer from Hull but an American G.I. who had a fling with his mum and went on to become a D-Day hero. When Graham got the results of his sample from ancestry site MyHeritage saying he had a sister in America he ­assumed there must be a mistake. But when he began chatting to his DNA match Kitty Sala, , the truth about his father started falling into place. Kitty’s dad Harry Atwell Pittmann had been posted to England before the ­D-Day landings in June .  He had been briefly stationed in Graham’s native Hull in the February of that year – exactly nine months before his late mum Elizabeth gave birth. There was another shock for Graham, who has ten siblings. His past had not been such a secret to them. They revealed they’d known for years he was the product of an affair but had not wanted to upset him. In November Graham and we Ros, , travelled to Seattle, Washington, where he had an emotional first meeting with Harry’s family. They greeted him with a sign which read: “Welcome Home Brother”. Graham said: “I was always made to feel part of the family.” The Americans’ reaction had been a great boost to Graham after the emotional upheaval of the test results. He admitted his family tree research had been getting nowhere so he had sent off for the kit. He said: “When I logged in, it showed Kitty was a very high positive result – likely a sister or an aunt. Her two children were also strong matches – they came out as likely to be my nephew and niece. I said to my we, ‘This can’t be right. It’s saying I’ve got relations in the States’.” The shock set in after Graham spent a few days corresponding with Kitty. He said: “It seemed like a bit of a bereavement – thinking you’d lost everything you knew. My feelings were all over the place. “But meeting my American family was overwhelming. MyHeritage had arranged cameras, it was quite a moment. “As I went down the escalator to meet them all, I thought, ‘Woah’. But It was a fantastic meeting.”  Graham, who spent  years in the Army himself, was filled with pride when he was told his dad was a D-Day veteran. Harry was one of thousands of US soldiers who landed on the beaches of Normandy on June  – and saw dozens of his comrades shot before his eyes. Codenamed Operation Overlord, the largest seaborne invasion in history helped turn the tide of the Second World War and allowed the allies to advance into western Europe. By the time Graham was born in the November of that year Harry, then aged , had pushed into Germany – with no inkling he had a son in England. The dad of five, who died of bowel cancer aged  in , never got over what he’d seen on the French beaches. Graham said: “My siblings say he ­remembered the horric situation many of our soldiers went through on D-Day – getting off the beach, having friends shot on landing, or while just getting off the landing craft. “Like many of the guys, he suffered with that memory for the rest of his le. I feel very proud of him. It was quite a poignant moment when we went to the military cemetery where he is buried. “There are lots of similarities between us as we both spent years in the military. He was in the American engineers and I was in the British engineers. I feel sad that I didn’t get to meet my dad. “When you find out things like this, there are all sorts of questions you want to ask. He didn’t know I ­existed – the family sayhe did know, he would have come back. Luckily, I can speak to my brothers and sisters.”  Harry ed to the US when the war ended in  and married shortly afterwards, before having Kitty and her siblings Marsha, , Harry, , Sharon, , and Michael, . All of his children have marvelled at how much Graham looks like their late dad. When Graham probed his own ­family about the secret, they confirmed their labourer dad Arthur spent three years in Myanmar, then known as Burma, during the war. Arthur was posted in the country fighting the Japanese at the time Graham was conceived – meaning he could not have been his ­biological dad. Graham said: “I knew he’d served in the war – I’ve got his medals – but I didn’t give the dates any thought. “He was scarred as well when he came home. I don’t want to forget that. I asked my siblings, ‘Didn’t you even think to tell me ’ They said: ‘What was the point  You were our brother and you were part of the family’.

This is the excitement we’ll miss… In the Euro football tournament, Raheem Sterling would have broken both legs when the England players staged a jousting tournament to relax the day before the first game. But public pressure would have led to Gareth Southgate including him in the squad. Sterling would be in a midfield holding role, wheeled around on a tea trolley by Marcus Rashford. We’d still get to the first knockout stage, but lose on penalties to Portugal, when Harry Kane’s penalty was disallowed because it went to VAR, which decided he was French.  At Glastonbury, in the tradition of headliners being older stars such as Dolly Parton and Paul McCartney, top of the bill would have been the Queen performing a grime version of the national anthem, with guest star Stormzy.She’d surprise the crowd with an improvised chorus: “My crown jewels sparkle, my blood line’s patriarchal, but ma rude boy Harry’s gone wid his b***h Meghan Markle.” The Olympics would have begun with traditional massive anticipation for our big hopes. Then we’d hear the commentator say: “And so, it’s Davidson in lane five, for Great Britain. And they’re away first time and it’s a great start from Davidson, wonderful stride from Davidson, Davidson still running well and as they come to the line it’s DAVIDSON in sixth place, the winner’s some African bloke then a couple of Swedes but WHAT A RUN FROM DAVIDSON.”Eurovision would have been won by a Finnish grunge band called Satanic Death Cult, with their catchy melody I’m Losing it for Lucer. But an appeal would have been lodged after the drummer summonsed the Devil, who took away the Greek judge’s soul for awarding them nil points. My beloved Andy Murray would have worked  hours a day to be fit enough for Wimbledon after his latest hip operation. But he’d have found there was a mistake in his surgery, and he’d been given one of the hips the Queen Mother had removed  years ago but was still lying around.

Just like any other new baby, the little royal was issued a birth certicate with details about when and where he was born, as well as his parentsapos information. All birth certicates are a matter of public record, which means fans got to see it - and it revealed an interesting detail about his mum Meghan Markle. It lists her job description as Princess of the United Kingdom. But this left many fans scratching their heads, wondering why it said princess when Meghanaposs official title is Duchess. While she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband, Harry. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates. Some fans were also surprised to see that the name was listed as Rachel, with many unaware that this is her real name.  But her parents Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland have called her Meghan since birth, and all her of her friends use it rather than Rachel. It was also the name of her popular character in her hit legal drama Suits. Harry is also listed under his real name - Henry - on Archieaposs birth certicate. The document also revealed where Archie was born, despite Meghan and Harry hoping to keep the information private.  The Duchess gave birth at the private Portland Hospital in Westminster - which costs about £,. Portland is a celebrity favourite when it comes to maternity hospitals, with a whole list of A-list patients on the books.

Little Emmie Gizatullin from Colchester, Essex, was born with a one in a million genetic condition called Kniest Dysplasia, which is the rarest form of dwarfism and affects less than  people worldwide. The two-and-a-half-year-old went into total isolation with her mum Hannah Gizatullin, , and her brother Adam, , earlier this week to keep safe from COVID-. Emma is very vulnerable to infections and illnesses, while she also struggles with breathing, so any virus that affects the lungs, such as COVID-, could be fatal. Her father Marat, , is a fork lt driver and is still required to go to work - so the family decided it would be safest to isolate from him at Hannahaposs motheraposs house until things are back to normal. The loving dad still visits his family each morning by waving and blowing kisses through the window at a safe distance. Stay-at-home-mum Hannah said: I knew Emmieaposs condition would make her very vulnerable at this time. She been admitted to hospital three times in four months with simple illnesses such as croup, chest infection and an ear infection, so the slightest illness can make her very poorly. She cannot be intubated as her windpipe is too small, soshe were to contract COVID- it could kill her because she could not be put onto a ventilator.  I knew we had to do everything we could to keep her safe. We were self-isolating at home with Marat for one week but he was still going to work. It was making me very anxious. So Emmie, Adam and I moved in with my mum just over a week ago. Marat is at our home and visits every morning by waving through the window at a distance. I captured this moment between them and thought it was very special. Despite terrible obstacles there is still joy. Everyone has to do their bit to protect the vulnerable in our society. We are hating being apart and it hurts for Marat not to be with us, but we know we must do whatever it takes to protect Emmie. She doesnapost understand what is going on but even with the brief visits, she is so happy and overjoyed to see her daddy. You have to take all the smallest glimpses of happiness you can to get through these dficult times.  Three months after being born, Emmie was diagnosed with Kniest Dysplasia - a one in a million genetic disorder that affects bone growth and causes dwarfism, skeletal abnormalities and creates problems with vision and hearing. The tot has severe sight and hearing loss, she cannot stand and uses a wheelchair for mobility, as she has club feet and short, bowed legs. Due to a cleft palate that could not be healed, Emmie cannot talk so communications happen through British sign language. Despite being nearly three, Emmieaposs condition means she can currently only fit into clothes designed for six-month-old babies. Hannah said: Kniest Dysplasia can affect people in dferent ways. For Emmie, she has severe sight and hearing issues. She also needs a wheelchair to get around and uses sign language to communicate. The condition causes short limbs and short stature, so she is much smaller than other children her age. Hannah and Marat were over the moon upon discovering they were pregnant - but their joy soon turned to worry after their first scan, when doctors told them something was wrong.  The parents said initially they were warned that Emmie might have Downs Syndrome and at each scan were given more bad news - such as her having a small brain, heart defects, brittle bones and dwarfism. Hannah claims doctors even pressured them into having a termination - but the pair were adamant on keeping their baby, as they already aposloved and wanted her no matter whatapos. She said: We were over the moon when we found out I was pregnant and Adam was so excited to have a sibling. At the first scan, they told us there was something wrong. Initially the doctors said it was Downs Syndrome. There was alot of pressure to have a termination but we knew we loved her and wanted her no matter what. When the mum gave birth to Emmie, Hannah was told there would be palliative care in place as they did not think she would survive. But amazingly, Emmie grew stronger every day while in the NICU and went home after four weeks of intensive care. Now the aposhappy and cheekyapos toddler is loving le with her family and Hannah said she is always aposspreading joyapos by waving and smiling at strangers on the street. She added: It was hard as I had no ideashe was even going to survive being born.

The -year-old was about to set off an a gap year to see the world when her dad Bob suddenly died of heart failure on market day at only . Jo, who was then , rose early the next morning to check on the animals – and ended up scrapping her planned trip to step into Bob’s boots. Now she is one of Britain’s youngest farmers, running the -acre sheep, beef and arable business with some help from her mum and brothers. Home Farm in Allensmore, Herefordshire, will be featured in the new series of TV’s Springtime on the Farm, which starts on Easter Monday.  The land, which has been in the family for four generations, supports  Texel Cross Mule ewes plus this year’s flock of  lambs. There are also  pedigree Beef Shorthorn cows, young stock of the same breed and Angus Cross dairy-bred calves reared on milk powder. On top of all that Jo tends crops of wheat and oats as she works seven days a week,  days a year come rain or shine. Her mother Sally, , looks after the paperwork and helps out during lambing season.  And there is help when she needs it from brother Fred, , and half-brother Steve. Jo routinely puts in a -hour working day, which can go up to a gruelling  hours in the lambing season. She said: “There’s no such thing as a lie in – I’m up around am to feed the stock and check on them. Whilst most people my age are going out, a night out for me leaves me with a three-day hangover, so I don’t go much.”  Recounting how she came to take charge of the farm just over two years ago she said: “Dad was taking some ewes to market and he collapsed and died. “His truck and trailer were left in the car park so as soon as we left the hospital, I went straight to the market to pick them up and brought them home. That’s when I thought, ‘There’s a lot of sheep to look after here.’ “The next day I got up really early as I couldn’t sleep. “I went round all the sheep and made sure ­everything was OK and it just went on from there.” At the time, Jo was about to go to Australia and New Zealand for her gap year and had planned to work on a sheep station Down Under. She said: “It was always my dream to travel first then come back and work on the farm. But when Dad died I didn’t think twice. I needed to stay. “I was very lucky that Dad had taught me everything, we did ­everything together and shortly before he died he brought me into the decision making at the farm so we were already a team.” Describing her typical day Jo said one of her first tasks is suckling the lambs. She went on: “Then there is feeding and littering,the animals are outside, then I move onto ­haying and doing lots of jobs on the farm. “During lambing I can’t really sleep as I may be needed to help deliver themthey get into trouble. “It’s a very long day and when I took over the farm I ­committed to the sheep and this is my passion. “I wouldn’t change it for the world and I feel closer to Dad here.

Joanne, , is getting by on five hours’ sleep a night while the  of them rattle around their four-bed semi. But she insists the lockdown has brought them closer together and is “a special time”. She said: “It’s a weird time to give birth. There are no cards up and it’s heartbreaking that relatives can only meet him on FaceTime. “But we are so grateful he’s here and healthy. Our house might seem manic to other parents but, ­lockdown or no lockdown, it’s all about following a routine. “It’s easy to let the days trickle by and sometimes we get stressed and exhausted. But we are grateful for the opportunity for ­family time and make the most of it.”  The O’Rourkes began isolating a week before the lockdown took ­effect, over fears the virus could ­affect Joanne’s pregnancy. It means kids Mitchell, , Lauren, , Joe, , Ryley, ten, a girl of ten who cannot be ­named for legal reasons, Tommy, nine, Ashlee-Dean, seven, Freddie, six, Danny, three, and Neave, two, have been stuck in their home in Barnet, North London, for three weeks.  Joanne, a hairdresser, said: “The older ones struggled with the loss of freedom but understood why we were taking coronavirus seriously. “Babies could be born with all sorts of conditions and we were worried about extra risk.”  In the final weeks of her pregnancy, Joanne ­had midwe ­appointments at her GP surgery, where a “one in, one out” policy was adopted. Joanne was induced at Barnet Hospital on March  and their boy weighed in at lb oz the next day. She said: “Thankfully, Tommy was with me for his arrival and the staff were amazing. Though he had to leave soon after and none of my kids could visit.”  Hours after birth, the lad was whisked to intensive care over fears that he had a twisted bowel, then he was moved to London’s Great Ormond St Hospital in an ambulance. Joanne said: “I had to follow in a taxi because of social ­distancing. It was ­terrying. I felt so helpless.”  Tests were clear but staff at Barnet Hospital kept him in for another night, in case even tighter restrictions might stop him being re­admittedthere were more issues. Mum and baby have now been home for nine days – with Joanne breastfeeding as she and Tommy, , juggle home-schooling, chores and fun with the other kids. She said: “We get up at am and have breakfast followed by ­schoolwork on tablets or activity worksheets. After lunch, it’s ­leisure time – building dens, baking, football or ­painting pictures for the new NHS Nightingale hospital.  They go to their rooms at about pm. “The three youngest are with us and the others ­mostly in bunk beds.  “Lots of people would be ­negative and ask how they get enough inidual attention, and that it’s ­irresponsible. But when you see them they are happy.” Tommy, a forklt driver at BQ, does the £ weekly shop. And one of the big annoyances of the Covid- crisis is people ­mistaking him for a stockpiler because of his overflowing trolley. He said: “It’s frustrating when we are just buying enough to feed our ­family. There are three supermarkets near us and I have to go to all three every time I shop to get what we need.” The O’Rourkes get through six pints of milk, two loaves of bread, three packs of bacon, a box of cereal, a multipack of crisps and a whole toilet roll every day. Then there are the ingredients for the fresh meals Tommy cooks – ­using school dinner kit to make big batches. Joanne does four rounds of laundry a day and each child has a household task to complete. The couple even find time to run a YouTube channel about batch cooking and post to their , Instagram and Facebook followers.Incredibly, they admit more babies are “on the cards”. Joanne said: “I’d like one more but it’s not first on the agenda, especially in these times. Maybe when things go back to normal. We want to enjoy the ones we have first.” While most parents battle to keep kids from squabbling, Joanne insists having a large number at home is a “good thing”. She said: “It stops them getting bored because there’s always someone for them to play with. They get on well. The older ones help out with the little ones – whether it’s playing or a bit of reading. We have days when we get stressed but that’s just parenting.”  Recalling her fears ahead of the birth, Joanne said: “I’ve never gone to full-term with my other pregnancies but this time I was six days over. “I was freaking out and begged the midwives to induce me because the quicker he’s out, the quicker we can get home and lock the doors again.” Joanne says the atmosphere at Great Ormond Street is “strange”. “I was allowed to sit with him while they tested him but there was barely anyone around. I used that first day to try to breastfeed him, which I’ve never done with my other children.” Having already named seven boys, they are struggling to decide what to call their latest.

The mercury is set to hit C in the south east, with highs of between C and C in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. It’s going to be dry with some breeze in central and eastern parts of the country, with the weather becoming warmer in the afternoon. But despite the blue skies and balmy temperatures, Brits are under strict instructions to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Officials have been stressing that the blazing sunshine is not a valid reason to head to parks and beaches, and ahead of the weekend, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the nation that lockdown rules are an instruction and not a request. On Saturday, Lambeth Council announced that it would be closing Brockwell Park in south-east London today after it recorded more than , visitors, many of whom it claimed were flouting social distancing rules by sunbathing or gathering in large groups. Giving the latest forecast, Met Office meteorologist Steven Keats says that any remaining clouds in the sky will have cleared overnight, giving way to warm but some windy weather. “It means that Sunday we’ll be starting off with clear blue skies above much of the UK, and for the bulk of Scotland, Wales and England that’s how it will remain for most of the rest of the day,” he said. “The sunshine turns rather hazy at times, and that is as cloud pushes into the west affecting Northern Ireland primarily through the afternoon, with some splashes of rain. “Very windy in the west with gales around the coast but the winds are drawing up warm air from the south, so temperatures of - quite possible.” Next week could be even hotter, with forecasts predicting that the approaching summer could be one of the warmest on record. Temperatures could soar as high as C in the coming weeks thanks to a mass of hot air from Africa, which could last for three months. Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze added: It’s a Sunday roast with C and, after Monday showers, up to C is on the cards on Wednesday and Thursday. “Warm air is coming all the way from the north-west coast of Africa, with good sunny spells during the next week.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman left suicidal after ex","story":"NewsWoman left suicidal after ex stole intimate video of her and put it on PornhubEXCLUSIVE Twisted Tom Horwood shared the womans name, address and workplace online and even set up a fake Twitter profile saying she fantasised about being rapedShareByAmir Razavi:,  APR NewsHis victim had to change her whole le because of his appalling behaviour\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53301933-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53301933-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53301933-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53301933-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie neil doncaster ian maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/Corrie-Anderson-Featured-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"new affordable housing complex for arbroath approved by local authority","story":"A new affordable housing complex is set to be built in Arbroath after Angus Council granted planning permission.Fourteen #affordable# flats will be erected on an area of land at Mayfield Terrace in the town, each of which will be a one-bedroom unit.The application outlined that area of land at Mayfield Terrace is #within the Arbroath Development Boundary and is not allocated or otherwise identied for development#.It is also located within an established residential area and was previously the site of three-storey blocks of flats that were adjoining the row of shops south of the site. vw, px\"  It is proposed that the  flats will comprise of three blocks.Two, which will be located at the north and west of the site, will be made up of two-storey semi-detached blocks, providing four flats in each.The third block will be at the east of the site and will be a two-storey terraced style block that would provide six flats.Fishmonger announces free home deliveries as Arbroath chinese takeaway closes its doors\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp fishmonger-announces-free-home-deliveries-as-arbroath-chinese-takeaway-closes-its-doors embed # secretikfNNjqK\" data-secret\"ikfNNjqK\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The application outlines that #all blocks would have frontages facing out towards Mayfield Terrace and an inner courtyard with washing line enclosure would be provided in the centre of the site#,It is also detailed that #areas of open space would be provided at the sides and rear of the blocks and at the corners of the site#, which would see #nine new larger trees and a number of new shrubs provided throughout the site.# vw, px\"  Space for a total of  cars will also be provided #adjacent to the two semi-detached blocks andA supporting statement said the development would #add to the mix of property sizes in the surrounding area and access arrangements to accommodate the dfering needs in the local community are included in the design#.It was also argued that #the proposed dwellings would provide an acceptableThe flats which were on the land previously, stated in the application to to be  #  Mayfield Terrace, were granted a demolition warrant and were torn down in February .Whilst the site has re-generated in the intervening years to the appearance of an area of grassland, the ground survey supporting information indicates there is potential contamination issues with the land that would be #remediated as part of the proposed development.#In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

winners in a British International Championship match thanks to a Samuel Torrans own goal and John Taylor strike.Barret would go on to win just the one more cap for his country but wore the dark blue of Dundee with distinction  times.Born in Dundee on August ,  to Irish parents, he began his career at Dundee Harp – a club formed to try to emulate Celtic and Hibernian in providing a sporting focus for the catholic community in Scotland’s major cities.They had harboured ambitions to be the city’s top side before East End and Our Boys formed Dundee Football Club as we know it today in .In December of its first season, looking to bolster their back line, the Dee swooped for Harp keeper, Barrett.Their problems were clear for all to see as he became the fth goalkeeper the ‘Ten-bobbers’ used that season when he made his debut against Hearts on December .Barret remained at the club until the summer of  before signing for Newton Heath, now Manchester United, and went on to play against Dundee in a friendly – one of his  appearances for the Red Devils.Spells at New Brighton Tower, Manchester City and Aberdeen followed, before Barrett began to suffer from ill health, eventually passing away aged just  in .Hall of Fame inductee Longair, known as “Plum”, was a terric servant to Dundee – stretching back to the days of East End, for whom he signed in .The match against Ireland was Plum’s only cap in a career which also stopped in at Newton Heath as well as Sunderland, Burnley and Brighton United.Born in Dundee in , the centre-half would make  appearances for the Dee, scoring four goals and captaining the club in its first-ever fixture against Rangers in  – a - draw at West Craigie Park.Skippering the side is something Longair would do multiple times in his four spells until his retirement from playing in .He would go on to be the club’s trainer for their  Scottish Cup success and later become groundsman before his sad death aged just  in .It is estimated , people lined the streets for his funeral, showing the high regard in which the Dundonian public held him.Keillor was not only one of the first Dundee players to play for Scotland but also the first to score.Picking up four caps in total, the attacking talent also made  appearances for the Dark Blues, scoring  goals.Born in Dundee on October , , Keillor was brought up in Montrose and began his career with the Links Park side in .He joined the newly-formed Dundee FC in  with two Scotland caps already under his belt and, like Longair, played in the club’s first-ever match against Rangers.The outside-left was seen as a complete footballer with The Courier writing at the time that “he had a knack of rising to the big occasion”.And he did just that when Scotland hosted Wales at Dundee’s Carolina Port in , with Keillor getting his goal in a - win for the Scots.Keillor was awarded a testimonial against Celtic in , with , supporters turning up.He remained with the club until , playing at the new Dens Park alongside Longair, before ing to Montrose and hanging up his boots in .

The most important thing all of us can do is to follow the advice and stay at home wherever possible.”Dr Calderwood also said Thursday night’s Clap for Carers, which she took part in, was the first time she had cracked a smile “for quite some time”, adding: “I am very proud to be part of the NHS.“My NHS colleagues really appreciate it.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"helpful advice for students during coronavirus pandemic","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhether it is worry over money, exams, or family and friends – perhaps all three – the COVID- pandemic is a stressful time for students.While many will be at home with their families, and subsequently isolated from their natural peer support, many others will be unable to leave their student accommodation or indeed, in some cases, be unable toto their home country.Student services across the country are going to great s to communicate crucial advice and support, but it is incumbent on us all to help.Through the wonders of digital connectivity, isolation does not have to mean loneliness.Now is a good time to make that phone call, send that text or private message you’ve been meaning to send.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints. Keeping people safe must be the priority.Although it was an unusually sombre walk, we found time to laugh and see the funny side of things too. We have to live le, make the best of our time, and the times, we have.And when we can once again regularly venture into naturersquos wonders, what an extra special gt it will seem."},{"url":null,"title":"sleep-boost-prestonpans-youngster-charity-dad-supported-lends-hand","story":"Murray Scott, , liveswith broadcaster dad Mark,  mum Laura, , a supply classroom assistant at The Hub at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School and sister Sophie, seven, a pupil at Prestonpans Primary School.Murray, who attends The Hub in Tranent, has a partially deleted chromosome which affects his development and brain.The condition also affects Murrayrsquos spine and hips he is unable to walk or talk, is doubly incontinent and is tube fed.Murray also has epilepsy and reduced vision, and for the first eight years of his le was unable to sleep through the night.Mark said: ldquoHe was born with it ndash itrsquos a chromosome disorder which neither of us [mum and dad] carries.ldquoHe would have been  months when we got the diagnosis ndash at that point he was one of  [sufferers] in the world.Murray is described by his family as a ldquoreally happy, content wee boy, and ldquoreally good natured.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the industry that companies were ready to resume work as soon as possible.He said: ldquoThe approach to all aspects of the planning process is very much an emerging issue.ldquoThe authorities are working hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector that feels peaks and troughs very quickly.ldquoWhere public consultation is still proposed programmed, the only way to achieve this will be to set up a dedicated website with the ability to post comments.ldquoThe real challenge will be to ensure likely local residents businesses are aware and can gain access to participate."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-measures-supermarkets-taking-keep-people-safe","story":"Currently, item limit restrictions and priority hours are in place across all major supermarkets

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Over the last couple of days he talked of getting people back to work after Easter - a ldquobeautul timeline - at the same time as threatening to put New York, currently the worst affected state, into complete quarantine.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was relieved when the  trillion government support package his administration drew up was finally signed off. But based on what family and friends are telling us on daily calls, itrsquos going to take more than a one-off , cheque for low and middle earners for this to be anything other than a catastrophe for the worldrsquos richest country.The coronavirus trajectory is looking particularly ominous in the US, with its case rate the highest in the worldand a death rate that is already on course to outpace Italy.No country can escape the devastating effects of this virus, of course, no health service is not at risk of being overwhelmed. But as anyone who has spent signicant time there will know and understand, the US is a nation spectacularly ill-suited to a pandemic of this nature and magnitude. Even without the addition of Donald Trump.Indeed, the virus is already exposing many of US societyrsquos in-built weaknesses. Most fundamentally, the non-universal healthcare system that means millions of Americans have no way to pay for treatment should they become ill. Even those who do have medical insurance could find themselves with huge, le-ruining bills, depending on their medical history and policy exclusions. At a time like this, a complex, profit-drivensystem which links healthcare with employment status is particularly likely to fail.The notoriously ungenerous welfare system only compounds this. Many people will feel compelled to keep working rather than following instructions to stay at home. The additions to unemployment benefit announced in the support package are unlikely to provide much reassurance for those in this situation.Demographics is also key. Much of the interior of this vast country, including many of the southern states and rural areas, are poor and poorly resourced to a level that would astound many Europeans. If they are short of ventilators and hospital beds in New York, I dread to think what it will be like in rural Arkansas and Mississippi, where higher proportions of the population are elderly, infirm, unemployed and uninsured.But, as Mr Trumprsquos popularity in some of these places affirms, there are other fundamental issues at play. Many Americans distrust the very idea of the state, and their in-built inidualism may make them balk at the idea of having freedoms curtailed. They have no experience of the state having this much direct control over their lives, no experience in living memory of sacricing personal freedoms, as Europeans did during the Second World War. I note with concern that in some parts of the US there has been a rush on guns as well as toilet paper.This is also the most ided of nations, along political, geographical, economic and religious lines, which plays into a narrative of suspicion and rage. Only two weeks ago, while visiting the southern states, I spoke to people who believed coronavirus had been created by China in retaliation for US trade tarfs. Others talked of it being a plague sent by God to punish sinners.Even a well-run administration would have been up against it. As it stands, Mr Trumprsquos response, strewn with delay, contrary messages and personal insults, may already have cost lives.Despite the worry I feel for my American family, I want to end on a positive. I have no doubt the ingenuity, tenaciousness and \"can do\" attitude of people there, that other strand of the inidualism mentioned earlier, will play an important role in how the world tackles this crisis in the months ahead. On this front, I hope America continues to be the home of the brave."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-must-never-go-back-way-things","story":"Things need to change, and change radically.

Neither they nor we will achieve anything worthwhile until we know how our respective governments survive the present emergency., Trident. This should be cancelled. It is of no use against pandemics, terrorism or climate change, which are the real dangers facing us today. Spend the money on the NHS, conventional forces and much-needed surface ships., HS.

Now is the time.Angus Ferguson, Glasgow G.WE are in this lockdown situation at the moment and some of the information we are being given is indicating that it could go on for months. This is surely unacceptable.It would surely be possible to ask all businesses to come up with plans to get back to work but meeting the current rules of distancing. It would also be necessary to include rules about travel to work, but I am sure a lot could be done. One size fits all is not good enough. Many local shops employ people who can walk to work and could easily fit locks to doors to allow one or two customers in at a time. I think there would be many good ideas come out of this and it would not be impossible to monitor.I remember being on a course many years ago where one of the exerciss was to lay out a workshop meeting certain constraints and it was surprising the dferent solutions which came up.We must do somethingwe are not to face a situation where many businesses close, where debt is enormous and le is poorer for many.Jim McAdam, Maidens.NO doubt many studies will be done and many lessons will be learned from Covid- by all nations after it has been controlled as to what worked best, from containment to testing, PPE procurement to distribution to the frontline carers and beyond, to a cure.Every cloud has a silver lining and in this unprecedented case in tackling this pandemic, it seems many Government critics in the media have acquired - vision.If we have to prepare for every and any future eventuality, the same critics will be the first to question the unnecessary cost for something that may never happen.Trident is an obvious example of something no one wants to pay for, or use, but until all world powers agree to multilateral disarmament it acts as a costly deterrent.How many of the critics would leave their front door open and cancel home, car and le insurances It is one thing for the opposition to rightly hold the Government to account but another for the media to seek fault and apportion blame in retrospect. They too have a duty to report news rather than fabricate and create hyperbolic headlines for want of an original story. We should not need to work out fact from fiction depending on who the messenger is.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.IT would appear that following the latest briefings there are too many dferent priorities running in parallel, mixed messaging again. It strikes me that Government leaders are contradicting the medical professionals whom they claim they are following. While I do have to some sympathise with our elected leaders, this far down the line the glitches should have been sorted out.We are losing too many members of our society in the race to halt this deadly pandemic the Government has been too slow to respond swtly to the outbreak, but no we must we must focus fully as one to halt it.Iain Rowan, Largs.NON-PRIORITYconstruction works are currently still being permitted in England and only a few house buildershave so far voluntarily suspended works. According to Construction News, a leading publication for the building industry, there are many Scottish, and English, businesses who will be are under threat from their customers down south to come up with the materials, labour, and sometimes both, to satisfy their contractual terms or suffer the consequences.I can understand that the supply chain requires to keep in operation for essential works, but this is where both Governments need to get their heads together over the definition of \"essential\". As an aside, I worked in the building trade for  years and the two-metre rule is a total non-starter.George Dale, Beith.MIKE Wilsonwonders what might happen in a worst-case scenario of a post-coronavirus economic collapse.He needs to look no further than the data on the World Bank website.The old Soviet Union disintegrated in the early s, and the economy went into meltdown.

Because of the Swedish governmentrsquos very dferent strategy we will, in a couple of months, be able to answer the question whether the lockdowns in Britain and where were justied.In effect Sweden is providing a control and thus enabling us to take a scientic approach to judging the lockdown. On the one hand no new medication is licensed without undergoing extensive testing involving a control group and double blind testing. On the other hand, our Government has taken economy-crashing action on the basis of a computer model, albeit one created by epidemiologists.The damage to our economy is so extensive that we simply cannot move on without knowing whether the experts advice and the Governmentrsquos actions were appropriate.

New data shows their numbers are plummeting.The curlew, famous for its haunting and evocative call, has been particularly hard hit. Its population has dropped  per cent since .There are an estimated % fewer lapwings, while oystercatcher numbers have slumped by % over the past  years.Experts said the declines, recorded in the Working for Waders annual report, were partly due to the impact of modern agriculture and predators.And they have warned some species could disappear entirelyswt action isnrsquot taken. Now farmers, crofters and other land managers are being urged to team up and make their territory as welcoming as possible for the birds.Creating wader habitats by not draining wet areas in fields, introducing seasonal grazing to prevent damage to eggs or chicks, and controlling predators such as foxes are all steps that could help reverse the trend, said researchers at Scotlandrsquos Rural Collegeand Scottish Natural Heritage .And they have stressed changes can be brought in without removing productive land from use.Professor Davy McCracken, head of the SRUCrsquos hill and mountain research centre, said: ldquoSome actions can be win-wins for farmers, as they benefit both agricultural productivity and the waders.ldquoFor example, applying lime to improve soil pH can increase the abundance of invertebrates the birds prey upon.ldquoAnd, outwith the breeding season, cutting rushes provides the birds with access to those invertebrates across a greater area in any one field.He added: ldquoThe scale of loss has occurred over around  years so, on that basis,you take lapwings, wersquove lost around half of them over that period.ldquoIf we see the same scale of loss over the next  years, we would lose them completely.ldquoAnd the smaller the population gets, the quicker thatrsquos likely to happen.ldquo[It means] there are fewer birds to keep an eye out for predators coming in.Noting that waders are, historically, ldquoas much birds of farmland as of moorland,Mr MrCracken said the impact of modern agricultural methods had been signicant.ldquoThe habitat might have been intensively managed so therersquos more chance of machinery [disturbing a nest], or of livestock accidentally stepping in a nest, he added.Some land managers have already taken steps to boost bird populations.Bruce Cooper, estate manager at Glen Prosen near Kirriemuir in Angus, said he was shocked to see wading numbers ldquofalling through the floor.ldquoWersquore proud to have good numbers of curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers at Glen Prosen, but itrsquos not a matter of luck, he told the authors of the Working for Waders report.ldquoWe work very hard on predator control and habitat management to make sure we keep hold of these birds, and Irsquove no doubt that we would soon lose them altogetherwe stopped doing what wersquore doing.ldquoPredators can wipe out broods of young lapwings, and curlews can be very vulnerable when theyrsquore young.ldquoSo therersquos still time to reverse this and therersquos a lot that inidual farmers and crofters could do on their own land.But Mr McCracken stressed that working together would be vital to protecting Scotlandrsquos birds.ldquoItrsquos becoming clear that in order to be effective, wader conservation has to be rolled out across large areas, with collaborative projects involving multiple farms, estates and landholdings, he said.Working for Waders, which is co-chaired by the SRUC and SNH, has also created dedicated maps to show what activity is currently being undertaken to reverse the declining numbers, and where resources need to be targeted.Robbie Kernahan, Acting Director of Sustainable Growth at SNH, said: ldquoWaders are an integral part of Scotlandrsquos nature, and by working together, we have the best possible opportunity to help them thrive."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-virtual-kayaking-now-reality-small-business-owner-lockdown","story":"Being forced to close due to the coronavirus pandemic has been heartbreaking, but he is already thinking ahead and looking at ways to be ready when he can welcome people back to his Perthshire business.ldquoWhen I started my business I was told the first year was the hardest to survive, well that was until a pandemic came along, said Mr Gudan who runs Perthshire-based Outdoor Explore.ldquoWe have become an established brand in what we do which is offering tours and tuition for kayaking, biking and on foot in our area.

Any other component of the rainbow is readily available in vegetables and fruits.But producing a low-cost blue colouring safe for consumption has stumped experts for decades.Now an international team has come up with BeetBlue - after tweaking the structure of a natural antioxidant found in beetroot juice.Non-toxic and cheap, it will enliven clothes, furnishings, hair dyes and many other commodities and surfaces as well as food, they say.What is more, the plant pigment that gives beetroot its rich, purple-crimson colour is betanin - that has been shown to suppress the development of cancer.Corresponding author Professor Erick Bastos said: \"As far as safe, natural dyes with no metal content go, the colour blue has proven particularly tricky to pin down.\"BeetBlue dissolves easily in water and other solvents and maintains its colour in acidic solutions.\"His researchers used a chemical cocktail that increased the wave of light reflected by betanin which pushed it towards the blue end of the spectrum. The colour we see is a result of which waves are reflected back to our eyes.It offers an alternative to expensive blue colourants that often contain poisonous metals - limiting their scope, Prof Bastos said.What is more, beetroot has been hailed a superfood. There has been evidence it lowers blood pressure, boosts exercise performance and even prevents dementia.Prof Bastos, an organic chemist at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, explained: \"Beetroots are rich in betanin, a member of the betalain classof antioxidants.\"They are commonly used as additives to brighten foods with their yellow-orange or red-violet colours.\"But naturally blue betalains do not exist. So Prof Bastos and colleagues developed the new compound - and named it quasibetalain.Since the dye, described in Science Advances, is intended for human contact, they carried out a series of safety experiments.These showed it was non-toxic for live zebrafish embryos - as well as humancells grown in the lab.Prof Bastos said: \"The notion natural means healthy and safe to consume has increased the demand for natural colour ingredients for food, cosmetics and drugs.\"However, finding high performance and economically viable natural colourants is dficult, especially for blue hues.\"Blue mineral pigments inspired artists to represent the blue sky and waters, but despite their usual high stability, these materials are often expensive and contain toxic metal molecules that limit their broad application.\"Brightly coloured animals depend on the reflection or emission of lighttheir surfaces, he explained.Examples include the blue wings of the jaybird, the Common Blue butterfly, the feathers of the male Indian peacock and the hairs of the blue carpenter bee.Prof Bastos said: \"Since the natural blue colour of most living organisms cannot be easily harnessed, there is a quest for new blue chemicals that could be converted into coloured commodities.\"Blue natural pigments are rare, especially among plants, although there are highly evolved flowers that have blue-coloured petals to attract bees and wasps, which are red colour blind.These include the blue hydrangea, the cornflower, morning glory and speedwell, said Prof Bastos.To showcase BeetBlues potential the prototype was incorporated into cellulose, cotton fabric, yoghurt, hair and silk.Added Prof Bastos: \"Under magnication, a unorm blue colour distribution was observed, reaffirming the applicability of BeetBlue as ametal-free blue colourant.\"Beetroot was brought to Britain by the Romans. It is rich in fibre, combating constipation and lowering cholesterol levels too.The vegetable has been shown to increase the number of white blood cells, which are responsible for detecting and eliminating abnormal cells."},{"url":null,"title":"record-745m-wind-power-exported-scotland","story":"New official statistics show more than , gigawatt-hours was transmitted to England and Wales in , more than ever before.The net exports are so high they would have powered every home in the country for  months, the Scottish Government said.Scotland produces far more power than it needs - though forecasts suggest demand for electricity will soar as heating and cars switch away from fossil fuels.The new figures also showed that there were just  hours last year when Scotlandrsquos own energy supply did not meet demand - and it had to import from England or Ireland.This is despite the closure of the giant Longannet coal power station in .Imports during the less than six days when domestic output - including remaining nuclear generation - during those demand are up to but net exports are, nevertheless, also at an all-time high, of nearly , gigawatt-hours.The Scottish Government, in a statistical review, said: ldquoThe fact that Scotlandrsquos own supply is secure, and its abundant generation of electricity via wind means that Scotland has long been a net exporter of electricity.:Why it is feared Scotlands wind power economic boom is all hot airldquoIn recent years, imports have increased as well, rising from approximately  GWh in  to more than , GWh for every year since . This is possibly a consequence of the closure of the coal-fired power station at Longannet in , which has meant that there has been a potential need for Scotland to have non-intermittent electricity generation available.Power generators are currently looking at developing mass superbatteries to store wind and other renewable energy and overcome intermittent supplies.But even without them, low-carbon energy - including nuclear - was able to meet all Scottish demand three-quarters of the time in . That is up from just nine per cent of the time as recently as .Renewables alone met demand %time last year, up from nearly % of the time a year earlier and as little as % in .Scotland has a target of producing the equivalent of % of its electricity consumption from renewables by this year. The  figures put the country at %.Scottish Renewables, an umbrella organisation for the industry, still thinks the target can be met.It supports exports but also has an eye on the big prize: that domestic generation has to soar to meet new demand for electric cars and non-fossil fuel heating.Scotland has one of Europ s nest records on green electricity. However the countrys addiction to primitive gas boilers for inidual homes means it has the continent s worst performance on green heating.Cara Dalzeil, policy officer at Scottish Renewables, suggested growth had slowed down because of decisions made in London.She said: \"The % target is still within reach, but policy uncertainty in recent years has meant our industry has not been able to deploy as much renewable electricity generation capacity as predicted.: Scotland loses again in poundbn wind farm boom after ministers pledge action\"The growth of offshore wind has happened more slowly in Scotland than in the rest of the UK and onshore wind, which makes up the majority of our green power generation capacity, was locked out of the energy market by the UK Government for four years, meaning very few new projects were built.\"We are however now starting to catch up offshore, and onshore wind is once again allowed to access auctions to sell the power it generates. We remain confident that with the growth in generation this will bring, alongside contributions from other technologies like solar, tidal power and hydro, the % remains within reach.\"Scotland has another target: to get half of all energy - for transport and heating as well as current electricity needs - from renewables. The most recent figures, for , put that number at %.Electricity has a long way to catch up with fossil fuels in Scotland. The latest energy release says the country produces  times more primary oil than primary electricity, when converted in the kilotonnes of oil equivalent.Meanwhile, net electricity exports may be growing fast but they have a long way to go to rival oil and gas.Scotland exported pound. billion worth of those two commodities in , a % rise in cash terms since the year before and the highest since .

How  By learning another language.To be fair, thousands of people in lockdown have figured this out. A lot are dusting down old textbooks or downloading the phone app Duolingo.But can you really learn to speak \"foreign\" without leaving your house  Can your children  Can you or your family refresh or improve existing skills.: How to help your teenagers through lockdownThe short answer is yes ndash thanks to the internet and its incredible resources, especially teachers using Skype, Zoom or other video links.But there are lots of potential pitfalls. Some are specic to the lockdown. And some less so.I have made all the mistakes it is possible to make when learning. So, after taking advice from people smarter than me, here are my top tips for \"lockdown language\".Pick the right language for youFirst, a word of warning. Some people are going to have tremendously strong opinions about what you study. Sometimes they are just enthusiasts for a language or culture, say a passionate Italophile. Thatrsquos great. But remember what works for them might not work for you.Sometimes self-appointed experts focus on what they imagine is right for the country and the economy and not for you. ldquoPah, they will tell you, ldquowhy are you learning Icelandic when there are a billion-zillion Chinese and just a couple of hundred thousand Icelanders This is dumb, really dumb.My tip  Always start with a language that is relevant to you, that you know you will use ndash and therefore not lose.Soyou happen to hike up volcanoes in Iceland every summeror have a boyfriend from Reykjavik or a passion for the sagas, then why not learn to speak like our Atlantic neighbours  Butyou, for instance, do business in Shanghai, practise a bit of kung fu or are fascinated by calligraphy, then maybe think about Chinese.But it really important to \"click\" with the language you are learning. If you canrsquot make up your mind, try out some first, see what fits you.Maybe lug in to some languages before settling on just one. Watch a French or Polish movie or listen to some Italian opera or Brazilian pop, MPB. Try to mimic the sounds.Or take a sampler lesson. You can get one for as little as  an hour online. That takes me to my next top tip.Hire a real teacher or go to real classes ndash online.Remember how you learned the language yoursquore reading now  First your parents ndash probably mostly your mum ndash taught you how to speak. Then at school teachers expanded your vocabulary ndash and with it your world.Learning a language is visceral, itrsquos physical, itrsquos kenetic and itrsquos social. Itrsquos about making unfamiliar sounds with your mouth and recognising them with your ears. You need someone to correct your mistakes as you go along, just as your mum did when you were a baby. You canrsquot teach yourself. Donrsquot waste time trying.I am a big fan of group classes. This is where you learn from your mistakes ndash and those of your peers ndash and you have fun doing so.But this must be impossible when you canrsquot leave the house  Not at all. A number of big providers, private schools, have flipped online using digital tools like Zoom, with the same kit you may be using to stay in touch with friends and family ndash a phone or a laptop.Desperate schools on the European mainland ndash including really prestigious ones ndash are offering a week of intensive lessons, three hours a day in a virtual classroom, with learning materials sent by PDF, for less than the equivalent pound a week. Some are offering three weeks of tuition for  euros.Some Scottish schools, such as Lorca Spanish, are continuing their classes online ndash you canto the classroom when the bug clears.What about private lessons  These are great too, though harder work for learners and teachers. They also tend to be more expensive.However, there are websites such as Italki where language teachers are offering personalised classes for adults and children, often for as little as  an hour with taster lessons for less.:Ron McKays Diary: Lockdown advice, drugs warning and a special anniversaryGillian Campbell-Thow, the languages guru for Glasgow schools, rams this message home: \"Maintaining your oral proficiency is key and you need to talk. End of. If you canrsquot get to your class or meet up group ndash get on a  that you can see people face to face and start the conversation. Many language schools are moving to web-based lessons ndash you cannot beat having a real person to talk to. You wont get that kind of immediate help and support from an app!!Immerse yourself in your chosen languageYour home might be in Scotland ndash but it does not have to be that way.If you are an early learner why not label everything and every room in your house with post-it notes of their name in the language you are trying to pick up.Donrsquot be ashamed to talk to yourself. Vacuuming  Whatrsquos a Hoover in German  Or Urdu  Say it out loud. And not just once.Making dinner  Why not look up a recipe in the language yoursquore learning on YouTube Listening to radio as you cook  Tune in to the country where your language is spoken . Or try some of the amazing content on the catch-up services of the European equivalents of the BBC, including material designed for children or foreigners. France Culture has a whole \"pedagogical series called Nation Apprenante RAI Radio  has Italian classic novels as audiobooks Germanyrsquos Deutsche Welle has free lessons for foreigners at all levels.Binging Netflix or Amazon after dinner  Look at the language settings. You might find your favourite show comes in Spanish or French or Arabic, which subtitles to match. And there are plenty of box sets from around the world to let you put your new or old language skills to test while relaxing on your sofa.Want to socialise  You can do that at home too. Conversation groups ndash meet-ups in cafes and bars for people who want to practise their languages ndash have not shut down, they have just gone online.Yakety Yak, a Scottish business which normally arranges chats in cafes in Glasgow and Edinburgh, says its Zoom events are working well. So much so that it is thinking of continuing them after we get the all-clear.Gaming  PlayStation and other consoles have language controls so you can play in the language you are learning or refreshing.Donrsquot rely on games, apps or other gimmicks ndash but donrsquot ignore them eitherThere are some fantastic new tools for learning foreign languages. But I think they should be seen as supplementing real lessons, not replacing them.It is easy to scoff at games like Duolingo ndash an app with a green bird that has simple beginners lessons with some often surreal vocabulary.Duolingo has proved really popular in Scotland as a way of giving users some familiarity with Gaelic ndash but, of course, no in-depth knowledge. And ndash as a way of relaxing after real lessons ndash it might be worth a try.Podcasts are also no alternative to real teaching. But, my goodness, they can be a great resource. There is a small Scottish firm called Radiolingua which produces short ldquoCoffee Breakpodcast lessons in a whole iety of languages. Check them outyou are a beginner of intermediate learner.Donrsquot think of beginners level as easy and advanced as hardOK, yoursquore stuck in the house and you canrsquot go to a class. So yoursquore tempted to just teach yourself the \"basics\" of your chosen language, because they are easy, right  Wrong!Beginnerrsquos level is where so many Scottish language learners screw up.Itrsquos hard to replicate the sounds of another language. It is worth trying to get it right from the start. Otherwise, to make headway you have to unlearn all the ugly noises you have hard-wired in to your brain when you thought you were rehearsing \"easy\" basics.:Nature reminds us that this lockdown limbo wont last foreverThe good news  Advanced does not mean hard. Learning a language is a marathon, not a sprint. Like a long-distance runners, you will hit walls, but itrsquos not always easy to say when.Focus on talking and listening more than on reading and writingAnother peril of self-teaching ndash or even Scotlandrsquos traditional approach to modern languages ndash is that it ends up becoming very focused on the written word.So, especially,you are a beginner, try to work most on your oral and aural skills, rather than written screeds. Campbell-Thow says: ldquoWriting an essay isnrsquot going to get you what you want in a restaurant or get you out of trouble.This is especially true for your primary-aged kids.Keep a wee wordbookSet yourself a target of learning  words or phrases a day, jotting them down on a notepad and checking yourself every morning. Some people find it helpful to break new vocal in to themes. But keeping going over this book.Campbell-Thow adds: ldquoDonrsquot be frightened to write beside it how it sounds to you.Donrsquot worry about making mistakesThere is nothing wrong with getting something wrong. Just laugh it off. After all, saying accidentally funny things might just be what we all need in these dark times.How to teach your kids a language ndash by Gillian Campbell-ThowThe trick for language learning with wee ones is to remember how children learn their mother tongue ndash they need lots of aural exposure to language and lots of repetition. For primary-age children we need not focus on the reading and writing but lots of talking, listening and intercultural awareness.bull Start with music ndashyou can sing it, you can say it. Use music from films that wee ones might recognise such as nursery rhymes, Disney films etc ndash they already know the tune and now they need to hear a dferent meter of words. Donrsquot overthink the listening, just let them hear it and keep it on a wee loop.bull Get into watching familiar cartoons as well ndash most cartoons will be available in other languages ndash again same context just dferent languages. It doesnrsquot make it so strange.bull Use BBC Class clips for more educational input and intercultural awareness.bull Short clips are great as there is plenty of audio visual stimulus. Try and stay away from the words in the first instance ndash children will use mother tongue pronunciation rules and thatrsquos when mistakes can get embedded.bull Lots and lots of listening, talking and singing ndash so any chance there is to interact, talk and play along with others is great.Gillian Campbell-Thow is curriculum leader for Modern Languages and Gaelic, Glasgow City Council________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing.

If the world hadnrsquot bolted its doors and entered coronavirus lockdown, Fynn Donaldson and more than a dozen pals, fresh from leaving school and with feet still sore from dancing at the end-of-term prom, would be on the beach by day and hitting the clubs by night.ldquoIt should be the summer of her le, says her mum, comedian and writer Jojo Sutherland. ldquoInstead, wersquore at home playing cards and board games.ldquoShe has lost her senior show, the prom, the last day of high school with her friends, her exams. They are all experiences that she will never get back things that Fynn and her friends looked forward to since day one at high school are gone, and thatrsquos hard.Across the Forth from -year-old Fynnrsquos South Queensferry home Eve Gill, , is in lockdown in Cupar, Fe, also trying not to dwell on what should have been.She has trained for a year alongside specially selected teenagers from her school, Bell Baxter High School, for what should have been a le-changing km trek across East Greenland. Instead of heading off earlier this week for the once-in-a-letime Polar Academy adventure, she is stuck inside doing  push-ups a day in an effort to stay fit and trying not to succumb to frustration and negativity.ldquoShersquos been upset and disappointed, says her mum Moy. ldquoTherersquos the anxiety of what is going to happen with her exams too.ldquoTherersquos something about the consolidation and clarity that comes with sharing a year or tworsquos work with someone other than her teachers that is not going to be there.While painting rainbows and watching Disney+ movies might get parents with young children through, lockdown for parents of teens has become a delicate balancing act of avoiding saying the wrong thing ndash impossible at the best of times ndash tiptoeing around unpredictable hormones and fighting over why they mustnrsquot go out to meet their friends.For those trying to stop stroppy older teens used to independence from leaving the house, and others fearful that their youngsters may slide into deep anxiety, stress and even depression, the added pressure of the current crisis means the stakes are even higher.The stress and anxiety of coronavirus, cancelled proms, scrapped exams and separation from friends comes against a backdrop of heart-breaking statistics that show young peoplersquos mental health is more fragile than ever.Last year, more than , young Scots needed mental health treatment from the countryrsquos  health boards: a rise of almost  since . Worryingly, more than  children and young people waited over a year to receive support through from health board mental health services.It means that for parents of teens, it is going to take a bit more effort than a Joe Wicksrsquos am workout and baking a Betty Crocker cake to get through whatrsquos ahead.At home in the shadow of the Forth Bridges, Jojorsquos daughter Fynn should have been preparing for five Highers, hoping for the right grades to study politics and international relations at either Dundee, Stirling or Aberdeen University.ldquoFynn has been emotionally down in terms of looking at the things shersquos not now going to experience, says Jojo.ldquoShe plays volleyball for Scotland and had been looking forward to going the European Championships in Iceland in June. She normally trains three or four times a week physically, shersquos like a caged animal.ldquoOne advantage is that her generation communicates online anyway. Theyrsquore doing stupid dances and messaging each other just like before and she still feels connected to her mates.Unlike smaller children who may not fully grasp the seriousness of the situation, she points out that older children canrsquot be easily distracted or fobbed off.ldquoYou canrsquot bullsh** teenagers and say everything is going to be fine. They read the papers and see the news and know whatrsquos going on.ldquoShe seems okay, but I worry because mental health problems, depression and anxiety are much more prevalent among teenagers these days.According to parenting expert Laura Erskine of The BabyDoc Club, guiding teens through this crisis needs a particularly delicate touch. ldquoThey are looking at news and social media, they are glued to their screens in their rooms and they know whatrsquos happening.ldquoWe need to get them out of their bedrooms, into a family space and find new ways to do things with them.Talking to them directly about their feelings could backfire, she warns.ldquoTeenagers donrsquot want to sit down and talk about stuff thatrsquos worrying them with their parents. They want their peer group.ldquoInstead of asking them straight about their feelings, ask about their friends or say start a conversation by saying yoursquore aware someone you know has a son or daughter thatrsquos struggling a little.ldquoTeenagers are very self-centred and believe the whole world revolves around them. But their feelings and worries are all valid.For parents of older teens, therersquos the challenge of trying to prevent headstrong young adults from wandering out to secretly meet friends.Jojo, who has three other older children, says: ldquoFynnrsquos been good, but I think a few kids in the area have been a bit naughty. Itrsquos going to happen.ldquoBut her attitude iseveryone studiously stays at home, this will pass quicker.Although they donrsquot know each other, both Fynn and Eve are taking a pragmatic approach to lockdown.Fynn hasnrsquot yet completely written off the possibility of a summer break with her pals Eve, who was due to sit seven National s, is focusing on next April when Polar Academy adventure with nine other students from her school is now due to take place.ldquoI was gutted that it was postponed, she says. ldquoBut Irsquove come to terms with it now.ldquoWersquore all being positive for each other.Case study: Le with the WilsonsCharlene Wilson, a press officer from Clackmannanshire, has teenage daughters, Cha, , and Megan, .ldquoOur girls are finding things quite tough, she says. ldquoTheyrsquore at a challenging age with their hormones affecting their emotions and are mostly struggling with not being unable to socialise.ldquoThey do chat on WhatsApp and Zoom but itrsquos not the same as having that human interaction.The prospect of missing birthday treats next month, not being able to see grandparents and family, and fears their plans to see Lewis Capaldi at Trnsmt may be scuppered, have been hard.ldquoIrsquom missing seeing my friends and even missing seeing my teachersIrsquom honest, says Cha. ldquoI feel very cut off from people which isnrsquot nice.ldquoWe are hearing the news every day about coronavirus and how more and more people are affected and dying, so that is quite upsetting.Sister Megan is also finding lockdown hard. ldquoI mainly miss seeing my friends.

Itrsquos going to be a bit scarier this time to leave the safety of my isolation.Things have changed a lot across the UK in the past week. What wersquove been seeing in Italy and Spain and, more recently in New York, is unfolding right on our own doorstep. We knew it would, but still the realisation that this is happening here is really quite mind-numbing.Only a couple of weeks ago there were positive things we felt able to grasp at. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Cabinet team were resolute and confident when they spoke of preparation, of learning from other countries and of ldquogetting through this with a unity of spirit and co-operation.It was perhaps too easy then to be too confident that wersquod get off lightly compared to others. It is perhaps too easy now to become too worried that everything is teetering on the edge of collapse.Even the BBC headlines canrsquot help themselves from being tabloid. The subject matter is more akin to a science-fiction movie than a mainstream news bulletin.Infection rates soaring and death rates alarmingly high millions of jobs lost as companies shut down health systems on the verge of collapse body removals on an industrial scale from New York hospitals heavily armed vigilante groups in the US prepare for a breakdown in law and order.The tremors of fear infiltrating our every sense can seem very tangible ndash but we have almost certainly gone too hastily from glass half-full to glass almost empty.I know there are few things any of us have gone through that can directly compare to what is happening right now.But with so much time to ponder and muse ndash and worry and reflect ndash I canrsquot help but think Irsquove been in the blackest of holes before only to realise some time later that things werenrsquot as bleak as I had thought they were.This time last year I quit my job as director of communications with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde after falling victim to a cruel and costly financial scam that saw me losing my le savings. .My plan was to launch my own business and work like crazy to recoup what I had lost, but there was a bend in the river I never saw coming ndash and that was being diagnosed with lung cancer two months after launching the business and just as I started to secure contracts.I also remember many years ago scribbling on a bit of paper just how wealthy Irsquod be by the time I was  and my endowment mortgage matured.

They are three times more likely to experience a chronic health condition such as asthma and COPD.#As the weeks and months continue, we know that the increasing pressures on the economy, and people losing their jobs could mean a rise in people being forced into homelessness too.Scotland has long been a world leader in its approach to tackling homelessness and it is good to see the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to giving people somewhere safe to live at such a time. But, while itrsquos absolutely right that everyone has been supported into hotels, it is important to remember that this is a necessary emergency response to the pandemic ndash itrsquos not a long-term solution.The speed at which people have been housed should give us much hope that homelessness can absolutely be ended. In a matter of weeks, everyone who needs somewhere to live ndash including those with no recourse to public funds ndash have been given self-contained accommodation, and they have access to healthcare, food and the extra support they need.This makes the case loud and clear that there is no need for people to be sleeping on our streets.The people we speak to living in hotels tell us theyrsquore grateful for being able to have a proper bed, soap and access to three meals a day, but the fear among some is abundantly clear. With no end in sight at the moment to this current crisis, the lack of information as to how long people will be able to stay in their rooms is understandably concerning.One major concern is what will happen to those people who are homeless and have no recourse to public funds because of their immigration status. It is great that they now have self-contained accommodation ndash but therersquos still a huge need for extra support to be put in place, such as providing information about the pandemic and what it means in their own language, or translators being made available.As the barriers that were once in place to finding someone a safe and settled home ndash like low levels of housing benefit ndash are being lted in light of the outbreak we are seeing more options open up. Frontline staff at Crisis are noticing increasingly numbers of affordable properties in Edinburgh, meaning that we have more opportunities to move people into safe, stable housing. We must not see these obstacles reinstated ndash the Scottish Government must work with Westminster to ensure that when the pandemic subsides, we are left with a proper welfare safety net.It shouldnrsquot have taken a pandemic to prove we can end rough sleeping across Great Britain ndash and we shouldnrsquot use the end of the crisis, when it comes, as an excuse to go backwards.Grant Campbell is director of Crisis Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-join-international-effort-revive-africas-superfoods","story":"For generations of Africans, they were the ldquobare necessities ndash small crops of odd-shaped, strange-tasting fruit and vegetables such as prickly pears, edible roots, leaves and seeds provided nutritional sustenance and played a vital role in their diet.But as Western influences emerged, precious native crops like bitter yam, sweet bush mango, chocolate berries and horned melon were overtaken by belly-filling maize, wheat and rice.Now scientists from Scotlandrsquos Rural College are among an international team looking at ways tolargely forgotten ldquosuperfood crops to African tables, in an effort to help offset deeply worrying levels of malnutrition across the continent.More than  under-utilised plant species ndash known as ldquoorphan crops because they have been largely forgotten in the race towards fields of starchy wheat, rice and maize ndash have been included in the programme.Researchers will look at ways of using genomics to enhance their production and harvesting to encourage food producers, while new marketing techniques to make crops appear ldquocool will be introduced to encourage consumers to take advantage of their exceptional nutritional values.As well as helping to improve nutrition, the programme could help strengthen food production in the face of climate change and population growth: Africarsquos population is predicted to double to . billion people in  years, raising pressure on governments to deliver more food and better livelihoods.It could also lead to a wave of African ldquosuperfoods with exotic flavours and unusual textures being exported to Western markets.Dr Ian Dawson of SRUC, who is part of the African Orphan Crops Consortiumproject, said the crops were ldquoculturally important but had been displaced by alien crops such as maize, rice and wheat, introduced by Western influences.ldquoWheat and maize, for example, are very good at providing energy and have lots of starch, he said. ldquoBut theyrsquore not very good at providing the other range of nutrients that we need for a healthy diet.He added that farmers had often turned away from growing ldquoorphan crops despite their immense nutritional value, to meet rising demand for wheat, maize and rice.ldquoProduction of these culturally important crops has decreased or become restricted.ldquoIn some cases, the lsquoorphanrsquo crops are not regarded as particularly profitable to grow, while a move to a more Western diet, increased urbanisation and people eating more processed foods which are unhealthy but based on staples, has also had an impact on their production.ldquoThe project came from a recognition that there was a need to focus more on nutritional value and, in particular, producing better crops that farmers can grow.Malnutrition, or ldquohidden hunger, in many African nations, is linked to human underdevelopment, causing stunted growth among children, anaemia and obesity.Unicefrsquos  report, The State of the Worldrsquos Children, singled out South Africa in particular as facing a burden of malnutrition, under-nutrition, hidden hunger and obesity.It added that a lack of quality food put children at risk of poor brain development, weak learning, low immunity, increased infections and death.The plants chosen for the project are mostly indigenous to Africa. However, some ndash such as the tellingly-named elephant ears which originated in South America ndash are considered ldquoexotics.Elephant ears plants are popular in Puerto Rican cuisine, typically ground with squash, potato, green bananas and plantains, and mixed with pork and ham before being boiled in a banana leaf.Some plants included in the programme have recognisable names but have suffered from a lack of research into their nutritional qualities which could make them more attractive to farmers and consumers.They include tamarind, a large evergreen tree which produces sticky edible seeds similar to dates jujube, which produce crisp, juicy fruit rich in fibre and vitamin C and sour plums which, despite their tart taste, have a high potassium and protein content.Dawson said genetic enhancement of the crops included in the AOCC programme could help revive interest in the plants among Africarsquos largely female farming communities, who have particular interest in ensuring their families receive a quality, nutritional diet.ldquoCertain crops may not be very profitable ndash they might be hard to produce and there could be a lot of labour costs. Altering a plantrsquos architecture so it doesnrsquot fall over in the field or ensuring the seed or crop remains on the plant and doesnrsquot fall on the ground can make it easier to pick.ldquoMaking the fruit bigger can also make it easier to harvest, he added.ldquoOther genetics could enhance the processability of the crop so itrsquos easier to cook or easier to extract the seed from the plant so it can be incorporated into processed foods.He added: ldquoThere is an export market for some of these crops in a way that quinoa was a South American orphan crop and has now become popular in the UK.ldquoHowever, the risk is that nothing is left for the local people. So therersquos a need not to export all the good stuff.First, however, a major element of the SRUC input into the project is aimed at encouraging farmers and food producers to sht focus from Westernised diets to accept the traditional crops.That may require very Western-style marketing campaigns. ldquoTo have an impact and get crops to farmersrsquo fields, we need to do the genetic stuff but also promote the crops so we get consumers interested in eating them.ldquoOne way is to make these crops look really aspirational and lsquocoolrsquo, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"need-better-system-food-banks-says-pete-ritchie-nourish-scotland","story":"One of the first lessons wersquove had to learn in this crisis is that running out of food is not a problem of supply. Itrsquos a problem of distribution. poundbn worth of food that should be on the shelves is in peoplersquos cupboards and fridges, and too much of this will end up being wasted.Meanwhile, food banks up and down the country view the lockdown announcement with alarm. Will thevolunteers be allowed to leave their home to work in them  Will they get supplies from public donations or be able to buy them from the supermarket  Will they be allowed to stay open Therersquos no doubting the good intentions of the people who run and work in food banks. They have been picking up the pieces of ten years of austerity. But now, enough is enough.Itrsquos completely possible to give people money to buy food themselvesthey have run out of cash. In Scotland, itrsquos called the Scottish Welfare Fund, and itrsquos just been doubled by the Scottish Government. Itrsquos perfectly possible to issue people with a card to use in shops which the Government then loads with money. In Scotland itrsquos called Best Start Foods. Itrsquos perfectly possible in the short term for GPs, schools and welfare agencies to hand out supermarket voucherspeople need them.We have an amazing food distribution system. Cunningly, shops have been located near where people live, and most of them deliver. They are open much of the time. Letrsquos provide ordinary, dignied access to the food distribution system that everyone uses when they can afford it.Making food banks inessential takes a little money, sure. To cover the cost of the food given out each year by Scotlandrsquos foodbanks would be around pound-m ndash % of the poundm investment in tackling poverty announced last week by the Scottish Government.To raise the incomes of the poorest % of the population of the UK by pound per week and make a real dent on food insecurity would cost poundbn ndash % of the rescue package announced last week by the UK government.And it needs a little work to imagine a Scotland without foodbanksndash but rather less than imagining a national lockdown, a ban on weddings, rail renationalisation, no football, no church.Wersquove discovered that we genuinely are all in this together this time.

Mali in West Africa, for example, has three ventilators per million people. In Zambia, there is one doctor for approximately , people. In Pakistan health spending per head is one two-hundredth the level in the United States, one of the richest countries in the world which itself is struggling to cope with the effects of the virus.:Coronavirus: the decade-old warnings left unheeded by Scottish ministersConsider, too, that currently itrsquos estimated that more than . billion people worldwide live in substandard housing. Of those, at least  million have no home at all.Then there are the  million displaced people worldwide. Among them are the Rohingya in camps on Bangladeshrsquos border with Myanmar and hundreds of thousands of Syrians escaping Idlib province crammed up against the border barrier with Turkey.For many of these people, social distancing is a near impossibility as is regular hand-washing in places often already unsanitary and without clean running water.As statistics go,these are not enough to send a chill down the spine then I donrsquot know what is. I do know that to talk of the world right now feels tough in these times. We are all intimately feeling the pain in one shape or form from the impact of coronavirus.But to ignore what is unfolding where, in far-flung parts of the world, is to do so at our peril.As former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who beat Ebola in Liberia, put it recently: ldquoCoronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.While a truism in itself,one other thing is certain in these uncertain times, itrsquos how history has shown us that pandemics hit the poorest hardest.The Spanish flu of   is said to have wiped out % of Indiarsquos population, the vast majority among the countryrsquos poorest and most vulnerable. More recently, most people who died of Aids were African, those from a continent where swathes of the population exist on or below the subsistence level and where healthcare provision is often sparse to say the least.Just last month, Bill Gates, the American business magnate and philanthropist, warned that the pandemic could kill  million Africansit were allowed to rip through the continent. Just now it is wealthy countries that are the epicentre of this deadly virus, but as Jose MariaVera, interim executive director of Oxfam International, ominously observed the other day, already Covid- has started to ldquoprey through the colossal cracks that ide our world.So just what are the implications for the worldrsquos poorest and most vulnerable as the pandemic takes grip within their countries and communities  What must be done to assist in militating against its worst ravages :Scotlands chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood spotted flouting coronavirus lockdown rules in visit to second homeAs Abiy Ahmed, the  Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prime minister of Ethiopia, rightly pointed out in the Financial Times last week,Covid- is not controlled in Africa and other parts of the developing world then it ldquowould quickly bounce back on the rest of the world.Many of the worldrsquos neighbourhoods the pandemic now threatens are the last stop.These are places where a person canrsquot fall any further short of being totally destitute or dead. In many years of covering the world as a reporter, Irsquove seen first hand the struggle to survive in these places of near unimaginable squalor and poverty.Places like the slums of Kibera, Mathare and Korogocho in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, which are among some of the biggest in Africa.In fact, itrsquos estimated that % of Nairobirsquos entire population ndash some . million people ndash are slum dwellers, many living up to  to a single room in little more than a corrugated steel shack.In the Korogocho slum in the city, countless people survive by scavenging the gigantic and infamous Dandora illegal dumpsite. There, thousands of tonnes of waste are heaped daily from across the city, including the unfinished food from the flights arriving at Nairobirsquos international airport, where almost all the coronavirus cases gained entry into Kenya.But those slum dwellers in Africa are far from alone in the teeming cheek-by-jowl existence and wretchedness that blights their lives.Far from Africa on the Caribbean island of Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere and barely a few hours flying time from Miami and New York, people in slums like Cite Soleil likewise live one on top of another in an indescribably filthy warren of alleyways and concrete boxes.During one visit, just after the devastating  earthquake that has since made the situation worse, I was told how , people crammed into a single kilometre in parts of Cite Soleil. So congested was it that ldquosht sleepingrsquorsquo was common, and families would bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside. In such communities the arrival of coronavirus is a near death sentence.For both slum dwellers and often refugees alike, population density is perhaps the first in a series of factors that makes them extremely vulnerable to the spread of the virus. In the case of refugees, multiple families are often forced to share the same bathroom, and the same cooking and bathing facilities,they have access at all.Second, both groups generally have dficulty accessing basic services, especially healthcare. Third, the limited access to reliable information for displaced communities will also complicate efforts to respond. Misinformation, mistrust of authorities, the absence of communication networks, and language barriers can all prevent accurate and far-reaching messaging among those living in urban slums and refugees in informal camps.ldquoWithout critical information about coronavirus, the displaced may not only risk spreading the infection, but find themselves in violation of new policies, warned the humanitarian agency Refugees International in a newly published report addressing the threat posed by Covid- to already existing emergencies involving displaced people across the globe.ldquoAt risk of deportation, asylum seekers without legal status are often reticent to trust local authorities, much less reveal themselves once they get sick, the report highlighted.For aid agencies the challenges are immense as their humanitarian supply chain may be broken by the outbreak and aid workers perhaps have to reduce or cut contact with communities to help prevent spread of the virus. Many humanitarian agencies also warn that they will not have the training or resources to respond to such an unprecedented crisis.All this, too, before the role of politics in impacting on the most vulnerable, as national governments often restrict the movement of international personnel and supplies or close borders. Aid agencies fear a looming disaster both for slum dwellers and those refugees and migrants in informal camps.ldquoWhen the virus hits overcrowded settlements in places like Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Greece, the consequences will be devastating, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, warned last week. ldquoThere will also be carnage when the virus reaches parts of Syria, Yemen and Venezuela, where hospitals have been demolished and health systems have collapsed.Such challenges for aid agencies and the poorest are only made worse, of course, in those countries where the political leadership is scathing of the threat prosed by the pandemic.In Brazil, for example, president Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the coronavirus as nothing more than the ldquosnfles and criticised regional lockdown measures.Such is the anger with Bolsonarorsquos response that recently many of those living in Brazilrsquos low-income favelas or unregulated slums in major cities took part in a \"aco\", a protest that involves banging pots together outside a window and screaming insults such as ldquoBolsonaro, out! and ldquoBolsonaro Assassin!.:Highland police forced to add extra patrols amid plans for public COVID- marchStepping into the breach, meanwhile, in the absence of a considered and concerted response by Bolsonarorsquos government, Brazilrsquos drug gangs and paramilitary groups began enforcing social distancing to combat the spread of coronavirus. Just these past weeks, as the Covid- death toll has climbed, gang members have been circulating in the Cidade de Deus ndash City of God ndash favela in western Rio ordering residents to remain indoors after pm.The community, made famous by Fernando Meirelles  movie blockbuster City Of God, was among the first to record a case of coronavirus.ldquoWhoever is caught on the street will learn how to respect the measure. We want the best for the population. If the government is unable to manage, organised crime resolves, read one message circulated by WhatsApp to residents of one Rio slum.But exceptionally bizarre responses such as this aside, it remains national government and help from the international community that most of the worldrsquos poorest communities will depend on in their bitter struggle with the pandemic.Time now is of the essence. Africa has reached a ldquobreak the glass moment, an emergency in which international actors need to take drastic actionthe worldrsquos poorest continent is to avoid a human and economic catastrophe, Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghanarsquos finance minister, told the Financial Times last week.The problem is that so many places are now facing their own ldquobreak the glass emergency moment with potentially nightmarish economic consequences.More than % of the worldrsquos poorest countries ndash and half of those active in international bond markets ndash were already in or at high risk of debt distress before the crisis hit.Some  countries have already approached the International Monetary Fundfor short-term emergency assistance in recent weeks, around double the number that called on the fund in the immediate aftermath of the  financial crisis.As many humanitarian agencies also point out, many responses will have very specic needs that require a strategy tailored to the circumstances of the population in question. As the recent Refugees International report has made clear, however, there are common elements across countries and continents that should be part of any effective humanitarian response to the pandemic.Among those identied include ensuring that the response must be inclusive, reaching all vulnerable populations, including slum dwellers, refugees, asylum seekers, and the internally displaced.It will need to enhance communication and flow of information, deploy medical personnel and protective clothing, improve access to water and hygiene, and focus on isolation and quarantine capacities as well as testing for the virus.If there are positives in all of this one of them is that the population of poor countries are predominately young with a median age of , in theory making many physically more resilient. But offset this against hunger, and already existing ill health, and it is of little comfort.On a more constructive note, especially in Africa, many lessons have been learned from fighting Ebola, but coronavirus is an altogether dferent proposition in terms of infection rate and spread. The bottom line is that any response will be incredibly challenging and problematic for the international community and those organisations tasked with helping those most in need, not least as governments globally look to their domestic needs and demands during the crisis.But it is precisely the scale and speed of the pandemic that has underscored how deeply interconnected the worldrsquos populations are.Across the globe, the poorest and most vulnerable have sometimes been regarded as a sea of lost souls, their lives ignored, hidden from sight or forgotten. The coronavirus pandemic has reminded us all of the dangers in such blindness, as well as the moral imperative that exists to assist those most in need in overcoming the onslaught they now face.Former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is right. Coronavirus anywhere is a threat to people everywhere.________________________________________________________Shops across Scotland are closing. Newspaper sales are falling.

His move comes after the repeated failure of the Health Department to commit to provide PPE in sufficient quantity to frontline healthcare workers.Over recent weeks, workers in hospitals and care homes as well as other frontline workers in pharmacies and GP practices have been crying out for additional PPE supplies to protect them from contracting the coronavirus. However, despite repeated calls — the most recent being yesterdayby Royal College of Nursing director Pat Cullen in a meeting with the First and deputy First Minister — frontline workers speaking to the Andersonstown News say there is still a widespread shortage of equipment.A full-face visor is a vital —but scarce —defence for NHS workers in face of coronavirusAmong the most valued but hardest-to-get items is the full-face shield now being manufactured by Shnuggle of Newtownards, a company which previously focused on baby products. The firm has orders for , shields and was able to ramp up production after the donation from the Argento boss. Shnuggle is sending packs of  Hero Shields to key workers across the North. The shields are being produced following open source blueprints which means they can be replicated by any other company across the globe without paying a royalty to Shnuggle.On hearing of the new source for the highly-prized face shields, several care homes across Belfast made immediate bids for supplies. One care home alone said it could take  shields immediately.Pete Boyle has taken steps to share the open source manufacturing detail with groups in America where there is a similarly deadly shortage. #We should stop trying to source this equipment from China and start manufacturing it now. Make it, don#t source it. Anyone with a -D printer or an injection mould facility can be up and running immediately# he said. vw, px\"  #Make it, don#t source it.# Pete Boyle#I felt kind of helpless,# added Pete Boyle. #And yet, when I contacted the health service to offer assistance, I was getting mixed messages.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk.

The Minister also emphasised that every conceivable effort is being made to improve both situations. “I can assure staff and the wider public that these two issues are receiving absolute priority. It’s no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites. “Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly. googletag.cmd.push “This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs. “I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that. “However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Swann stressed:“I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead. But I want to be totally frank about the pressures that exist. If there were quick fixes available, I would certainly have used them.” Turning to PPE, the Minister said:“Our health service has signicant levels of PPE in stock at present but need to boost these quantities given the expected level of demand in coming weeks. Our PPE supplies have been supported through release of % of the emergency pandemic stockpile as announced last week – in the region of  million items. “Updated UK-wide NHS guidance on PPE use has been issued. This guidance will inform PPE use across our system and help us to prioritise distribution. “I fully understand that staff on the frontline need reassurance. I believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will both play a part in allaying concerns. “I want to make absolutely clear that the PPE guidance is about ensuring staff have the appropriate level of protection for the circumstances they are working in – it is absolutely not, nor will it ever be, about seeking to restrict the use of equipment.” He continued:“The situation with PPE supply has been made more challenging by the fact that supply routes from China, a leading global provider, were closed until recently. “I am actively working with the Finance Minister to pursue all feasible supply routes, both international and local. “I recognise that other NI Departments are also facing PPE challenges. We have to tackle this together across the Executive and also to appreciate the scale of global competition for PPE products. The Minister added:“It would be facile for anyone to suggest that there has been any lack of urgency. We are doing everything we can to best of our ability to make things better. “Our health service has been under consider financial pressure for the past  years. That has inevitably had a bearing on its capacity. I cannot undo that, but I will work night and day for the sake of the public and our great health and social care staff. Colleagues right across the system at all levels are doing the same.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There certainly should be a coordinated approach North and South but there are actions Stormont Executive parties and the Dail have not been willing to act on when it comes to PPE, Covid- test kits and ventilators. They havent been willing to put public health ahead of private companies raking in massive profits in the midst of this crisis. This is why their response has been slow, inadequate and putting lives at risk. googletag.cmd.push When the WHO declared Covid- a global pandemic on January  manufacturers should have been directed by Westminster, Stormont and the Dail to repurpose production to mass produce PPE. This didnt happen and now were scrambling to get them from China. It can still happen. For testing of Covid- and mass testing, Randox Laboratories in Crumlin, Antrim, should be put under public control. Randox has received tens of millions in public money but have be allowed to go on a profiteering binge. Instead of being directed to mass produce testing kits as part of an integrated all-Ireland health strategy theyve been able to charge exorbitant prices. Prince Charles, Boris Johnson and elites get tested while workers and the sick dont. Put Randox under public control now. googletag.cmd.push Randox pays Tory MP Owen Patterson pound, a year and have been allowed to put profits for shareholders ahead of people and profit. The rich and powerful shouldnt have access to testing when frontline workers cant. Thirdly, Medtronic based in Galway, is a global manufacturer of le-saving ventilators. Medtronic should also be put under public control to produce thousands of ventilators for health services North and South. Business cant go on as usual in response to this crisis. Private companies cant be allowed to put profiteering ahead of people and health. These are actions that should be taken but the political establishment, so long subservient to powerful corporations, wont contemplate them unless they come under pressure to do so.

It read: “During the disturbances of  it enjoyed comparative tranquillity.” Anyone living in the County Derry town at the time of the ill-fated United Irishmen rebellion would no doubt disagree. The ins and outs of the  rebellion were played out at a local level across the country, something local historian Joseph McCoy thinks is not mentioned enough in schools. He says: “I understand the necessity to look at the First and Second World Wars, but they have so little about the place we’re living in, particularly the local stuff. googletag.cmd.push “The story of  in Maghera is complex. There’s a whole plethora of dferent writers on the subject but no two stories are the same. That tells me that they are pulling a lot from folklore.” Troops had been stationed in the town before the rising began in June  and the rebellious plans were being drawn up around them. An account of how recoat army captain Francis Lamont met and married the daughter of hotel proprietor Jack O’Neill bears testament to this. Captain Lamont, second in command to Colonel Leith, had been passing what is now known as Walsh’s, when he found himself transfixed by a young girl working in the hotel. googletag.cmd.push When she ed his glance, the captain turned to his superior and told him in no uncertain terms thatshe were not yet married, she would be his we. The pair were married in May  and Lamont was named on a list of people who donated to the building of Glen chapel, where the couple rest in the graveyard. It was certainly not the last time love flourished with a meeting of eyes in Walsh’s Hotel.  History and folklore have weaved a rich tapestry of tragedy, violence, compassion and love at the foot of the Glenshane in . The town was so involved in the skirmishes that after the uprising failed, Colonel Leith’s redcoat army may have planned to reduce it to rubble in retribution. In an article for the Maghera Times, a local historical paper, Joseph McCoy wrote: “Initial suggestions tell us that the army was prepared to blow the town to pieces with a detachment of cannon, which had been placed on top of a hill overlooking the town.” However, Maghera was spared, and the people lived to pass on the tales of the rebellion’s leaders in the town, many of whom suffered reprisals in its aftermath. Rev. John Glendy  Rev. Glendy provided leadership to the volunteers in the years leading up to , which led to James Spottswood of the Salters Company in Magherafelt admonishing him in print in . He wrote: “Glendy of Maghera is tainted with the blackest principles of revolution. His many sermons are but discourses containing treason. “We have seen him on erse occasion with the Popish priest of Magherafelt in that union of the Romish Church with whom he does conspire against this Realm.” Glendy composed the oath sworn by all members of the United Irishmen, and at some meetings, stood behind a pulpit bearing the legend ‘vive la Republique’, in a nod to the French revolution. As expected, the hunt for Glendy in the aftermath of the rebellion was an earnest one. He fled to a place called the Grove where he stayed with a man named Wilson for a fortnight. One popular account of how Glendy evaded capture was by borrowing a petticoat, cloak, bonnet and stockings from a woman named Sarah MacQuirken and escaping dressed as a woman. His escape was almost foiled when a local magistrate called Forrester recognised him, but his Presbyterian colleague, Clark, restrained him from making an arrest. The unusual attire also helped him evade a passing redcoat patrol in Tobermore, but his fate was sealed when troops surrounded a friend’s house and he was forced to hand himself in. Glendy was imprisoned on a barge moored in Belfast Lough before being exiled in America, where he became chaplain to the US House of Representatives in  and the Senate in . He passed away in Philadelphia in October  and is buried in Baltimore. Walter ‘Watty’ Graham  Synonymous with the GAA tradition in Glen, the name Watty Graham is familiar in Maghera and its surrounds. Graham was an Elder in the local Presbyterian church and had been central to organising the rebellion’s activity in Maghera. After it was quelled, his house was set on fire in reprisal and after a bounty of pound was placed on his head, he set off for Magilligan, from where he intended to travel to Moville. En route, he stopped at the Rectory of Tamlaght, where he intended to collect pound that the occupier, Mr Church owed him. Mr Church said he would have to go to Maghera to get the money but, in truth, intended to turn him into the authorities in a bid to clear his debt and collect a handsome reward. A servant girl overheard Church telling his we of the plan, and he swore her to secrecy, but the girl found a way to warn Watty Graham of the betrayal. In his book ‘Famous Maghera Men, Eoin Walsh writes how the girl warned Graham using the phrase ‘A herring was never taken on bait’. Graham attempted to evade capture by grabbing a shovel from a nearby workman and telling him to run instead. The soldiers followed the workman, but the Rector spotted the ruse and alerted the soldiers to Graham’s presence. He was swtly arrested. Watty Graham was executed, decapitated and his head carried through the town of Maghera in an intimidatory warning to local supporters of the United Irishmen. His relatives are thought to have retrieved his remains and buried them. Mr Chuch did not live long to enjoy the fruits of his betrayal and was bludgeoned to death at the entrance to his avenue while attending a call to tend to a dying parishioner. William ‘Billy’ Cuddy  In the swirling air of mistrust that prevailed after the rebellion, suspicion was easily aroused, and it cost the le of an innocent man in Billy Cuddy. “An unseasonable jest cost him his le,” wrote Joseph McCoy in his Maghera Times article. Cuddy, a wheelwright and blue dyer by trade, had been employed to insert a pane of glass into a leaden window-frame and remarked that it would not be dficult to turn the lead into bullets. The owner of the house reported him to local clerical magistrate called Clotsworthy Soden, who had him arrested and sentenced to death. “Billy Cuddy had a fairly good relationship with the townsfolk, even the soldiers,” says Joseph. “Colonel Leith, commander of the royalist forces in Maghera, understood that Clotsworthy Soden was maybe overstretching his authority, but it was authority he had. “As they were taking him to his death, he recited the nd psalm at the top of his voice referring to the Rector being to blame for his downfall.” Colonel Leith asked Cuddy on the gallowshe wanted to leave the case in his hands. Many watching on considered it to be an act of mercy, but Cuddy tragically misunderstood the offer. He declared he would ‘leave it to a Higher Power’. Leith deemed that this was a rejection of his offer and William Cuddy was hanged. No further indignity was inflicted on his body though, and local tradition has it that he was cut down from the rope while still alive, nursed back to health and spirited away to America. A mock funeral is said to have been held in Maghera, and a weathered stone in the old St Lurach’s church bears the inscription ‘The Burying Place of William Cuddy’. The names of Glendy, Graham and Cuddy will not catch the eye of many modern-day history students, but they are ingrained in the town of Maghera and its rich history from this period. Their heroic and tragic stories will continue to be passed from generation to generation and the tangible history of Maghera’s United Irishmen will endure.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper. His other two daughters are Cara and Aine.The love of traditional Irish music runs deep in Terryrsquos family with eight of his  grandchildren all musicians.ldquoI have been in self-isolation since my daughter Cara, whorsquos a nurse, advised me to stay in as I have type  diabetes, explained Terry.He continued with his Saturday night singalong for Motherrsquos Day recently when he played such favourites as A Mothers Loversquos A Blessing, Home and The Town I love So Well.Terry says that he will continue to perform every Saturday until the COVID- shutdown is lted. He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin. Most of the time they get on well but there has been a few times that Irsquove caught them wrestling each other in the garden.Lisa has also been coping well with being in lockdown with the children. She said: ldquoJust before the lockdown was implemented I did some forward planning and I stocked my freezer up with meat and essentials.

Dr McBride is not only CMO, he has directly relevant experience of infections, having become a consultant specialist in one of the worst pandemics, HIV, almost  years ago. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Yet I assume that the Republic has similar numbers pro rata of brilliant medical and scientic people to the UK, but the latter has almost  times more people and  times more experts.Republicans haveaccused unionists of slavishly following British advice, when almost the opposite has happened: all the key figures in Northern Ireland’s response to the crisis support close co-operation with the Republic, as makes sense on an island, while republicans have obsessively promoted all-island responses, and trashed the overall UK approach.The party wants a severe lockdown, closing manufacturers such as Ulster Carpets who say they are practising safe social distancing for employees, yet it delayed on granting powers to the PSNI . NI was the last place in the UK to clary what police could do.Ms O’Neill is implying that the WHO and UK have an utterly erging approach, when in fact they have largely the same approach with some dferences.It is not unreasonable for the deputy first minister, without expertise, to think that one group of scientists is right and another wrong. Lord Sumption, the ex Supreme Court judgewho said the UK Covid- response was hysterical , pointed out that we are not ruled by scientists. We apply our own critical faculties to advice he said.But what a coincidence that in applying such critical thinking, Sinn Fein cannot find a UK gesture that it likes, such as soldiers rapidly helping increase hospital beds for the patients for whom republicans profess such concern or the Treasury using its firepower to offer big support to business and citizens.If Ms O’Neill and her party are so damning of the UK, it is strange that they never issued a critique of the records ofearly deliberations of Britain’sScientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . The war historian Sir Lawrence Freedman analysed them for the long respected, left leaning New Statesman journal. It showed how experts were agreed on some responses, but uncertain or ided on others. The UK is now behind on tests but few nations have found it easy: the Republic set up community tests before retreatingwhen it was swamped. Testing has been a problem for all but the most prepared places like South Korea .The UK is badly behind on Personal Protection Equipment and ventilators, as are most nations.But the WHO is not beyond criticism. Its response to the situation in China in January was at first confused and perhaps complacent and I suspect it is too trusting of the recent Chinese data of miniscule infection rates and death numbers. WHO also seemed unable to answer easily this newspaper’s elementary query on whether global data distinguished between deaths of people who had the virusand deaths caused by it . Such a distinction is crucial to understanding the lethality of coronavirus.The validity of some early UK concerns are becoming apparent, such as damage to mental health of starting lockdown too early .It is not surprising, or even wrong, that republicans saw first Brexit then Covid- as opportunity for a cherished, centuries old goal of a single independent Ireland.What is wrong is that they have bought into an abnormal system of mandatory coalition , which can only work on the basis of collective responsibility . After Brexit, Sinn Fein cited RHI to collapse devolution but then made other demands for its . Now they openly undermine cabinet colleagues, as Ms O’Neill did to the Health Minister Robin Swann on Thursday’s BBC The View.When other parties challenge this and a row ensues some people blame ‘both sides’. But most people are not fooled as to what is going on.No Irish government will ever call the party out. The question is whether the UK sovereign government one day might, and then move to make such abuse impossible.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorWHO accepts dficulties teasing out true Covid- death rates"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown and eerie sound silence ","story":"Coronavirus: NI death toll climbs by eight in last  hoursCoronavirus: Two maps that show Covid-’s streak across Northern Ireland in  days – check your area for casesNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionColumnistsLockdown and the eerie sound of silence...It’s the silence that gets to me.

On Monday I welcomed the sound of the refuse collection team all that banging of bins, revving of engines and happy banter as the collectors got to work, a combined noise that can be irritatingyou are out trying to go somewhere in a hurry. Bless them, theirs is a tough chore, but I’m happy to let them know I’ll be listening out for them next week because there’s not much  making a noise now that we are in lock-down.Of course, there are noisy birds and I have plenty of them around - seagulls, crows, pigeons and doves, not to mention the usual flocks of blackbirds, thrushes and a iety of small ones from robins to sparrows. Just occasionally the dog charges manically out of the door to scatter them, so I welcome his noise too. A couple of days ago a man on an ancient, noisy motorbike went past. No doubt it’s the love of his le and he was probably off work due to the viral crisis so took the opportunity to give it a spin down the road. Himself does the same occasionally when he decides to give his motorbike an airing.

He might be the heir to the throne but he’s as vulnerable as the rest of us and the shock of his misfortune saw the BBC go into overdrive. Funny how the prince got it and not Camilla, whose health has been a source of concern. The couple are now at Balmoral where, hopefully, he will find peace and quiet to get over the shock. We do worry for the Queen, who, at  years, has had to escape to Windsor. Off she went in her state car, her favourite dog on her knee, no doubt knowing she ran the same risks as the rest of us.But, back to the silence. Two weeks ago I was cursing the roaring wind when I could scarcely hear myself speak, but as I write it is dead quiet outside. Not a bush moves and there is no ruffle of leaves since its early spring and they are still forming on the branches. No-one in the vicinity is mowing a lawn or trimming a hedge with one of those cutters the noise of which I absolutely hate. Yet, I would have welcomed any noise this week. I suppose we are all a bit shell-shocked at the rapid change in our lives. When the Prime Minister came on television the day after Mothering Sunday, when the entire population, it seemed, was out enjoying the event, I could see the anger in his eyes and knew the news was bad. I knew he meant business. No more gadding about was to be permitted.On Mothers’ Day we had gone out because it was such a nice day. We decided to go to Slemish, a beautul part of thecounty, a place which gets most of its visitors on St Patrick’s Day. The beautul, mysterious former volcanic core, which Slemish is, had an air of bemusement about it at the sight of oodles of people climbing up its tracks, leaving dozens of cars at its foot. The noise of revving engines was deafening. Sights like these, I suspect, left Boris ballistic. Frankly I didn’t expect to see it, given the circumstances – we had already been warned about gadding about - so maybe now Slemish can enjoy peace and quiet until this crisis is over.So, how will we all fill our days when we can’t get out much except to buy food, greet visitors to our homes, or enjoy a coffee out with friends  In truth, I don’t know at this early stage but one thing I’m grateful for is the humour of the internet era. Daily, friends send me hilarious video clips, which I send on to others.

This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear. In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is...”Already we see evidence of this at Stormont where January’s rhetoric of a new beginning, an end to departments working against each other and a new era of collective responsibility has evaporated – most dramatically in Michelle O’Neill’s brutal defenestration of Health Minister Robin Swann on prime time television on Thursday night.Both the DUP and the UUP have been scathing about Sinn Féin, accusing the party of acting “disgracefully” in undermining Mr Swann’s efforts over recent weeks. Current and former very senior civil servants have this week spoken with private dismay, with one experienced and generally restrained former mandarin yesterday saying that Ms O’Neill’s attack on Mr Swann had been “shameful” and did nothing to help battle the virus.However, Ms O’Neill’s frequent criticisms of Mr Swann’s actions, and accusation that he is “slavishly” following a flawed Westminster strategy which will cost lives, has signicant public support.Questions about the UK’s response to the pandemic have been growing in London over recent weeks and already a large section of the population had no confidence in Boris Johnson, even though he appears to be overwhelmingly following scientic and medical advice.With the caveat that few of us know much about the complexities of responding to a pandemic, Stormont’s response to this crisis has appeared sluggish, compartmentalised and unquestionably confused – although some of the confusion stems from the contradictory positions adopted by DUP and Sinn Féin’ ministers.Rather than share the blame for the actions of the Executive, Sinn Féin has adopted a position of GovOpposition – opposing the government not just from within, but from the top of the administration. That will have implications for other ministers’ willingness to share pain for decisions taken by Sinn Féin ministers, and could even lead to the UUP walking away entirelyit believes it is unable to work in these circumstances.But Sinn Féin, Stormont’s most strategically astute party, will be aware that what happens over coming weeks may be of enormous signicance in the border poll which it hopes will be called within a few years.Although the NHS is a relatively modern institution, for decades it has been one of the jewels in the crown of the pragmatic argument for the Union. Even for some instinctive nationalists, the idea of paying  Euro to see a doctor is unsettling.For years, the NHS has been creaking across the UK – but especially in Northern Ireland. Senior doctors say that any health system would be overwhelmed by a pandemic of this scale and it is far too early to meaningfully compare death rates on either side of the border.Butthis pandemic exposes that far from the NHS in Northern Ireland being better than the Republic’s healthcare system, that it could actually be worse, that would have enormous political implications.Coupled with that could be the creation of an Irish NHS. Last week the Republic nationalised private hospitals, creating its first ever national single-tier health service. That is only intended for the duration of the crisis, but there is a long history of temporary measures at times of national upheaval becoming permanent.All of that is hypothetical – but will be in the minds of some senior Stormont figures.In an interview with an American reporter in the wake of the  vote for Brexit, Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin’s strategic mastermind for decades, spoke with unusual candour.He told Vice News: “Never waste a crisis, never waste a dficulty...why should we pick up the bad collateral damage for a stupid decision taken in London ”There is an ineluctable shared logic to that view of Northern Ireland being forced into a bad decision by London and Sinn Féin’s narrative about this crisis.A pandemic is not an orange or green issue, but that does not mean that all politicians who define themselves by orange or green abandon those viewpoints for the duration of the emergency.There is nothing inherently wrong with a politician viewing the world through the lens of their ideology indeed it is dficult for anyone to fully set aside the ideas and aspirations which form their worldview.Arlene Foster and UUP leader Steve Aiken have in recent days highlighted how Northern Ireland has benefited from being part of the UK – the chancellor’s vast economic stimulus, the NHS and the ability to procure ventilators – while Sinn Féin has argued that because Dublin’s strategy has been more consistently in line with the World Health Organisation’s advice that it is superior.But most of the public would view it as inexcusable for ideological disputes to hamper efforts to save lives.Most of the population is for now transfixed with fear or pursuing escapism, hoping that they and their loved ones survive the coming storm. But others are joining up the dots. Two and a half weeks ago, freelance journalist Amanda Ferguson tweeted: “First the Brexit shenanigans and now the comparisons between the British and Irish government coronavirus responses. New Irelanders may not even need to border poll canvas at this rate.”Among those who retweeted the comment was senior Sinn Féin MLA Martina Anderson.Most of us are not ideologues. Whatever our political preferences, they do not dominate our waking thoughts. But politics is a battle of ideas and it is generally those who are most committed and most ruthless who win.This emergency has revealed broken elements of the existing world order in most countries. In most nations that may mean a change of government, or maybe economic changes. But in Northern Ireland there is an obvious and far more radical alternative – Irish unity.However, there are also vast perils for politicians. If they are seen to be exploiting a humanitarian catastrophe for political gain, many of the public will be appalled.But eventhat is not the case, the emotions involved in this time of terror are such that in a community as ided as ours the response could become beyond control.On the day in January that the Executive was restored, Michelle O’Neill said: “From today, the parties represented in the Chamber undertake to cooperate in every way that we can in order to rebuild public trust and confidence in, and engagement with, the Assembly and its Executive.”That has gone. But we cannot yet know what will take its place.---A message from the Editor:\u2028Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Nobody knows those guidelines better than Catherine and the rest of us.ldquoSo Irsquom confident that she was safe during that, her family were safe and those around them were safe.A Scottish Government spokesman said on Saturday: ldquoSince this start of this epidemic, the CMO has been working seven days a week preparing Scotlandrsquos response.ldquoShe took the opportunity this weekend to check on a family home in Fe as she knows she will not be back again until the crisis is over.ldquoShe stayed overnight before ing to Edinburgh.ldquoIn line with guidance, she stayed within her own household group and observed social distancing with anyone she was in passing in the village..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Scotland us chief medical officer pictured visiting second home article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

We serve all the surgeries around the South East of England. All the pathology departments of these hospitals work together. We go out and collect specimens, drop off mail, absolutely anything that needs transporting. We all have our set routes, so every day was just a normal driving-a-van day. It was the same thing every day. vw, px\"Dave Holt says the pace of le has accelerated since Covid- hit the UK ndash How has that changed now The pace of le has accelerated pretty dramatically. Itrsquos a proper team effort, all hands to the deck. Wersquore doing lots of resupplying, wersquore driving around picking up samples, getting stuff moved around, making sure that the hospitals have got their supplies. Some of the staff have had to self-isolate. Wersquove gone from doing one route to doing two or three driversrsquo routes on our own. Irsquom only a van driver, I do as Irsquom told, but you can clearly see everybodyrsquos pulling together, everybodyrsquos doing beyond everything.ndash Whatrsquos it like being involved in the fight against coronavirus The way I look at it is quite simple: you guys have paid your tax and National Insurance ndash itrsquos my job to do what Irsquom told. Thatrsquos how I go out every single day. Yes it preys on my mind, yes there are times when I might have my own feelings but they have to stay at the back of my mind: Irsquoll go home and cry my eyes out to my missus, or let my emotions run wild with her, but when Irsquom at work all that has got to stay at the back of my mind. Irsquove just got to focus on the job in hand.ndash How do you cope with the increased stress When I come home Irsquom so tired and mentally exhausted of what Irsquove seen that literally I just pass out, I just go to sleep. Bang. I turn the news off, I watch movies, I watch Star Trek, I play my computer games, just to shut myself away from it and recharge myself and think when I get up the following morning lsquoright, bang, here we go again, off we gorsquo. Thatrsquos how I deal with it. vw,vw,px, px\"Dave makes deliveries at hospitals around Surrey and Berkshire ndash Who do you think the heroes of this pandemic are Itrsquos amazing to me that people in society that have been classied as shall we say at the bottom of the rung are the ones right now that are keeping the country going. The people in the shops, the bus drivers, the refuse collectors. Theyrsquore the heroes. The police officers, the ambulance drivers ndash all the people that are out there now keeping us all going. Even the people that are listening and staying in, sitting at home bored. I see heroism in a dferent form in dferent people every day.ndash What do you make of the publicrsquos support for the NHS The people that are out there clapping at night ndash it does make a dference. It makes you feel that yoursquore wanted and needed. I went into a garage to fill up with fuel and the guy behind the counter said, lsquoCan I get you a coffee mate  Itrsquos on the housersquo. There were three or four other people, keeping their distance, and one of the guys shouted across to me and said, lsquoWe all appreciate what yoursquore doing, matersquo. I have experienced some incredible generosity and some proper inspiring moments that, when Irsquove felt a bit low, have given me a bit of a kick up the backside.

Its no secret that MOT centres and the SSE Arena are among the options being pursued by the HSC system as staff testing sites.Staff testing numbers are expanding and will continue to do so as rapidly as possible. I fully understand the frustration that we have not been able to scale up testing numbers more quickly.This is not down to a lack of will or action. There are signicant challenges including laboratory and staffing capacity and the unprecedented levels of global demand for testing reagents and swabs.I want to make clear that we have been in contact with local company Randox over the past number of days regarding its testing product. We have been informed by Randox that its production line is fully geared towards the NHS as a whole and NI will receive a share of that.However, we will also continue to explore procuring testing products separately from NHS wide arrangements. We do not want to be dependent on one source for these products.Mr Swann stressed: I am confident we will make signicant progress on staff testing in the days ahead.
