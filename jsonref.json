Here’s our tracker of the results so you can keep fully up to date: Speaking to the media on Sunday afternoon, the Scottish Conservative leader was in jubilant mood as he proclaimed he had stopped a SNP majority and “stopped indyref2”. As Michael Gove did earlier this morning, Ross dodged the question of whether the UK government would take the Scottish government to court if it progressed legislation for a second referendum – as Sturgeon has said she will, after the immediate Covid crisis has passed. He said that it was more important to focus on the competency of the Holyrood parliament, implying that the matter was unlikely to get to a court battle. He pointed out that both the lord advocate and the presiding officer had a role in deciding what legislation is competent to be passed by the Scottish parliament – according to the Scotland Act, matters relating to the union are reserved to Westminster, hence the need for a section 30 from the UK government.The counsel general, Jeremy Miles, suggested as much in an interview on BBC Radio Wales when he said there were “precedents where we have successfully been able to negotiate budget agreements, legislative arrangements on a case-by-case basis with other parties”. On Saturday the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: In the last Welsh government, the only Lib Dem, Kirsty Williams, served as education minister. Williams did not stand for reelection. The only Lib Dem elected this time, Jane Dodds, has ruled out joining the government. The Welsh Conservatives Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said he hoped someone from his party could be the next Llywydd – or presiding officer.It was an extraordinary result by any standards after 14 years in power. Indeed, due to the proportional nature of the Holyrood voting system, a majority has been achieved only once since the Scottish parliament was established, in 2011 by the SNP under the leadership of former first minister Alex Salmond. Much analysis during the campaign was given over to how pro-independence voters might respond to Salmond’s argument that hundreds of thousands of ballots cast for the SNP’s list candidates in 2016 were “the ultimate wasted vote” as they led to only a handful of MSPs being elected. A vote for Alba, the party he launched only six weeks ago, would help secure a “pro-independence super-majority” at Holyrood, Salmond said, and make it far harder for Boris Johnson to refuse a second referendum. Last week, SNP candidates reported that, while voters were asking more questions about the two-part voting system this campaign, their growing awareness was not benefiting Alba, but the Scottish Greens instead. But as Salmond’s tactical pro-independence plan tanked, with Alba not expected to return any MSPs, there was significant evidence of pro-union voters acting strategically. Read the full article here: The council was previously under no overall control, with the Liberal Democrats and Conservative both holding 24 of the 58 seats. The St Albans Liberal Democrat MP Daisy Cooper tweeted she was “super proud” of the St Albans Lib Dems team. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, asked whether social care reform would form part of this week’s Queen’s speech, told Times Radio: But their disastrous showing was also attributed to what the campaign organisation Hope not Hate described as Boris Johnson’s “hyping of a cultural war” and the attraction of former far-right votes to a populist agenda that included strong anti-immigration messaging. The far-right group, For Britain, got less than 50 votes in 25 of the 47 council wards for which results were available on Friday afternoon. More than 100 votes were secured in only 10 of the wards contested by the party.  The results confirmed how politically irrelevant the British far right has been becoming in recent years, according to Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate. After the BNP’s collapse in 2010, most of its supporters had been swept up by UKIP and then the Brexit party, he said, while many of the same voters had since switched to the Conservative party. In the elections to Scotland’s parliament, the former deputy leader of Britain First, Jayda Franzen, lost her deposit after polling a paltry 46 votes in Glashow Southside. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had confronted her and described her as “a “fascist” and “racist”. The party gained nine seats from Labour and the new council make-up is Tory 28 and Labour 16, with one Green.Known as Woman A, she told the  that the party, under both Keir Starmer and Jeremy Corbyn, had shown no interest in her wellbeing for the past 18 months. She also questioned why Hill, under a parliamentary scheme, was fully insured for legal costs while she had struggled to pay legal bills while sleeping on friends’ sofas. Hill resigned as Labour MP for Hartlepool in March, sparking Thursday’s byelection and a victory for the Conservatives. Hill will face claims of sexual harassment and victimisation, which he denies, at an employment tribunal in central London on Monday. In a statement sent through her barrister, Woman A said she was disappointed in the lack of care shown by Labour. She said no one from the party had contacted her about the case for the past 19 months.

Senior Labour sources were confirming on Saturday evening that Rayner had been asked to relinquish both roles, as the party shakes up its approach to campaigns in the light of a raft of disappointing results in Thursday’s Hartlepool byelection and English council elections. Allies of Rayner were baffled and furious, and a string of MPs lined up to criticise the decision. The row overshadowed the announcement of positive results for Labour, including Burnham’s thumping victory. But by Sunday morning, the Starmer loyalist Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, was claiming Rayner had been offered a “significant promotion”. “Angela Rayner hasn’t been sacked, as I understand it, Angela Rayner has been offered a significant promotion, to take her from the back office of the Labour party running elections, to the front office where she’s talking to the country,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sky News.

Infections and deaths have been hitting new records every two or three days, despite many Indian states having imposed strict lockdowns over the past month, while others have announced restrictions on public movement and shut down cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls.  Public Health Wales said no further deaths were reported, with the total in the country since the start of the pandemic remaining at 5,552.  A total of 1,922,881 first doses of Covid-19 vaccine have now been given in Wales.  The agency said 842,047 second doses have also been administered.The commission last month launched legal action against AstraZeneca for not respecting its contract for the supply of Covid-19 vaccines and for not having a “reliable” plan to ensure timely deliveries. But pressure is mounting on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to announce a nationwide lockdown similar to the one imposed during the first wave last year, Reuters reports. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the umbrella body for all conventional doctors and surgeons, has called for a “complete, well-planned, pre-announced” lockdown across the country instead of “sporadic” night curfews and restrictions imposed by states for a few days at a time.  “IMA is astonished to see the extreme lethargy and inappropriate actions from the ministry of health in combating the agonising crisis born out of the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said in a statement on Saturday.  Modi has already been battling criticism for allowing a huge gathering at a religious festival and holding large election rallies over the past two months even though infections were already surging.  Speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Prof Andrew Pollard said:  When asked for his view on the US waiving virus vaccine patents, he said:  He said there was “huge heavy lifting” to do to allow more manufacturers to produce the vaccine, adding: “It will take the rest of this year before we start seeing large amounts of production.” He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show:  Asked if pupils wearing masks in school would be coming to an end, Gove added:  The government’s coronavirus task force said a further 334 people had died, taking the national death toll to 113,326.  The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and has said Russia recorded around 250,000 deaths related to the virus between April 2020 and March 2021. The Duchess appeared as part of the Global Citizen VAX Live concert, which also featured performances from Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Vedder, Foo Fighters, J Balvin and H.E.R., with a pre-recorded video message in which she said:  The new cases took the total number of infections to 83,375 and total fatalities to 399 since the pandemic started last year. The RKI reported 12,656 new infections on Sunday, as well as a further 127 deaths, taking the total tally of fatalities to to 84,775.  That is a good 3,600 fewer cases than a week ago. The seven-day incidence has dropped to 118.6 from 121.5 the previous day. The value indicates how many people per 100,000 people have been infected in the past seven days.  Eight of the 16 federal states now have an incidence of less than 100. After Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Brandenburg, Berlin and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Rhineland-Palatinate and Bremen also fell below this threshold, below which opening steps are possible in districts and cities with correspondingly lower numbers, and above which contact restrictions must be tightened.  However, regional differences remain large. Schleswig-Holstein, with an incidence of 50, again has the lowest incidence. With an incidence of 180, Thuringia is still the federal state with the highest value, followed by Saxony with 172.8.The state has again not reported any further community transmission, recording zero cases in the 24 hours to 8pm Saturday.  But NSW Health said it was still unable to identify the link between a case in hotel quarantine and two cases in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, which were connected by rapid genomic sequencing work last week. The state will therefore extend the restrictions by another week across greater Sydney, aside from one change, which will allow customers to shop without masks. Retail staff will continue to need to wear masks. On Thursday, the state announced two locally acquired cases, a man in his 50s from Woollahra – dubbed Patient X – and his wife, also in her 50s. The source of their infection has not yet yet been established. But authorities continue to believe he contracted the virus upon brief contact with an infectious person going about their business in the community unwittingly. “Investigations are ongoing into the source of two locally acquired cases, announced on Thursday 6 May,” NSW Health said on Sunday. “They are household contacts of each other a man and woman in their 50s from the eastern suburbs. “Despite extensive investigations to date, NSW Health has not identified how the initial case, the man in his 50s, was exposed to Covid-19, which suggests he acquired the infection through brief contact with a currently unidentified person who was infectious in the community.”India’s Covid-19 deaths rose by more than 4,000 for a second consecutive day on Sunday, amid intensifying calls for a nationwide lockdown.  The country recorded 403,738 new infections in just 24 hours, just shy of the record, and 4,092 further fatalities, taking the overall death toll to 242,362.  On Saturday, India reported its highest ever single-day Covid-19 death toll of 4,187 fatalities. Experts have said the actual numbers for new infections and deaths could be far higher.  Many Indian states have imposed strict lockdowns over the past month to stem the surge in infections while others have announced restrictions on public movement and shut down cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls, Reuters reports.  But pressure is mounting on prime minister Narendra Modi to announce a nationwide lockdown similar to the one imposed during the first wave last year.  The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimates that India will see 1 million deaths from the virus by August.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021.

Photographs: Niall CarsonPA Wire and Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Health Stephen Donnelly has rejected a call by the North’s health minister to stop cross-Border travel due to a spike in Covid-19 cases in Donegal.Northern Ireland health minister Robin Swann wrote to Mr Donnelly last week saying non-essential travel across the Border must be stopped “by enforcement if required”.However, Mr Donnelly said on Sunday the epidemiological situation “wouldn’t warrant that,” and added there were no plans to change the easing of inter-county travel from Monday. “We have an open Border and I don’t want to see that change.”Asked on RTÉ’s This Week programme about high rates of infection in Co Donegal, Mr Donnelly said rates were declining as people in the country were “doing the right thing”.Mr Donnelly said he has yet to reply to Mr Swann but planned to talk to him next week.Over the past week, incidence has fallen from over 300 cases per 100,000 people to 268 and is continuing to reduce, he pointed out.There will shortly be an unwanted excess of vaccines due to limitations on the use of the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines among younger people, according to the minister.The excess would be for a short period of time only but is “something we don’t want,” he said.The Department of Health is expecting a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee next week on whether the use of the two vaccines could be extended to younger age groups. At present, they are restricted to over-50s due to a global issue with very rare blood clots.While declining to say whether he personally was in favour of lowering the age threshold, Mr Donnelly said it was important the vaccines were not “left on the shelf”.In the longer time, Ireland will have an issue with excess vaccines, he pointed out, as the Government has agreements to purchase 18 million doses.Spare doses should be used for booster shots or donated to parts of the world with lower availability of vaccines, he suggested.‘Really positive summer’Mr Donnelly said he would “love” to see spectators attending all-Ireland finals in Croke Park this summer, but added it was not possible to make “definitive statements” at this point.The country is looking at “a really, really positive summer” given the stable state of the disease and accelerating vaccination rates, he predicted.Although there remains some fear that case rates could increase again, cases and average contacts had remained steady over the past weeks as measures were eased.This was because people are “sticking with the basic measures” such as mask-wearing and meeting outdoors and this was having “a bit effect,” he said.The target of vaccinating up to 450,000 people a week would be reached in June, he said. Last week, 230,000 people were immunised, including over 50,000 on Friday, the busiest day yet for the rollout.Mr Donnelly said the accelerated programme would be led by vaccination centres and GPs but he also wanted to see a more prominent role for pharmacists, particularly in administering the one-dose Janssen vaccine.By Friday, 1,799,190 doses had been administered, including 1,305,178 first doses and 494,012 second doses. Just 137 doses of the Janssen vaccine have been administered so far, the HSE’s vaccine tracker shows.Meanwhile, the HSE is operating the following walk-in centres for Covid-19 testing on Sunday: Drumalee, Co Cavan Dunmanway, Co Cork Letterkenny, Co Donegal Blanchardstown and Ballymun, Dublin Galway Airport Tralee, Co Kerry Newbridge, Co.

So that’s a very much accelerated programme of vaccination”.Mr Martin was asked if 450,000 vaccinations per week will be happening in June and if the programme is still on track to meet a target of 80 per cent of adults being inoculated by the end of that month.The Taoiseach said a lot depends on the HSE’s proposals on the rollout.He said: “We’re broadly on target and that’s the operational model that the HSE... and the Department of Health are getting advice on that, and that would certainly make for an optimal outcome in terms of the end of June.”Mr Martin predicted a “a significant psychological uplift” this week as reopening continues from Monday, including a return of hairdressers and barbers and people getting back to work in retail.He said: “I think people are streetwise now... and they know what to do and what not to do.“I think that sort of adherence to the basic guidelines is still vital to ensure that we keep on track and we don’t go backwards.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu member states aim to agree on vaccine certificates for travel by mid june","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has received the Covid-19 vaccine at the HSE operated Vaccine Centre in Cork City Hall. Video: Twitter@@MichealMartinTDThe so-called green digital certificates would show if the bearer has been vaccinated, has tested negative for Covid-19, or has recovered from the illness. File photogrpah: Colin KeeganCollins DublinEuropean Union member states will aim to agree on digital vaccination certificates to ease travel in the bloc by June 21st, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has said.“The timetable now would be that we all hope that by the 21st of June… there is an agreement,” Mr Rutte told journalists following a meeting of EU leaders.Some member states would start using the system immediately, but others would wait as late as August as the 27 governments have agreed there would be a six-week period in which to implement the system, he said.“For the Netherlands, we would do that as quickly as possible after 21st of June,” Mr Rutte said.The so-called green digital certificates would show if the bearer has been vaccinated, has tested negative for Covid-19, or has recovered from the illness. Member states can choose to exempt such people from health restrictions such as quarantine or testing requirements.The system is strongly supported by member states where summer tourism is important for the economy, but some northern countries are more hesitant due to concerns about discrimination and the risk of spreading vaccine-resistant Covid-19 variants through travel.Agreement has not yet been reached on some elements of the system, including how to define people who have recovered from Covid-19. “Between now and 21st of June some big decisions need to be taken,” Mr Rutte said.Work is already advanced on building the digital infrastructure required to link countries up to the system, with the first technical trials of the system due later this month.An Irish Government source said the EU is hopeful of having a green cert in place for the Schengen area on the Continent by late June.Officials here will now assess whether Ireland will opt in to the system and when that would happen.VaccinesMeanwhile, the EU has sealed a deal to buy 900 million BioNTech-Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine doses with the option to add 900 million more, the European Commission has announced.“Other contracts and other vaccine technologies will follow,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen wrote on Twitter as she announced the deal.The doses are for delivery between 2021 and 2023 and are intended for use by member states as booster shots against the illness and to allow for the vaccination of children and teenagers if approved by regulators.In addition, the pharmaceutical companies are developing updated vaccines to combat resistant new variants of Covid-19, and future doses will be tailored to address this.The deal confirms a shift towards using an mRNA vaccine in the EU’s inoculation strategy, as evidence mounts of high efficacy in halting the spread of the virus, and because they have had fewer manufacturing delays than the viral vector AstraZeneca jab.The bloc’s current vaccine deliveries put it on course to vaccinate 70 per cent of its adult population by July – catching up with the United States, where vaccine hesitancy is slowing rollout. Some member states including Ireland may hit the target early.The large order will allow EU member states to donate or re-sell doses if they wish, Ms von der Leyen said.“The contract . . . includes the possibility for the member states to donate or resell doses,” the Commission chief told journalists following the summit. “The amount of doses is so large in order to be able to also serve our neighbourhood, for example.”Leaders meetingThe announcement came as EU leaders including Taoiseach Micheál Martin met in Porto in Portugal to discuss the vaccine rollout and economic recovery from the pandemic.In a joint declaration, the EU leaders declared a commitment to use the continent’s €750 billion Covid-19 stimulus package to foster a “fair, sustainable and resilient recovery” and promote good-quality jobs.“As Europe gradually recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, the priority will be to move from protecting to creating jobs and to improve job quality,” the statement read.“We will prioritise action to support young people, who have been very negatively affected by the Covid-19 crisis, which has profoundly disrupted their participation in the labour market as well as their education and training plans.”The Pfizer purchase announcement comes after it was announced that Ireland is to purchase almost 10 million doses of PfizerBioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine in 2022 and 2023 at a cost of €191 million under plans which were approved by Cabinet on Tuesday.The vaccines are part of an EU additional purchase agreement with the pharmaceutical giant and are to be bought for the possibility that booster jabs are needed in the years ahead.Under the EU agreement Ireland would secure approximately 4.9 million doses in 2022 and the same again in 2023.This would be enough to fully vaccinate approximately 2.45 million people with two doses.Ireland will also retain the option of securing an additional 9.8 million doses over the time period.

Ardern is a female political leader at a time when sections of the press still talk about this like women politicians are unicorns. A year later she added to that advantage by giving birth while in office, which was reported on as though giving birth while holding down a job is unheard of. Coverage has continued in the same vein ever since, helped by the fact that her more important public statements are delivered with lashings of forced empathy. But those of us who are allergic to such bogus forms of communication and who judge people by their actions rather than their capabilities at emoting are noticing that increasingly, Ardern’s behaviour stinks.Last month her oh-so-progressive government made an unprecedented step. It refused to join a Five-Eyes statement which was critical of the Chinese Communist Party. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network (the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) is the world’s most successful and important intelligence-sharing partnership.In being a member of it New Zealand is at an extraordinary advantage – an advantage that far outweighs the miniscule resources it actually puts into intelligence or other defence capabilities.But the refusal was not an oversight by the Ardern government. Rather it was a part of a disgraceful and pro-totalitarian political turn. Ardern’s foreign affairs minister Nanaia Mahuta said that New Zealand now has a preference for moving on from the Five Eyes alliance and looking for new ‘multilateral opportunities’. Except no such better opportunities exist for such a small and isolated power. What is going on is that sweet, lovely Jacinda Ardern and her government are in the process of seeking as much Chinese investment as possible to boost their economy, and doing everything that the CCP wants to ensure that the investment roars in.Well here’s a tip. It can’t be done. You’re either in favour of forced labour camps, neo-colonialism and forced abortions on women who are nine months pregnant, or you’re not. Ardern perhaps hopes that we’ll glide over these awkward facts. And the international press might well. On Wednesday, the New Zealand Prime Minister announced with wonderful timing that she and her partner have set a ‘summer wedding’ date. So yay. Sweet Ardern is back.

Schedule 5 of the 1998 Scotland Act declares the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England to be a reserved matter. After the SNP won an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011, David Cameron agreed to a section 30 order delegating the power to hold a referendum to the Scottish parliament. And Boris Johnson has said that he will not agree to another such order, since the SNP insisted in 2014 that the referendum was a “once in a generation” attempt.Nicola Sturgeon has threatened to defy London by preparing legislation for a Scottish advisory referendum. But such a referendum would be outwith the powers of the Scottish parliament, and any Scottish taxpayer could take the Scottish government to court on the grounds of ultra vires. There is no legal route for Scotland to hold a second referendum if London maintains its refusal.But of course these legalisms do not resolve what is essentially a political issue. Ciaran Martin, a former Cabinet Office adviser involved in preparing the 2014 referendum, has said that if London refuses a second referendum, the Union with Scotland will be shown to rest not on consent but on force. Scotland, he believes, has an inherent right to self-determination, a right that can apparently be exercised whenever there is a pro-independence majority in Holyrood.The argument is that a minority in the United Kingdom is entitled to break away if it represents a compact majority in one part of the kingdom. Could that same right be exercised by a compact majority within Scotland? Even if a second referendum yielded a majority for independence, few can doubt that there would be a large and disaffected minority against it. That minority would be a compact one in the three borders constituencies of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, Dumfries and Galloway, and Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweedale, all of which voted by nearly two-to-one against independence in 2014 and return Conservatives to Westminster. It is hardly likely that these regions would support independence. Should they be extruded from the United Kingdom against their wishes?It will, of course, be said that Scotland is a nation while the borders counties are not. Similarly, in 19th-century Ireland, few doubted that Ireland was a nation until Gladstone proposed Home Rule. But at that point most Protestants declared that they were not part of the Irish nation if that meant rule by a Dublin parliament. They wanted to continue being governed by Westminster. And, as the centenary of Northern Ireland has reminded us, in six counties they were a sufficiently compact majority to make good their claim.For many years Irish nationalists refused to recognise the Unionist case, insisting on the inherent unity of the island of Ireland. Not until the BelfastGood Friday Agreement in 1998 did Ireland accept that unity could not be achieved until Northern Ireland consented to it. The Agreement retrospectively legitimised partition, something inherent in the Irish situation. The only way in which Ireland could have stayed united was, paradoxically, if it had remained part of the United Kingdom.There are of course huge differences between Ireland and Scotland. The Irish national claim was based on a deep feeling that under British rule the Irish were a stigmatised people. The Scots are in no way a stigmatised people. And fortunately there would never be an equivalent in Scotland to the terrorism of the IRA or the Unionist paramilitaries.Nevertheless, the claim that Scotland can break away from England if a majority wish it entails that a majority in the borders counties can break away from Scotland and remain in the United Kingdom if a majority wish it. Nicola Sturgeon’s claim that a second referendum is validated by Brexit which took Scotland out of the EU against its wishes would be paralleled by the claim that Scottish independence was extruding the people of the border counties from the United Kingdom against their wishes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu accused land grab fishermen increase use destructive fly","story":"The EU has been accused of a land grab by fishing groups as it has drastically increased the amount of fly-shooting boats in UK waters.Fly-shooting is a controversial fishing method in which multiple nets are used to encircle and capture entire shoals of fish, and heavy ropes drag across the ocean floor, displacing whatever is underneath.There were originally just a handful of fly-shooters in our waters, but now there are 75 high-powered boats using the method all across UK waters to scoop up bass and mullet.The Chair of New Under Ten Fishermen\u0027s Association  Jeremy Percy told The Fishing Daily: According to French inshore fishermen, it is a waste of time going to sea after these boats have been fishing locally as there is nothing left.Fly shooting has been compared to pulse fishing, which was banned by the UK after we left the EU. This method decimated fish stocks by setting off electric pulses in the ocean.These boats have been licenced by the Marine Management Organisation, which says it will monitor the situation to see if there are impacts on fish stocks.In a letter to Defra, the fishermen said this is not acceptable. They wrote: We have concerns regarding the clear increase in the presence of very large and powerful fly shooters that are being seen increasingly in our western waters.We have received an increasing number of calls over the last couple of years with regard to the fishing effort and impacts of these vessels in the eastern Channel, especially with regard to non quota stocks. It does appear from our perspective that their presence in western waters is something of the marine equivalent of a land grab and this has not been helped by the reported lack of data on the number of vessels using this method of fishing and their catches, either historically or presently.They have asked for the licences to be reviewed, pointing out that the new Fisheries Act gives the UK the power to provide or deny access to our waters based on the social and economic benefits of inidual vessel operations to our own coastal communities.Mr Percy added: The under ten fleet in the UK has been hanging on by its fingertips for years, increasingly reliant on fewer and fewer species, hemmed in by everyone from the EU fleet parked on our 6 mile line to increased calls for inshore MPA’s, licences capped, promises of a fair allocation of quota broken time and again, a draconian licencing regime and yet more restrictions on those few species that we are allowed to catch.Yet a fleet of hugely impactful, foreign owned vessels that provide next to no social, economic or environmental benefits to our coastal communities are licenced to fish in our waters whilst the powers that be decide on longer term access.

However, the case was re-investigated by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in April 2015. That led to Mr Hutchings being charged with attempted murder and attempted grievous bodily harm. Mr Hutchings was arrested by police in an early morning raid at his home in Cornwall, despite having offered to attend an interview at his local police station.He was taken the same day to Northern Ireland and held in a police station for four nights, where he was questioned on 15 separate occasions, which his lawyers pointed out to the PPSNI was five more than the mass murderer Dr Harold Shipman. Mr Hutchings’s solicitors described the circumstance of his arrest and detention “unlawful and oppressive” and point out that proceedings were brought against the PSNI in the High Court in London over the matter. The High Court ruled that where a soldier is prepared to attend a voluntary interview at a local police station there are no lawful grounds to arrest him.The prosecution case is that Mr Hutchings fired at Mr Cunningham as he was running away from soldiers seeking to question him.It is claimed by the prosecution that two soldiers fired a total of five rounds, although there is no longer any forensic evidence and it cannot be said which soldier was responsible for Mr Cunningham’s death.Mr Hutchings has always maintained he fired into the air to warn Mr Cunningham.In this letter to the PPSNI Mr Hutchings’s solicitor, Philip Barden, of Devonshires, states: “In 1974, three people were identified as being in the field when Mr Cunningham was shot. The only person still alive is Dennis Hutchings. He is the accused and the sole witness to events that day. “Dennis Hutchings\u0027s case is that he fired aimed air shots. This was a practice used in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. There are no witness who contradict Dennis Hutchings\u0027s account.”The letter adds: “The sole witness who made a statement in 1975, Soldier C, said that he saw Mr Cunningham reach into his jacket and he was then shot. He could not say who shot him. The legal question is what evidence is there that Mr Cunningham was shot at by Dennis Hutchings. The answer is none.”Mr Hutchings says he has been “betrayed” by the British authorities over the decision to prosecute him for the death of Mr Cunningham, despite an earlier assurance no such prosecution would take place.In November 1974 he received a letter from the British Army’s Legal Services saying that the then Director of Public Prosecutions “has directed that there is to be no prosecution of any military personnel arising out of this incident”.Mr Hutchings\u0027s trial is due to go ahead at Belfast Crown Court in front of a judge sitting without a jury under Diplock rules designed to prevent the intimidation of juries. He is in need of kidney dialysis on a regular basis and will require treatment throughout the duration of the trial. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"miniature root vegetables dandelion leaves replace potatoes","story":"Potatoes and lettuce will have to be replaced in the UK by small, mustardy root vegetables and dandelion leaves as a warming climate means we cannot rely on traditional crops, Kew Gardens has said.Horticulturalists and scientists at the gardens are working to see which food plants can be grown to resist increasing pests and diseases, sunnier summers and warmer, wetter winters.Next week, a new TV show exploring the secrets of the gardens will launch on Channel 5, showing how gardeners and scientists worked together during lockdown.Helena Dove, who runs the Kitchen Garden at the facility, grows crops selected by scientists to see how they fare in a British garden plot.She said that potato blight, a disease which can wipe out the whole crop, is becoming more common because of a warmer climate in this country. At some point it may become unviable to grow them, she and other horticulturists and scientists at Kew believe.Traditional potatoes are becoming very hard to grow because of blight, she said.Two strange-looking, knobbly little roots are being trialed instead, as they fare better in a warm climate and are resistant to blight.The gardener explained: We have been trying to grow root vegetables that could be substituted in the future. One we grow is oculus tuberosa, and tropaeolum tuberosum - the former is a little lemony root, it does really well, we are breeding it in the UK to make it more suitable for our climate. We also have a mustardy root crop, and sweet potatoes are doing well as well. They could be a replacement. We won’t know for tens of years but we have to start somewhere.Many who tried to grow lettuces during last year\u0027s heatwave will have noticed it was an uphill battle. These hot summers are becoming more common, so Ms Dove is working to find hardier alternatives to the salad crop.She said: Lettuces bolt when it gets hot so we may not be able to grow them in hot dry summers. We are growing tropical leaves, orache, tree spinach, they are traditionally grown for their grain but the leaves are edible so they sort of replace spinach. We are also growing dandelion which have really bitter but delicious leaves. They will keep growing through anything. We are trialling all this for salad in the kitchen garden. Another new way of gardening she is experimenting with is container planting, for those who do not have vegetable patches but want to grow their own food.In the kitchen garden, she is growing a new breed of butternut squash which can fit in a pot, and a mini peach tree which will produce a handful of fruits each year.Ms Dove explained: The windowsill crops and container planting are a real trend at the moment - we are developing butternut squashes you can grow in a pot - usually they need a lot of room but these work in a pot. We are in conversation with people to get smaller cultivars to try to get crops that often need a lot of space. I am trialling dwarf peaches and dwarf nectarines that can be grown in a pot. I have this beautiful little tree that will give me 10 peaches this year.

The board was only told the name of the buyer in November. The painting, which is now owned by Mr Ross, is currently in storage and will be hung in time for the new season.  Asked if the Opera House knew that Mr Ross was the buyer of the picture when it was sold at auction, a spokesman said: No”.  Friends of Mr Ross said he had informed the Opera House within the required time about his secret purchase of the painting.  They said that he had decided to step in anonymously to buy the painting at auction to “save it for the nation” because he was worried that it would be sold to a foreign buyer.  However, sources in the arts world said that this had caused some disappointment among some trustees who had hoped that he was going to make a separate substantial donation, in addition to any proceeds for the sale of the painting.Trustees of the Royal Opera House, based in Covent Garden, central London, are expected to donate a proportion of their earnings to the charity. One senior source at the Opera House who is close to Mr Ross claimed that he could have been more open about his intentions regarding the Hockney.  The source told The : “There may be things that he might wish he had communicated differently or done differently but his intentions were good.”  The Opera House denied that Mr Ross’s appointment as chairman had been “conditional” in his making a separate substantial donation.  A spokesman said: “David\u0027s appointment was not conditional on a donation, although he has subsequently pledged.”  Mr Ross, who made his fortune as the co-founder of high street chain Carphone Warehouse, is now planning to move the painting to the National Portrait Gallery when it reopens after a refurbishment in 2023.  Friends of Mr Ross said the painting will “remain available to the public” and will be on display either at the Opera House or the National Portrait Gallery “for the foreseeable future”.  The friend added: “He has since pledged to give money to the Royal Opera House because for every single charity he has ever chaired or been involved with he has given extremely generous donations to.”  Mr Ross is now hoping ministers will ask him to stay on at the National Portrait Gallery to ensure that pictures, paintings and portraits with links to the UK’s colonial past are rehung, and not left in the store room because of any controversial content.  The friend added: “David is passionate about making our arts and culture accessible to all so that we can all learn from our country’s history.  “We should be extremely proud about the many achievements of earlier generations but we must also seek to understand where they got things wrong.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can

into the Indian Ocean on Sunday in one of the largest uncontrolled re-entries of a spacecraft in history. No one is believed to have been injured, but the incident prompted NASA to criticise China for “failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris” and a lack of transparency. People in Jordan, Oman and Saudi Arabia reported spotting the debris in the dawn skies, which crashed into the ocean at 0224 GMT near the Males, according to coordinates reported by Chinese state media. China’s space agency said that most of the core section of its Long March 5B rocket burned up on re-entry into Earth\u0027s atmosphere.The news ended days of speculation about where debris from the rocket\u0027s core section, which was 30 metres long and 21 tonnes heavy, would land.Chinese state media had dismissed worries that the rocket was out of control and could cause damage as “Western hype”.But NASA’s administrator, Bill Nelson, said in a statement: “China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris”.“Spacefaring nations must minimize the risks to people and property on Earth of re-entries of space objects and maximize transparency regarding those operations,” said Mr Nelson, a former senator and astronaut. “It is critical that China and all spacefaring nations and commercial entities act responsibly and transparently in space to ensure the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of outer space activities.”While the debris was most likely to land on water – which covers most of the Earth’s surface – it could have potentially landed at any point as far north as Beijing, Madrid and New York, and as far south as southern Chile and Wellington in New Zealand.  “An ocean reentry was always statistically the most likely,” said Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell on Twitter. “It appears China won its gamble… But it was still reckless.”He said it was the joint fourth biggest uncontrolled re-entry on record. Most countries have tried to design their spacecrafts to avoid uncontrolled re-entries since large chunks of the NASA space station Skylab fell from orbit and landed in Australia in 1979. It makes the Chinese rocket designers look lazy that they didn\u0027t address this, Mr McDowell told Reuters.While the module separated from the launcher to continue its journey as planned, the launch vehicle’s core section also reached orbit.China’s military-backed space programme has not explained why the section didn’t fall back to earth soon after separating from its payload, which is usual in such operations.  The Long March 5B’s first launch in May last year also ended with an uncontrolled re-entry.Debris from what had been an 18-tonne core section passed over the US and landed in the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa, with pieces also damaging several buildings in the Ivory Coast. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to

But are things really that simple  More than , council seats in England were up for grabs in this week’s elections. So were the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament,  police commissioners,  mayors, the London Assembly and the Hartlepool by-election.While Keir Starmer ’s failings in the Red Wall have rightly been well-publicised, the results were always going to be complicated.So we’ve compiled a guide to the results below - taking you through not just big news, but the important things you may have missed.  . Nicola Sturgeon has got enough seats to hold a new independence vote It’s tempting to start by talking about Labour ’s latest collapse. But by far the most important result is further north, where Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP won  out of  Scottish Parliament seats.That left her one short of an SNP majority. She failed to get key victories over Labour in Dumbarton or Tories in Aberdeenshire West. But she can claim more of a mandate than in , having won three more seats and raised her vote share by . points. And with the pro-independence Greens winning eight seats, she’s pushing for a second referendum anyway in the next four years. That could break up the UK, ending the Union that has survived more than  years.Already the battle has begun over how it’ll work - with Boris Johnson insisting there should be no separation vote. But Michael Gove has signalled the UK government is unwilling to go to the Supreme Court to stop it. . Labour are being wiped out in the aposred wallaposNow we come to England’s main story of the night - its decimation in northern and Midlands heartlands. Keir Starmer’s party lost Hartlepool, red since its creation in , in a Westminster by-election that was even worse than expected. New Conservative MP Jill Mortimer said Labour had taken the people of Hartlepool for granted as she notched up a , majority. In an even more symbolic result, Labour lost control of Durham council for the first time in a century after losing  seats.Durham was the first council to be run by Labour in . But the Tories gained  seats, building on their victory in North West Durham in the  general election.Dudley, neck-and-neck until this week, now has almost twice as many Tory seats as Labour ones. Labour also lost control of Sheffield and lost nine seats in Sunderland. Tory Ben Houchen was ed with a whopping % majority in the Tees Valley mayor election while Tory Andy Street held the West Midlands mayoralty, adding  points to his vote share despite Labour mounting a challenge.  . But all is not terrible for Labour - or great for the Tories - where in EnglandWhat’s curious about recent English elections is not just the Red Wall, where Labour’s suffering, but the so-called Blue Wall. While much of the southern map is Tory shires, these results suggest a pattern of Labour making in-roads in surprising areas. Labour seized two key mayoralties from the Tories, the West of England and Cambridgeshire  Peterborough, increasing the party’s vote share by  points and  points respectively. New West of England mayor Dan Norris even thanked Keir Starmer in his speech, while Cambridgeshire  Peterborough’s new red mayor Nik Johnson won despite his party coming third behind the Lib Dems last time. Cambridgeshire council also slipped from the Tories’ grasp, with Labour and the Lib Dems both gaining. This success in the south was not universal. Labour’s Sadiq Khan was re-elected London mayor but with a vote share down  points.And the Tories kept most of their southern strongholds - plus seized control of Harlow, Essex, from Labour. But the Tories did lost  seats in Surrey, and lost control of Tunbridge Wells after a Lib Dem push. In West Sussex meanwhile, Labour more than doubled their seat tally.... to nine. All this appears to point to a redrawing of England’s election map after decades of tradition. . Thereaposs actually a slight swing towards Labour since This week’s results were comparing Labour to its local elections performance in  and . One theory is that Labour sank much further between then and , and has risen since, but not by the same amount. Pollster Patrick English of YouGov said analysis of , ‘key wards’ implied a three-point swing to Labour since . If applied unormly across Britain, it would mean a smaller Commons Tory majority with  seats, and  Labour ones. That would support Keir Starmer’s narrative that he’s leading Labour on a slow path to recovery after the  election disaster. Analysis is to be taken with a pinch of salt, though - as this week’s results show there is no unorm set of thinking in the UK. . The Green Party have quietly been the biggest success of the nightYou won’t have seen it on the front pages, but the Green Party is celebrating a surge in the local election results. As more people cycle, walk and appreciate nature in the pandemic, and as left-wingers have jitters about Labour, the party gained  council seats with most declared - more than doubling its total. In the Scottish Parliament, the Greens added three seats to their tally to reach eight. In the London Assembly they have three of  seats, up one, and candidate Sian Berry was a strong third in the capital’s mayor race. She finished with almost % of first-choice votes, up two points and way ahead of the Lib Dem who lost her deposit.  Ms Berry said: “It is a serious mandate for the ideas we were putting in front of the public this campaign - rent controls, flat fares, and a higher living wage.” Sandy Hore-Ruthven lost her bid to unseat Labour’s mayor of Bristol, but she raised the Greens’ vote share by  points and came a strong second. It’s been suggested that the Greens eating into left-wing Labour votes could be partly to blame for Keir Starmer’s woes. This isn’t just a general fringe party thing either. By comparison, the Lib Dems were pretty static - down  council seats with most results declared.. Wales was a success story for Labour - bucking Englandaposs trendAll  seats were up for grabs in the Welsh Parliament. Polls had suggested Labour - while the biggest party - had an uphill struggle to win an overall majority. But the party did not suffer the collapse seen in England at all, winning  of the Senedd seats and allowing Mark Drakeford to stay on as First Minister. Only one of Walesapos so-called red wall seats, the Vale of Clwyd, fell to the Welsh Conservatives, and the party also unseated the former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood in Rhondda. Wrexham, meanwhile, remained a marginal brick in Labour’s ‘red wall’ with a slightly higher majority. Voters flocked to the two main parties, with Labour and Tories each raising their constituency vote share by % overall since .  . Scottish Labour are fairly pleased with themselves, tooIt helps that Scottish Labour set their expectations low, only hoping for a “strong third” behind the SNP and Tories. But those were surpassed, with Labour notching up a % vote share in constituencies - only just behind the Conservatives - and % in the regional list. Leader Anas Sarwar’s  seats are behind the -seat tally achieved in . Labour’s vote share was also down since  across the board. But insiders insist overall, this is a boost since the  wipeout. Mr Sarwar also knocked a very slight dent in Nicola Sturgeon’s vote share in a publicity-grabbing run against her in her own seat. And Labour clung on in ultra-marginal Dumbarton, where deputy leader Jackie Baillie held out to deny the SNP a majority. There’s a long, long, long way to go, but Scottish Labour have not collapsed completely - and low expectations were met.  . It was a bad night for fringesNigel Farage’s latest outfit Reform UK had won just two council seats in the entire country with most of the , results declared. Anti-‘woke’ controversialist Laurence Fox won .% of the vote in London, more than Count Binface but losing his £, deposit. He was pipped to the post by YouTuber Niko Omiilana, who ran on a policy of cutting Freddos to p and telling the PM to “shush”. Alex Salmond missed out on any Scottish Parliament seats with his new outfit Alba, which he now suggests he won’t lead for long. UKIP had also lost all five of the seats it was defending at the time of writing.  And it was a good night for incumbentsOne thread that unites many of these clashing results is a boost for incumbents - politicians who were already in the job. And perhaps that’s not too surprising, as Brits looked for a stable “devil you know” in a time of crisis. It may be true too that the success of the vaccine rollout prompted some to reward sitting politicians, especially the Tories.

Boris Johnson is expected on Monday to announce that loved ones not from the same household or bubble can legally embrace one another from May  - the first time in  months. Mr Johnson is likely to say that everyone should use their “personal judgment” and their “common sense, and it depends on infections remaining low ahead of that key lockdown date, the Sundayreports. Downing Street played down but did not deny the reports last night, claiming no decisions had been made.But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove confirmed the plan is to restore hugging from May  between friends and family.  “As we move into Stage Three of our roadmap, it will be the case that we will see people capable of meeting indoors, he told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show. “And without prejudice to a broader review of social distancing, it is also the case that friendly contact - intimate contact - between friends and family is something we want to see restored.” Askedthat meant hugging from May , he replied: “Yes”. The advice on hugging will be separate to a wider review of social distancing, including in pubs and restaurants - which will only take effect from June  at the earliest. It comes at the same time people in England will be allowed indoor gatherings of up to six people and overnight stays. Mr Johnson had always intended to give an update on hugging ahead of the May  roadmap change, and itaposs thought he will confirm the details in a pm press conference tomorrow. The roadmap said: As soon as possible, and no later than Step , the Government will update its advice on social distancing between friends and family, including hugging. Mr Johnson will remove the -mourner cap on funerals, a month earlier than planned – but there is expected to be a -person limit on weddings, receptions and wakes. Pubs and restaurants, which have endured a torrid  months, will be allowed to reopen their doors to let customers inside - but social distancing measures will stay. Indoor hospitality venues such as cinemas and music venues permitted to open - but they wonapost be able to operate at full capacity just yet. Pubs and restaurants will also be allowed to let customers in, having been permitted to serve punters outdoors for the last month.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe Hartlepool defeat for Labour was upsetting, but it didn’t surprise me. The pandemic squeezed the politics out of the campaign with people in forgiving mood towards the Government following last year’s bad mistakes. Freshly vaccinated voters were showing little anger, just a desire to pull together and get through it all. I say little anger, butI am honest, where I did detect this, it was directed more at Labour than the government. As I revisited areas where I used to receive strong political support, I was told that Labour had lost its way. What do you think  Have your say below Jeremy Corbyn still casts a long shadow. A woman voter in Chaucer Avenue told me: “I cannot believe I am telling you this but I voted Tory because of Corbyn.” When I told her Keir Starmer is very dferent, she snapped back: “You will have to prove it – you can earn my vote before I come back.” There was more like this. The message was clear: Labour needs to get its act together. Locally too, they were disillusioned with Labour councillors who were aloof from them, speaking a language that owed more to far-left platitudes than their everyday lives.  Despite the disappointment of the by-election loss, we are now going to see the re-building of Labour’s reputation locally, and similar fightbacks are taking place in many former Labour strongholds as Starmer supporters gain the upper hand over Corbyn’s army of zealots. ButI take away one abiding impression, it is that in towns like Hartlepool the political kaleidoscope has turned and Labour is not going to recover by attempting to bring back the past. A new model Labour party is being demanded by voters, who themselves have moved on.  In smart and proud former council houses now occupied by their owners, voters want a Labour party that understands their aspiration, believes in social justice, knows this has to be paid for and will ensure that fair rules apply to all – from hard-working welfare recipients to the rich and privileged. They want to be heard, not talked down to, and they want to get behind policies they feel are genuinely useful and relevant to improving their lives. Labour has not spoken to these voters for over a decade since Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were prime ministers.

UK minister Michael Gove today repeatedly refused to rule out trying to block a referendum bid - which could tear apart the Union of the UK - in the Supreme Court.He signalled the UK government would not do so, saying “of course” Scotland is allowed to leave the UK, but refused to clary. Ms Sturgeon said she “heard him say” that the UK government would not fight a legal bid for a referendum in the courts. She intends to press ahead with legislation for a new independence vote, seven years after losing the last one in . Ms Sturgeon said: There is a fundamental issue of democracy here. We have just won a landslide. I am being asked to answer the question aposwhat do you doa UK Government refuses point blank to accept democracyapos. That is just an absurd position for anybody to be put into. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I think it would be absurd and completely outrageousit ever got to that point -it ever got anywhere close to that point. “Because remember, for this to end up in court - which is not something I ever want to see - it would mean a Conservative government had refused to respect the democratic wishes of the Scottish people and the outcome of a democratic election, and tried to go to the Supreme Court to overturn Scottish democracy.” She added any attempt to block a referendum would be “a grave and serious and undemocratic situation” and accused the UK government of showing a “lack of respect for Scottish democracy”.  The SNP won  out of the  seats in the Scottish Parliament, and the pro-independence Greens also won eight seats. Today the triumphant First Minister said there was a clear mandate for an independence vote in the next four years. And SNP deputy leader Keith Brown even signalled Scotland could trigger a wildcat vote. He saidNo scuppered another independence vote, “I believe the referendum will still happen”.Mr Gove repeatedly refused to sayBoris Johnson will try to block a second independence vote in the courts.The Cabinet Office minister was asked three times by Sky Newsthe Prime Minister could go to court to halt any bid from the Scottish Parliament. But rather than ruling it out he said “we’re not going to go there” and “we’re not even going there at the moment.” He also refused to saythere were any circumstances in which Boris Johnson would agree to a second referendum. Instead he replied: Itaposs not an issue for the moment. Of course, the people of Scotland, as we saw in the referendum in , they have that right, but it is absolutely important that we concentrate now on the issues in front of us. Of course, one of the things to bear in mind is that while Nicola Sturgeon obviously secured a good result, the SNP did not get a majority in this election as they did in .

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeSitting in the Italian restaurant, the three of us laughing and talking, anyone would have thought we’d been close forever.I think of Jane and Teresa as old friends now, introduced to me by my mam. And in a way, that’s true.Without donating Mam’s organs, I’d never have had the chance to make two such amazing friends. My whole world collapsed when my mam Tish died of a brain aneurysm, aged . When I couldn’t get hold of her on Mother’s Day , I drove to her house with my partner Paul.I found her sitting in the kitchen, confused and not herself, so I called an ambulance.We were assured it was simply a water infection, so I kissed her goodbye, saying I’d be back in the morning. Back home, I got a call. Her scan had been reviewed – there was a mass in her brain. By the next morning, she had been diagnosed with the brain aneurysm and slipped into a coma.“I’m afraid she won’t recover,” the consultant said. I heard wailing from somewhere – and realised it was coming from me.I just couldn’t believe that this was happening to my lovely mam. Growing up, it was always just us two. Money was tight but my childhood was full of fun. She loved music, especially classical and jazz, naming me after Ella Fitzgerald. She was a talented social photographer who took thousands of images and had an exhibition of her work in London.Wherever we went, she’d have her camera round her neck and I’d have my own little camera. Mam was an inspiration. She was so happy when I told her she was going to be a grandmother. When Dexter, now nine, was born, her le revolved around him.  The right thing to doAs I tried to process the devastating news that Mam wasn’t coming back, the doctors askedI’d consider organ donation. Though we’d never discussed it, I knew straight away it was the right thing. Mam was spiritual, saying the soul carries on. One of  children, everything was passed on and handed down in Tish’s family. It was as though I could hear her saying she wouldn’t want her organs going to waste.So in the early hours of the following morning, the organ team arrived to go through the donation process. Every single organ had to be agreed – lungs, kidney, pancreas, heart. I was told people can be reluctant to agree to the eyes being donated. But as a photographer, Mam had such good eyes, I wanted someone to benefit from them too.If Mam had to die, I wanted as many people to be helped as possible. For two days I sat with Mam, holding her hand and brushing her hair. It was heart-breaking but I whispered, “Don’t worry, I can do it on my own, you can go.” Then they declared brain stem death, meaning she would never regain consciousness or breathe without support. The following day, Mam’s birthday, I got a call from the donation team. Mam’s organs had been accepted and the recipients would receive them that very day. It was incredibly comforting. A few weeks later, just as I came home with Mam’s ashes, I opened a letter saying that Mam’s “gts” had saved the lives of four other women and the sight of two men. I was absolutely thrilled. I hadn’t expected to hear anything  but a few months later, I got two letters via the donation team. Jane had received Mam’s lungs and Teresa a kidney and pancreas, and they were both full of thanks. I wrote straight back excitedly. Although the donation team doesn’t encourage meeting up, in case the relationship turns sour for any reason, we found each other through social media and stayed in touch.I met up with Jane and her mum when they drove up to see us, and we had the longest hug in the car park.Later, I met Teresa and her family for a day out at Legoland.

Around a third of people with coronavirus show no symptoms, so can infect others without even knowing they’ve been ill. Rapid testing is a vital tool to make sure people know when to self isolate so they break the chain of transmission. Alex, , from Hemel Hempstead, works for JamVans, a removal company that provides Covid- tests for its employees. He was experiencing no symptoms at all when he tested positive for Covid. “We move people’s homes on a daily basis, and also have a delivery contract with a local hospice – it has about  charity stores, and we help them move all the stock,” says Alex. “One morning before work I did a rapid Covid- test outside the hospice, then sat in my van waiting for the results. I’d done a few of these tests, and thought it would be fine as I didn’t have a single symptom – but then the test came back positive.”  “I spoke to the hospice on the phone from outside the building, and they told me I had to go for a PCR test. My company booked me in with a private firm and I went straight there. Our company policy is that we have to wear a mask in people’s houses and throughout our offices, and I stick to the guidelines as much as I can, so at first I thought the rapid flow test must be wrong. But within an hour, I was told I definitely had Covid. I couldn’t quite believe it.” Alex was able to isolate straightaway, ensuring he wasn’t spreading Covid to any vulnerable people he came into contact with. “I stopped working to self-isolate on full pay, and still didn’t develop any symptoms at all,” he says. “Without the test, I definitely would have carried on working, which is why it’s so important to have regular tests, evenyou haven’t got any symptoms. I had the virus and I felt fine, but imagineI’d given it to my parents, my grandparents or my colleagues  “If I’m driving between  charity shops, with three or four people in each shop, I could have been quite a spreader. I would have put a lot of people at risk, who may not be as young and healthy as I am – you never know who you’re passing it on to. It might sound dramatic, but in my case, taking the test could have saved lives. I haven’t had the jab yet, but I will as soon as I can – and I’ll still be taking two tests a week.Get into the testing habit More than half the adults in the UK have had at least one dose of Covid vaccination and lockdown restrictions are beginning to ease. But the virus is still out there and around a third of all the people who are infected do not show any symptoms. Regular rapid testing is vital to break the chain of transmission – now all adults are advised to do two tests a week. Rapid testing kits are free and you can do them at home, with results appearing within just  minutes. If you test positive, you’ll be able to isolate straightaway rather than risk spreading Covid to others. Millions of people have already made regular home testing part of their routine, as secondary school children and their parents have been able get free tests since February, but now everyone is encouraged to play their part. Every test helps to put your mind at rest and helps protect people around you as the country moves out of lockdown. Around one in three people with coronavirus has no symptoms. Rapid Covid-tests are for people who aren’t showing symptoms. If you’re showing symptoms , order a PCR test. Test twice a week, or every three or four days: it’s the best way to catch a case of Covid- at the point it becomes highly infectious.If you test positive you should self-isolate immediately and visit nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a PCR test that will confirm the result.If you test negative, you must still follow the Hands, Face, Space and Fresh Air rules to minimise the spread of Covid-. Rapid tests are easy to use and give results within  minutes. It’s important to report your results online straightaway, whether the test is positive, negative or even void. It’s easy to do at gov.uk report-covid-result or by calling .More than m rapid tests have been taken since October , and hundreds of thousands of positive cases among people with no symptoms have been picked up. Information from the rapid tests is kept anonymous, and scientists use it to spot patterns and outbreaks more quickly and accurately, helping to reduce the risk of future lockdowns. Even though you might have already had one or two doses of vaccine, there’s a chance you could still give Covid to someone , as no vaccine is  per cent effective. So it’s vital to test twice weekly as well as continuing to follow social distancing guidance, washing hands, wearing a face covering and letting fresh air in. Rapid Covid- tests are suitableyou have no symptoms of Covid .“Remember, around a third of people with coronavirus have no symptoms, but could be spreading it to others without knowing,” says GP Dr Amir Khan. “Rapid testing is effective at detecting people who are infectious and enabling us to find Covid- cases that we otherwise would not know about. This helps us in our efforts to stop the spread of the virus. Testing regularly even when you have no symptoms means we can keep infection levels low and our country safe, and the good thing is they give a result within  minutes.” And, as Dr Khan notes, the tests are very reliableyou do them correctly. “Testing ourselves for coronavirus using rapid Covid- tests is vital in keeping ourselves and others safe from coronavirus and keeping infection rates in our communities low. When done correctly, the tests are at least . per cent specic, which means the risk of  positives is extremely low – less than one in a thousand. This means it is a very good test.”‘All I had was a mild sore throat’ Kim Tobin, from Southend, Essex, works in a supermarket and had a positive Covid- test in January  Routine rapid testing in the workplace helped Kim, , discover she had Covid, even though she was showing no symptoms. Without the test, she could have spread it to her workmates and customers.“I had a very, very mild sore throat, just a little scratch and that was it,” she says. “I didn’t even think anything of it. I was all dressed for work, ready to go. Then I went and had the test, and after  minutes the lady who had done it came up to me and said, ‘You need to go home right now because you’ve got it – you’ve tested positive.’”"},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan trolling world unclear","story":"NewsHarry and Meghan ‘trolling the world’ with unclear snaps of Archie, says royal authorPrince Harry and Meghan Markle quit the royal family in January last year and sightings of Archie have been few and far between ever since with the couple said to be determined for him to have as normal a childhood as possiblemirrorShareCommentsByTom Davidson:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video meghan-harry-celebrate-son-archies-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZMoTDY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The duke and duchess put out a picture of Archie for his second birthday but it was blurry with a filter over it - so you could barely see the toddler. That compares with the clear and focused pictures that Prince William and Kate Middleton regularly release for their three children - Princess Charlotteaposs recent photo for her th birthday for example. Omid Scobie, who wrote the biography Finding Freedom, says the decision for a blurry and out of focus photo for Archieaposs nd birthday was entirely deliberate. What is your view on this story  Let us know in the comments below This was, as I think weaposve come to experience from the Sussexes, a photo of Archie but not too clear, he said on his On Heir podcast. I think this is their way of trolling the world. When Meghan announced her second pregnancy, she released a picture where she cuddling Archie - but his head was hidden. Omid praised the Sussexes for dressing Archie in jeans and Nikes - saying it was a change from the more more traditional style of his cousins.  A post on the Royal Familyaposs official Instagram and Twitter pages read: Wishing Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a very happy nd birthday today. In another gushing post, shared on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs official accounts, Wills and Kate wrote: Wishing Archie a very happy nd birthday today, followed by a balloon and cake emoji. They shared a family snap taken on Archieaposs Christening when he was just two-months old, featuring the entire family together.  Meanwhile Prince Charles and Camilla shared a loving photo of the Prince of Wales with his son and grandson, writing: Happy birthday to Archie, who turns two today. It has been reported that royal aides were left feeling uncomfortable about the fact none of them had an up-to-date photo of Archie with most from shortly after his birth or his christening. Meghan is pregnant with her second child - a girl.

The parents, of Morecambe, Lancashire, wrote on Instagram : It was Ellie’s th birthday yesterday so today we surprised her with this.Happy birthday Ellie we hope you have the best night sweetheart. The couple, who donapost rely on benefits, spend an estimated £, a year of their own money bringing up their children - including birthdays with a reported budget of £ per child and Christmas at £ to £ per child. They say on the morning of each of their kidsapos birthdays, the whole family gather in the living room. The child is given a pile of presents, which often include sweets, clothes, toys and sports gear. These gts are usually from the whole family, rather than  dferent gts from each sibling. Sue, , fancies herself as a demon wrapper and is the one in charge of wrapping and hiding the kidsapos pressies. But Noel, a professional baker who runs his own bakery, usually whips up the birthday cake at the family house, which used to be a care home.   The family sometimes buys extra-special cakes for milestone birthdays. Before lockdown, the supersized family enjoyed birthday meals in restaurants, cocktails and even holidays. The weekly food bill for the family usually comes in at around £ but they splash out even more for birthdays, treating the kids to a meal out or ordering a huge takeaway for everyone.

Hayley Rowson, from Abergele in Wales, claims to have earned almost £, since the start of the year by uploading pictures and videos to the OnlyFans website.The courier delivery driver has also been able to reduce her working hours since she began selling photographs and footage, priced from £ and a subscription fee of £. per month, reports the Daily Post. With the money she has made so far, Hayley has recently purchased a red London bus for £, and is in the process of converting it in order to move from her home in Abergele and live on the road with her three cats and dog. Hayley said: Iaposve had a bad few years, recently selling my house after financial dficulties Iaposve always liked the idea of living on the road. Initially I was looking at a container conversion but liked the idea of a bus. I approached a bus company in Holywell and asked themthey had any busses they would like to sell - thankfully, they had the London bus as it does not comply with guidelines from local councils so it wasnapost being used. My OnlyFans success, I think is mainly down to the fact that I talk to my subscribers and I answer their messages promptly. Effectively itaposs like a business, so regardless of the industry, customer service is key. I upload at least three times per day to ensure my content is fresh and people are getting value for their money.  People need to realise that there is more to le than working early hours until late at night, there are other ways to make money and your body is the biggest asset you have, people should be proud to show it off.

Keith Hurworth, , is one of  patients who contracted Mycobacterium Abscessus at the Royal Papworth Hospital – one of whom died. The bug, which is found in infected water, stays in the body and can attack the lungs and eat into bones. Keith, who was in hospital for a double lung transplant, has been told there is no cure or effective treatment for it. Andhis new lungs fail, the bug prevents him having a second transplant. The dad-of-two now wants to know why he was admitted for his op five months after the world-famous Royal Papworth declared a serious incident. Tell us what you think of this story in the comments below The infection was found in the hospital’s water supply soon after it moved to a site next to nearby Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge. Keith says he was not told about the bug before his double transplant in February . Five lung transplant patients were infected, and  people with serious lung conditions. The bug was first identied in August  and a serious incident was declared by the NHS Trust the following month.  But Keith says the first he knew about the problem was last May, when a doctor told him he was infected. Keith, from Cotgrave, near Nottingham, said: “I owe my le to Papworth but I don’t understand why they didn’t tell me. “When doctors told me I was infected, they were in tears. Everyone was so upset. I deserved to know there had been this bug in the water.” Married Keith, who is dad to Liam, , and Libby, , is now taking legal action.

I was given the gt of le and I feel like I owe it to the person who I got the lungs from to get solicitors involved. “Otherwise it feels like the lungs have been wasted.” Keith worked with cement and suffered breathing problems for years. He learned he had been infected when he went for a post-op check-up. He added: “It was devastating for me, my we and the children. I’ve been told I can’t have another transplant because once the infection is in your body, not a lot can be done.  “The bug is sitting dormant at the moment. But when it starts up, I might have only months to live. “The only drug is one that slows it down. That this outbreak has not just affected me but others as well is worrying. My family feel very upset and angry. I feel a terrible conflict in going to lawyers, but I wasn’t told about the bug. I am trying to understand why. “I deserve to knowmore could have been done to prevent me falling ill.”  Keith was also put through the wringer by Covid but a steroid drug saved his le. Clare Pearson, of lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said: “This has had a major impact on Keith and caused great concern among other patients. While we welcome the fact the Trust identied areas for future action, it is worrying that Keith contracted his infection six months after the first cases were identied.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i want meet cannibal who","story":"NewsI want to meet cannibal who killed my sister and ate her leg so I can look him in eyesEXCLUSIVE: Michael Paterson aims to sit down with David Harker after he strangled Julie Paterson, , in  and ate her leg in a scene police likened to Silence of the LambsmirrorShareCommentsByDan WarburtonReporter for the Sunday Mirror and People:,  MAY NewsMurder victim Julie Patersons leg was eaten by cannibal David Harker\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Michael Paterson aims to sit down face-to-face with David Harker as part of the restorative justice programme. Harker strangled Julie Paterson, , in  and ate her leg in a scene police likened to Silence of the Lambs, in which Sir Anthony Hopkins played killer Hannibal Lecter. For more than two decades Harker has refused to reveal what he did with other body parts – even taunting his victim’s family from prison with cruel notes. Grieving Michael, , told the Sunday People: “I want to go to prison, look Harker in the eyes, and demand to know what he did with my sister. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “I can’t move on with my le until I know. He is sick. I want him to tell me what he did with Julie’s body so I can move on with my le. He shouldn’t be released until that happens.” Harker, then aged , pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Julie in Darlington on the grounds of diminished responsibility. A judge at Teesside crown court sentenced him to le imprisonment with a recommendation that he should not be eligible for parole for at least  years.  But he could be freeda parole board deems he is no longer a risk. However, Michael claims Harker “prevented the lawful and decent burial” of his sister, a mother of four. And he intends to lodge a complaint with police which he hopes could spark a fresh investigation and prolong Harker’s time in prison – unless he reveals what he did with Julie’s remains. Her family raised the possibility of quizzing Harker after prison chiefs included details of the rehab process in an information pack.  No cannibal has ever been involved in a restorative justice meeting. Any summit could be part of a new parole bid – but Harker will have to agree to the meeting. A source said: “It would clearly need to be a highly secure meeting.  Harker’s crimes were unspeakable.” Restorative justice is aimed at helping victims and perpetrators. It involves offenders and people affected by the crime quizzing each other in an effort to move forward with their lives – and prevent further crimes.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeTo mark the start of Mental Health Awareness Week, the British Asian Trust and CareTech Foundation are jointly urging the British-Pakistani population to recognise and de-stigmatise mental health within their communities. I wholly support this initiative. With my own Asian background, I have experienced first-hand the devastating affect mental health has on people when it is a taboo subject – misunderstood, ignored and brushed under the carpet. We cannot allow this situation to carry on because not recognising the importance of mental health has a wider impact on all society. My parents and countless other first-generation British Pakistanis grew up in a culture that doesn’t acknowledge mental health. I remember my own trauma when I realised I might be made to marry someone my parents chose for me. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  It consumed my thoughts as an -year-old. I couldn’t talk to my parents about it because they would have been ashamed of me, and I couldn’t talk to my teachers and friends because they didn’t understand my culture. So I had no outlet for those feelings of fear, anxiety, anger and helplessness. Shockingly, in Pakistan, families often turn to spiritual healers, who associate mental illness with supernatural forces such as witchcraft, possession and black magic.  A child showing signs of misbehaviour or a woman not adhering to the cultural norms would be taken to one of these healers to rid them of the “gin” or evil spirit. The UK has accessible mental health services with more than , registered therapy professionals. Yet many in the UK’s Pakistani communities don’t reach out for help for fear of judgement. In one UK study, middle-aged Pakistani men and older Indian and Pakistani women reported signicantly higher rates of depression than white people. It angers me that the western-educated Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has not used his  to address the mental health of his population, which could in turn have a positive impact on the Asian community here in the UK.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice A glamour model has been left scarred for le after she was stabbed with a screwdriver by another woman in a revenge attack.Stacy Dolan, , suffered a puncture wound to the left side of the face below the eye, a cm laceration on the left knee, and bruising and swelling to the upper right arm after the attack. She was stabbed by -year-old Sharon Mather, who had confronted her inside her own home and accused her of taking advantage of a friend who gave the victim money. Now Ms Dolan, who has posed for a string of publications including Front magazine, Twisted Edge and the Daily Sport, claims she is disfigured and can no longer pose for close up facial pictures due to a scar on her lip. The mum of two, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, said: Since the incident, it has affected my confidence and the way I am. It has made me more conscious of being alone. I now no longer use my front door to enter or leave my house. My injuries have healed but the injury to my face has left me feeling like I have nerve damage to my top lip, it feels like I always have a fat lip. There is still a slight scar that can be seen close up but can be covered with makeup. However, I am aware of the fact that I have this scar and I am now really conscious of it. I am also conscious of how this has affected my modelling career and I know now that I can no longer accept work that requires me to have close up face shots. I have two small scars on my leg that I am conscious of. I also feel the scar on my face may have lost me work.  Mather, a former carer, was jailed for five and a half years at Bolton Crown Court after she was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The jury heard Mather was drunk and angry when she repeatedly attacked Ms Dolan in Wigan, while one of the victimaposs young kids slept upstairs. Sentencing the thug, judge Miss Recorder Alexandra Simmonds told her: You were intent on remonstrating with Miss Dolan because you thought she had taken advantage of a friend of yours. It seemed you were drunk and angry and you started arguing with some money which she had taken from your friend. Miss Dolan did not know what you were talking about at first and wanted you to leave. The two of you had been friends before this night, but something had clearly upset you. The state you were in meant you were not prepared to listen to her. You had a screwdriver in your hand, you struck out at her several times causing three wounds. It was the final injury to her face that perhaps brought you to your senses as you then fled the property, realising what a terrible thing you had done. Miss Dolan sought help from a neighbour and the police were called yet you roamed the streets and ended up at the house of an elderly gentleman who you had cared for in the past. He was extremely concerned about the state that you were in and he thought you had taken drugs or been very drunk. You told him that you had stabbed Miss Dolan and at first, he didnapost believe you. He advised you to go to the police, but you didnapost. Instead, you left his house and hid at a friendaposs house. You turned yourself in a few days later, your friend was concerned you might commit suicide. Miss Dolan is more conscious about being alone in the house, while her injuries have healed, she has some altered sensation in her top lip and there is a slight scar from her face, which she is conscious of because of her modelling career. It is clear you regret your decision to go round to Miss Dolanaposs house that night and I am prepared to accept that your behaviour that night was wholly out of character - almost certainly having been affected by the alcohol you had drank that night. You are going to find the prison environment very dficult to cope with given your mental health dficulties.  The jury heard Ms Dolan and Mather fell out in July  when Mather believed Miss Dolan had taken money from a mutual friend. In the early hours of July  that year, Mather went round to Ms Dolanaposs home and the attack followed. As the victim ran to a neighbouraposs home for help, Mather fled the scene and went to the home of an elderly man she previously cared for and confessed she had stabbed the victim. He advised her to go to police but Mather instead hit at another friendaposs house before surrendering to police a few days later. She later denied wrongdoing. Katie Jones, prosecuting, said: This was a sustained assault on one victim who sustained three injuries. There were children present, but they were asleep upstairs. The offence was committed whilst the defendant was drunk or possibly high. At the time Miss Dolan had been starting out in her modelling career.

The big-hearted Britain’s Got Talent stars have each given five-figure sums to help the nine-year-old, after we ­revealed his parents must raise £, by Wednesday for a le-saving stem cell transplant. Manchester United and Marvel fan Nathaniel is not entitled to free NHS treatment because he is not a British national.He was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in the UK after flying here for a £, prosthetic eye fitted privately after losing it to a tumour in his home country Nigeria. Simon, , whose son Eric is seven, said: “This must be a really dficult time for Nathaniel and his parents, let’s all pray that this campaign gets Nathaniel the treatment he needs.” Comedian David, , dad to Alfred, aged eight, said: “Nathaniel is a very special little boy and we must do everything we can to ensure he gets all the treatment he needs so he can enjoy a long and happy le.”You can add to the donations to help save Nathaniel via this GoFundMe pageGenerous Sunday People readers helped raise £, earlier this year for three rounds of chemo at Great Ormond Street Hospital in March to get him in shape for the le-saving op. He responded better than consultants expected and is in remission and in a position for a transplant, using donor stem cells from an umbilical cord. Readers have helped raise another £, last week to fund transplant procedure and doctors at GOSH have kindly waived their private fees to ­reduce the cost. But there is still another £, to find. Consultants at GOSH say his cancer couldat any time and the window for a successful op while chemotherapy is keeping the cancer at bay means the cash must be raised by Wednesday.  After that, the chances of it working will be reduced, and Nathaniel’s only likely option will be palliative care. A host of stars have rallied around to support Nathaniel as the family race to raise cash. Former JLS singer Aston Merrygold, Paul O’Grady and Loose Women’s Coleen Nolan were among those backing the lad.Dad-of-two Aston, , shared the appeal with his k Instagram followers, urging them: “Please help Nathaniel’s family”.Reality star Katie Price shared a fundraising page with her . million Instagram followers and called for fans to “give Nathaniel the chance for a le”.Nathaniel said he is “so grateful” for the support from readers and celebs. He said: “Thank you all, everybody, for helping me and giving me a chance at le. God bless everybody.” His parents Ebi, , and Modupe, , have been moved to tears by the support from stars and People readers.  Ebi said: “I’ve been crying knowing that the British people have given my son another hope in le again when all hope was gone. It is like a modern day miracle. We are so grateful. “We all watch American Idol as a family and Nathaniel watches videos of Simon on TikTok. He is a big fan. To David we say, thank you so much for coming to the aid of a stranger and being a Good Samaritan. We have still got to raise three-quarters of what we need. I have not been able to sleep, I worry so much about how we are going to raise the money. It is so tough.” This week, Nathaniel had tests and saw a psychologist at GOSH ahead of the potential transplant and rested at his relatives’ home in Croydon, South London. Ebi said: “So far the test results have been wonderful. He’s in top shape, he’s doing so well. He’s been playing his video games. “He knows he’s going to be in hospital for a long time and expressed his fears in a meeting with a psychologist. We are doing our best to reassure him.” Nathaniel has already overcome a lot after having his left eye removed last September while fighting another cancer, myeloid sarcoma, in southern Nigeria. His family raised £, so he could travel with Ebi to London to have a prosthetic fitted at London’s Moorfield Eye Hospital in November. Within days of arriving Nathaniel suffered nosebleeds and a fever and was rushed to Croydon University Hospital where he was diagnosed with terminal AML, which affects around  children every year in the UK. It is so aggressive he could have died within weeks without chemo. His family were initially told the total cost of the treatment at GOSH would be up to £,.  Celebrities have voiced their concern for Nathaniel after learning of his desperate situation. Corrie legend Beverley Callard: “This little boy deserves all the help we can give him, so let’s dig deep and get him the treatment he needs to save his le”.Emmerdale’s Claire King: “Please, please help Nathaniel’s family raise £,. Stay strong, Nathaniel. We are all wishing you the very best.”Coleen Nolan, Loose Women list: “What Nathaniel is going through is every family’s worst nightmare. They are so close to the treatment he desperately needs, and the kindness of strangers can help him.”Benidorm’s Sherrie Hewson: “Every child deserves the best chance at le, and while there is hope for Nathaniel, we mustn’t give up. He has shown such bravery coming this far and now he needs a chance at the treatment that could save him. I hope everyone will get behind this courageous little boy and his family to donate and give him a future.”Samantha Giles, Hollyoaks actress: “If you can manage to donate just a pound, it could potentially save Nathaniel’s le. Thank you, thank you! You’ve done something wonderful.”Entrepreneur and presenter Saira Khan: “If we can all give a little bit, we can help to save this little boy’s le.” TV and stage star Claire Sweeney: “GOSH consultants have graciously waived their fee, but we still need to raise £, for a le-saving stem cell treatment. Please dig deep – we only have three days to save this beautul boy.” The transplant treatment is not available in his home country and he was too sick to travel. Ebi and Modupe were in despair when they first spoke to us three months ago. But Sunday People readers stepped in to raise £, for chemo which has given him a chance of surviving a transplant. Clinicians have lowered costs after Nathaniel responded better than expected to treatment and needed less chemo.  And last week we revealed consultants at GOSH have waived their private fees to help Nathaniel. The £, covers the donor stem cell transplant and the cost of care, excluding consultants fees, based on a typical inpatient admission of eight weeks and a three-month post-transplant follow-up as an outpatient. Professor Ajay Vora, a consultant paediatric haematologist at GOSH, said: “All the consultants involved in his care are working in a private ­capacity and have waived their fee because they want to help him. “Our time is not borrowed from the NHS because we are treating Nathaniel in our private service in our time.”  If enough is raised for the transplant, Nathaniel will undergo tests to begin the process on Friday, May . Doctors had hoped to have a bone marrow transplant from one of his two sisters Nadia, , and Nicole,  months. But they were not a match. Ebi said: “Even to get to this point where we may have access to treatment is a miracle.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA pregnant single mum has been moved into a rat-infested council house after bravely fleeing her home due to domestic abuse. Sian Hope* and her two-year-old daughter were living in a refuge after escaping their previous lives with just the clothes on their backs in September. Birmingham City Council then offered them a two-bed end-terrace property, though they were unable to view it before moving in thanks to Covid restrictions.But nothing could have prepared Sian - who is expecting her second child in July - for what they found, reports Birmingham Live. She has described being kept awake at night by the scratching sounds, and being unable to leave food out in the kitchen. They have also seen tails scurrying along the skirting boards. We were really excited when we were offered the house but we couldnapost believe it when we moved in, Sian said.Are you in a similar predicament to Sian  Let us know at webnews@mirrorIt has a major rat and mice infestation, broken floorboards, no carpets and the loft is rotten. There are rooms with no skirting boards and gaps between the wall and the floor so big that you can see rat tails poking through as they run along. I can see the rats urinating in the walls and it seeping onto the floors. Every day I’m bleaching my kitchen. My daughter is scared to be in her own bedroom. All you can hear is scratching. The rats and mice go crazy in the loft at night. It wakes her up, she’s petried.  Sian said her clothes have been chewed and rats have bitten through the cables on her fridge freezer and broken it. She claims the council has refused to replace it, meaning she has to live off microwave meals and largely seek refuge in her bedroom where there is carpet. The council said it has sent pest control to bait all areas concerned, is planning to carry out rodent proofing works and has promised to continue to monitor and treat the property until there is no more bait being consumed. But Sian says the treatments have so far failed to have any impact, and droppings are everywhere - and dead rodents are being left for days.  Over the Bank Holiday, Sian was awoken at am to the sound of an injured mouse thrashing around inside a vase - only to be told she would have to wait until Tuesday for someone to come out. Sian said neighbours have told her there has been a rodent problem in the three-house terrace for three years, and it appears to stem from her property. My house is disgusting. I’m calling the council every other day. I’ve sent so many emails and complaints, she said. On top of the rodents, there are also heating problems with the boiler switching itself off each night meaning Sian and her daughter have constant coughs and chest infections. The health visitor has been and said it is not safe, she added.

The Queenaposs cousin told undercover reporters posing as investors from South Korea in a virtual meeting that he could be hired for £, a day to make confidential representations to Mr Putinaposs regime.The revelation was made by Channel  Dispatches in collaboration with the Sunday Times, who set up a fake South Korean gold company called House of Haedong and approached five members of the royal family with an offer of a role.Prince Michael of Kent responded showing interest in working with the company, telling undercover reporters that he would give House of Haedong his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a £, fee and was happy to use his home in Kensington Palace as a backdrop. Prince Michael is not a working member of the royal family and does not receive money from the civil list. He and his we occasionally attend royal garden parties and receptions.He earns a living acting as chairman of his own private company, which offers consultancy advice. Prince Michael was also approached about a role helping the fictitious gold firm in Russia.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here The programme said his business partner Lord Simon Reading had used an event at Kensington Palace in , in which Prince Michael was a guest, to sell access to Mr Putin. The event, to promote the Russian wrestling sport of Sambo, also offered opportunities to personally meet the Russian leader at a later date, Dispatches found. In a recorded meeting with the undercover reporters, Lord Reading said: If heis representing the House of Haedong, he could mention that to Putin and Putin would find the right person who is interested in South Korea or interested in gold. It just opens the door, you know, which is so helpful. He added: I think,I can say this, this is kind of slightly discreet, weaposre talking relatively discreetly here. Because we wouldnapost want the world to know that he is seeing Putin purely for business reasons,you follow me.  He went on to describe Prince Michael as Her Majestyaposs unofficial ambassador to Russia, and that tension between the UK and the Russian regime has not affected his relationship with Mr Putin. In a preview clip shared by Channel  on Twitter, Prince Michael is seen being asked,is acceptable, to which he says: Oh yes, very much so. Thank you, yes. Erm, very good. Thank you so much, yes. One of the reporters then asksit is in line with what he would normally charge for a speech like this. He replies: Yes, indeed, so. I have no, no questions for you on that. I am very happy with your suggestion. And erm I think that’s very good and very generous of you. Responding to programme, Prince Michaelaposs office said: Prince Michael receives no public funding and earns his own living through a consultancy company that he has run for over  years. Prince Michael has no special relationship with President Putin. They last met in June  and Prince Michael has had no contact with him or his office since then. Lord Reading is a good friend, who in trying to help, made suggestions which Prince Michael would not have wanted, or been able, to fulfil. Lord Reading said: I thought the approach from the House of Haedong was genuine and I was only trying to facilitate an introduction to my friend Prince Michael. I made a mistake and over-promised and for that, I am truly regretful. I wasnapost at my peak as I was recovering from a kidney transplant.  For the record, the Sambo event which was eight years ago was my event and Prince Michael was simply my guest along with many other people. Simon Astaire, spokesman for Prince Michael, went on to tell the Mirror: Prince Michael has long established business, charitable and cultural connections with Russia and is proud of all the work he has done for UK-Russia trade. As is standard practice, Prince Michael’s Private Secretary made it clear to the company’s representatives during their conversations that nothing could proceed without the agreement of the British Embassy and the help of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, of which Prince Michael is Patron.  Cantium Services, Prince Michaelaposs consultancy company has built up accumulated losses and continues to operate at a loss. There is therefore no corporation tax liability to pay. Prince Michael met President Alexander Lukashenko in October  during a visit to Minsk. The meeting was arranged and attended by the British Ambassador to Belarus. The visit was supported in full by the FCDO. Prince Michael is not currently conducting any business in Belarus.

Patty Hernandez, , from Charlotte, North Carolina, continued the unusual family tradition by naming her newborn Clayton. She named all of her children with the same first letter in honour of their -year-old dad Carlos. But Patty revealed that she and her husband had struggled to think up a new name beginning with aposCapos before their latest son was born. She told The Mirror: We couldnapost figure out a name and then Clayton just popped into my head. All the kids have names beginning with aposCapos and we wanted to keep that going. My husband is called Carlos... itaposs a tribute to him. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The mum said her latest pregnancy was her toughest yet, although despite this she is still open to having more children. Patty, who runs her own cleaning company, said she feels like her huge family is a aposblessingapos from God. She added: God has blessed us with all these kids, I know some people donapost agree and there are nasty comments online but for us itaposs a big blessing. I never thought I would have a big family until I started having babies. Then I thought aposthis is cool, why not apos Itaposs really fun.  If God wants us to have another child we will have another one. Carlos was by his weaposs side on May  when she delivered Clayton, who weighed lbs and  ounces. The mum was  weeks pregnant when she gave birth - her longest pregnancy yet - and she is still in hospital now. All my other births have been before  weeks. He just didnapost want to come out, she said.  The other children are anxious to meet their little brother. Iaposve been in hospital since Tuesday. They induced me on Tuesday and he came out on Wednesday. Patty said most of the nurses at the hospital recognised her when she went in for the delivery. They were like aposyou were here last year, we see you every yearapos, she said. Patty and her husband currently spend an eye-watering £ on food for their children every fortnight, however she stressed they do not receive any government support.

Initially, I was completely freaked out, said the -year-old. I think I had a sharp intake of breath. Then it was more of a aposWhat the... apos as I tried to work out what was going on.

I wouldn#t imagine there would be many clubs that have come out of the Championship and achieved that.“But we don#t believe the story is done yet and we#ll, hopefully, go to Hampden and get a positive result.”It#s not just the United boss who is up for the fight: his players are, too.Forget the carrot of European football, forget about the presence of Scotland boss Steve Clarke, all that should matter to the Terrors is cup glory.For Mellon, there is no need to motivate his troops, with the prize of kissing silver all the incentive they need.He continued: “Someone asked me after the last game: ‘Do you think you will be able to motivate the players for next weekend ’“I couldn’t believe that.

I am delighted that I am involved in such a massive game.“That is what I enjoy doing and what I have been able to do all throughout my career.

Those two things always stick out in my head as to why it didn’t go well.”Being a frustrated onlooker, Murray recalls that day: “I didn’t get in the squad that day.“Mixu didn’t pick me, unlucky for him!“That was the day Conrad Logan was immense in goal for Hibs. We were actually the better side that day, which was maybe surprising considering how our season had gone.“It was an exciting game and we had chances but couldn’t beat Logan in goal.“It was strange because we just couldn’t win in the league but in the cup it was like the pressure lted.“At that time the fans weren’t happy with the owners and, to be fair, it affected us players.“Confidence was shot around the whole club and it was a mess at that time.“But in the cup that didn’t matter, it was an escape for us.“We ended up falling short, losing on penalties, which was disappointing. To be so close to a major cup final is tough.”Things, of course, didn’t end well that season but fast forward five years and there has been a transformation at Tannadice.United bounced back up from the Championship and secured safety in the Premiership with games to spare.With new owners and a dferent set-up, much has changed since Murray left United for Hibs in .The striker scored  goals in  appearances in tangerine as well as  in  outings in the green of Hibernian.And Murray will be a keen spectator when two of his former sides go head to head for a place in the final, though he admits he’s finding it dficult to pick a winner.“It’s two big clubs going head to head in a cup tie, a one-off  minutes, anything could happen,” the Queen#s Park frontman added.“It’s a really hard game to call.“United’s form lately has been very good, even though they lost to Ross County last weekend.“Hibs# has been similar too and both set of players will be feeling confident over how their season has gone.“United just missed out on the top six and to have a great cup run, Micky Mellon has done really well.“He’s had a limited budget and only really brought in a couple of players. He’s done a great job.“They’ve had some cracking wins this season and it will be interesting to see what they do at Tannadice this summer.“Now, though, United have a massive chance to win the Scottish

Aberdeen-based Gosia Gagalska proves that wreaths can add a pop of colour to your cosy abode all year round.Encouraged by the positive feedback received by her friends and family, Gosia set up her business Oh Wreath when the UK went into lockdown last March.She said: #I used to only decorate my front door for Christmas, but I always loved the idea of how Americans decorate their front doors and houses depending on the season.#I would love to see more colourful decorations in Aberdeen.#Looking at social media, I see that all year round wreaths are more popular in England than in Scotland and it#s time to change that.#I think that most of us still associate wreaths with Christmas, but wreaths can make beautul decorations not just for the festive season and not just for front doors, but also for our gardens, lounges, kitchens as well as conservatories.#Everyone loves an original wedding, birthday or even housewarming present and in my opinion, a unique wreath would make a great gt.#Gosia is known for creating #perfectly imperfect# modern wreaths.She said: #I like to mix dferent flowers, leaves but also rattan balls, wooden beads and butterflies to create original, interesting designs.#My top seller since last year is still a full lavender wreath. I#ve made a few as birthday presents this year already.# vw, px\"  Gosia decided to use hot glue and wire to make her wreaths #Scottish-weather proof#.She said: #You can keep my wreaths outside on the front door, however, to keep colours vibrant for longer, I would recommend keeping them away from direct sun and rain.“I#m using good quality flowers for my wreaths so they#re very long-lasting decorations.“And they are also suitable for both indoor and outdoor displays.“That#s what I love about wreaths # they#re perfect as both indoor and outdoor decorations,” said Gosia.“I had a few customers who ordered wreaths from me for their front doors but they decided to keep them inside as a decoration for their lounge.” vw, px\"  While she was worried coronavirus may influence her wreath sales negatively, Gosia said she may have benefited from people spending more time in their homes this past year and taking the time to redecorate.She said: “I#m really new on the market so can#t compare this year’s sales to previous years.“But when I launched my business I thought that lockdown restrictions may affect orders but at the same time, we all had more time to spend on redecorating our homes.“For me, the last year was all about researching the market and observing home décor trends – I’m happy with how my business grows at the moment.”And Gosia is also delighted she already has a few loyal customers despite Oh Wreath being a relatively new business.She said: #I have a few customers who ordered Christmas wreaths from me and new spring ones are now hanging on their doors.# vw, px\"  Gosia, who is a full-time mum but also works as a weekend assistant manager, said that Oh Wreath is her #third job# and it#s also her creative outlet.She said: #The thing I love the most about my job is how creative it is and I also like that every day will provide a new learning opportunity.“If you run your own business, you#re six people in one body. I#m a photographer, project manager, customer service assistant, social media manager, postwoman and product designer. I#m still trying to improve in each of these fields, so I#m learning a lot.”In the future, Gosia would love to have the opportunity to create extra-large hoops filled with flowers for wedding ceremonies.She added: #I would also love to have a little studio somewhere in Aberdeen.#I#m using a spare room at the moment # I#m trying my husband#s patience in my house.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/c7d6331e-d8d6-47f4-a531-bc70ec093453-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/c7d6331e-d8d6-47f4-a531-bc70ec093453-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/c7d6331e-d8d6-47f4-a531-bc70ec093453-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/c7d6331e-d8d6-47f4-a531-bc70ec093453-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"aberdeenshire wellbeing festival to take place next week","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remThe annual Aberdeenshire Wellbeing Festival is ing next week with a number of exciting online and in-person events taking place for all ages.The festival, now in its sixth year, coincides with National Mental Health Week and will run from Monday to Sunday.It aims to recognise the importance of community activity in promoting wellbeing and reconnect and support personal mental wellbeing.A number of organisations, community groups, public services and iniduals will be working in partnership to put together the programme of activities.Partners include Live Le Aberdeenshire, Aberdeenshire Council, Community Mental Health , Public Health , and the third sector including SAMH and Pillar Kincardine.Inidual contributors include Grandma Griggly.Walks, drawing workshops, talks, gardening and yoga classes, outdoor entertainment and more will be taking place during the seven-day-long event.Calvin Little, public health co-ordinator – Central Aberdeenshire, says the partnership effort is #immense# with services recognising their role in promoting mental wellbeing.#This is the sixth year of the Aberdeenshire Wellbeing Festival, the first took place in May  in support of National Mental Health Week,# Mr Little added.#It was initially established to engage a wider audience, beyond service providers, in promoting mental health.#The festival takes a whole population approach to promoting good mental wellbeing, preventing mental illness, reducing stigma and supporting recovery.

many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses. The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"julie-forrest-borders-bowler-wins-world-championships-title","story":"BORDERS bowler Julie Forrest has won a world championship title with her mixed pairs partner Stewart Anderson.Competing in the World Indoor Bowls Championships, Forrest and Anderson won the final todayagainst Carla Banks and reigning open singles champion Robert Paxton.Forrest, from Hawick, and compatriot Anderson secured a -

I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more. Thatrsquos what I will do.Jesse Rae Jesse Rae, independent candidateThose that know me, are probably a the kids and pupils of Hawick High School , Berwickshire High School, Duns Primary, Langlee Primary, and Philiphaugh Primary ndash all of which I gave ye yer own Radio and TV Station in  and .

He was educated in Edinburgh before studying for his honours degree in Economics at University of Aberdeen, before embarking on a -year career as a professional economist. In , Paul graduated with a Masters in Business Administrationfrom University of Edinburgh.

In the last five years alone, Paul and his team have helped or supported more than , constituents from his office in Hawick. Paul is an experienced parliamentarian and minister, having led seven Acts through Parliament ndash most recently legislating on Heat networks. Indeed, after serving for a year on the Parliamentrsquos Finance Committee and Standards Committee, Paul was appointed within the Scottish Government in , as Minister for Environment and Climate Change, in which role he served until November . In Nicola Sturgeonrsquos first ministerial team following her appointment, Paul was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs and, following, the  election, became Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country. Please vote like our future depends on it. Vote Scottish Greens.Michael Banks Michael Banks is a retired barrister and Vanguard Partys candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale  Lauderdale, and heads the partys list for South Scotland. He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication. It will oppose any denial of biological truth.Vanguard Party will champion children of disadvantaged backgrounds by providing help and support to raise attainment.

It will tackle hospital waiting lists and support GPs to resume face-to-face appointments for all.Vanguard Party will abolish hate crime including incitement of hatred in peoples minds. It will require crimes to be based on evidence, tested objectively, not on subjective perceptions of victims or others.Vanguard Party will champion traditional values and culture.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

from the Union.But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the Scottish First Ministerrsquos failure to recapture the dizzy heights of , when her predecessor and now rival Alex Salmond won a healthy -seat majority in Edinburgh, indicated there was not a fervour among the public for another independence poll.Mr Gove instead urged the SNP leader to ldquoconcentrate on recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, following the Prime Ministerrsquos invitation for her and other devolved leaders to contribute to economic revival plans.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show that ldquoa majority of people who voted in the constituencies voted for parties that were opposed to a referendum and Ms Sturgeon ldquodidnrsquot secure a majority as Alex Salmond did in Prime.ldquoThat is a signicant dference, Mr Gove said.ldquoAlex Salmond, when he requested a referendum, every party in the Scottish Parliament agreed that it was appropriate to have a referendum given that he had secured a majority.vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoIt is not the case now ndash as we see ndash that the people of Scotland are agitating for a referendum.Ms Sturgeon said the UK Government was showing a ldquolack of respect for Scottish democracy in threatening to stand in the way of a follow-up to rsquos rejected independence vote.She told Marr: ldquoIn this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manesto commitment to firstlyhellip continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic.ldquoBut after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum.ldquoThe fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK Government has demonstrated for quite some time now.The row comes after the Prime Minister invited Ms Sturgeon for crisis talks on the Union, calling for proposals from devolved leaders on how to recover from the pandemic.In his invitation letter to Ms Sturgeon, which she has accepted following her re-election as First Minister, Boris Johnson argued the UK was ldquobest served when we work together.He added: ldquoWe will all have our own perspectives and ideas ndash and we will not always agree ndash but I am confident that by learning from each other we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve.Mr Gove looked to skirt suggestions that Westminster ministers could intervene via the Supreme Court to block legislation from the Scottish Parliament that attempts to engineer a second independence referendum, saying: ldquoWersquore not going near there.Ms Sturgeon, who said she ldquowouldnrsquot rule out putting legislation for a referendum before MSPs early next year, claimed a battle in the courts would be ldquoabsurd and completely outrageous.Elsewhere, the Labour fallout over its poor showing in

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable.

Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

Here are just a few:Our gardens take up such a lot of habitat, and by each making our own plot more hedgehog-friendly, we can improve a huge amount of habitat for them.If you don#t have a garden yourself, you can still help by contacting public space managers, neighbours, family and friends to ensure they are all doing their bit.We urge everyone to become a #hedgehog champion# for their area at Hedgehog Street – a project run by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and our partners, People#s Trust for Endangered Species.Join more than , #champions# by signing up, free, at: www.hedgehogstreet.org – you will get an email with top tips on how you can help hedgehogs each month and there#s even a Hedgehog Street app you can download from the App Store or Google Play.Despite lockdown restrictions easing, many parents of neonatal babies in Scotland continue to face challenges in being with their premature or sick baby.In the past year, parental access at many units has been restricted, with parents often unable to attend together and some limits on theof time they can stay.As part of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month this May, Bliss is raising awareness of the devastating impact of these restrictions.In a Bliss survey of over  UK parents of neonatal babies born in the past  months, who are already at a high risk of experiencing mental health dficulties,  per cent said they felt isolated and  per cent said their mental health has become worse.Bliss is calling on the NHS to introduce a national roadmap for ato usual   parent access on neonatal units as a matter of urgency, and to work with NHS Trusts in Scotland and beyond to implement it consistently across the country."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup.

resident said: ldquoThere were very few Musselburgh records in Register House, and they were supposed to have been lost, but a few years ago they were discovered in a locked room in the town hall in

ldquoThat was the stock punishment for witchcraft. People run away with the idea that witches in Scotland were burnt alive but that is nonsense.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12582710.jpg?type=article-full","title":"skye-kate-spiers-islands-charms","story":"Where is it Skye.Why do you go there Ive only ever been there for work and once with a friend for a quick overnight trip, but from my first visit I fell in love.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic. So highly tuned are the animalrsquos senses that managing to get close enough to take nice pictures without it having any sense of being watched, gives you an adrenaline rush. Therersquos no doubt that my clients and I get high on it. Then you crave your next fix.The Secret Le of the Otter is not intended as a scientic text but a ldquocelebration of the species. Howardrsquos first book may well have been influential in bringing about a parliamentary ban on the mass culling of mountain hares and he hopes this one will have a similar legacy in terms of awareness-raising, so that people will ldquofall in love with the animals ndash thereby helping to ensure they are respected and protected.Of all the beautul images in his book, Howardrsquos favourite features a pair of white-tailed eagles, swooping down on an otter that had just landed its catch. ldquoTo get one eagle with an otter is fairly unusual to get two is pretty special.Inevitably for the photographer, as for the fish-hungry otter, there is always the one that got away. He dearly wanted to include an image of an otter eating a lobster and one evening, he watched through binoculars as one surfaced,  metres offshore, with a pair of distinctive red antennae hanging from its mouth.Howard made for the otterrsquos most likely landing ground and switched on his camera, only to find that the battery was dead. ldquoSo I had to sit and watch that otter eat that lobster ndash one of my dream images. It was lovely to watch but I could have almost cried.ldquoWhether it will happen again for me I donrsquot know. Crsquoest la vie, though. You canrsquot stress out or get angryyou miss a shot. You just have to hope itrsquoll come round again or something similar will come along.ldquoAnd inevitably, it does, he says, demonstrating his carefully honed otter karma.The Secret Le of the Otter by Andy Howard is published by Sandstone Press, pound.FAMOUS OTTER STORIESCuthbert and the OttersOtters are referred to as ldquowater dogs in Celtic folklore, and generally portrayed as helpful, friendly creatures, providing fish or firewood to people in need and even warming their feet, as in the story of St Cuthbert ndash patron saint of otters. A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt.

Many have. If the best guesses of the historians and archaeologists are correct the Ring Of Brodgar was constructed between BC and BC, though it has never been properly excavated so an exact date is hard to pin down. Nor is the signicance it held for the Neolithic people of the islands properly understood. Clearly it had some sort of ceremonial , but it may also have been used for some kind of planetary observation. Or perhaps all that recommended it was the natural beauty of the site, which sits on an isthmus, the Ness of Brodgar, separating the Loch of Stenness and the Loch of Harray. Along with the mystery and power of the place itrsquos the setting which strikes the visitor most forcefully today.What isnrsquot in doubt is that the Ring of Brodgar ranks alongside the English sites of Stonehenge and Avebury as the finest extant examples of stone circles in Britain ndash though Brodgar is the only one of the three which is an almost perfect circle.

I stopped at a shop in Pirnmill and told the shop assistant: \"It is  years since I last was here.rsquorsquo She took the news calmly.I, in contrast, spent much of the trip catching flimsy, colourful fibres that swirled into the recesses of my napper on the capricious winds of times past.The summer of  may just be remembered universally for more than the MacDonald family holiday in Pirnmill, however dficult that is to believe.But on myto Arran as an old man, I found my memories were oddly vivid and that the signicance of that particular holiday in the sixties has endured. HUGH: Nuisance calls drive me madThere are the obvious facets. It was the first holiday that I realised we had a bit of money. Not oodles. But a bit.Pater had moved some years before, resisting the allure of being an electrician in Dalmarnock sewage works to being an early and unrecognised source for Mad Men. This owed something to his undoubted eccentricity, but is mostly attributable to his rising success as an advertising executive.We stayed in Pirnmill for most of the school holidays, with dad travelling down on weekends. With the instinct of a clan unused to money, we knew this cost money.It was also the last time the family spent a holiday together. It seems odd but we were heading off in dferent directions even then. With a spell at seminary and then a career in journalism, I never really lived at home again and never joined the rest on holiday, at least en masse.My reminiscence also recovered something slightly odd but utterly irrefutable. The boy of  was not much dferent from the dodderer of . In Pirnmill of , I was plagued by puberty, racked by doubt, immersed in self-talk, and thrummed to a gentle, constant pulse of anxiety. At , it was largely the same, including the battle with puberty.There was, though, an acceptance of these traits that did not quite exist in the past. HUGH: Kelvingrove memoriesThere was, too, a recognition that what consumed me then, sustains me now.Arran then was constantly sunny, or so it seemed. The MacDonald clan revelled in swimming, walking, cycling and fishing. It was like an Enid Blyton novel without the odd events at Smugglersrsquo Cove and stripped of lashings of ginger beer and English exceptionalism.At its core for me were the transistor radio and the book. The small radio was stashed under a pillow and was a faithful companion late into the night and early into the morning. It crackled, misfired and occasionally caught a radio station across the spectrum. My love of music and radio was kindled in these sessions. It lives on, allowing me to drt through restless nights.It was the arrival of the books, though, that fully stirred communal emotion. The MacDonald family consumed books the way the Kardashians use up spouses.A new supplywas delivered by my father each week. We fell on them with the energy of wolves after a six-week fast. We then passed them around in a sort of literary game of speed dating.It was the way I was introduced to F Scott Fitzgerald. The Great Gatsby, presumably brought for mum, was guided into my hands. It was read then. It is read now.I am not a committed re-reader. I believe there are too many great books still to be read and so shirk from revisiting a past delight.:Rosemary Goring: Its not just the squirrels who are coming out of hibernation, we are tooThere are exceptions. Gatsby is one. It is rewarding and infuriating. It offers constant gts on every visit. It retains its intrigue. Most of all, it reminds me of why I read.Of course, there is the pleasure of being immersed in good prose, there is the delight of a visit to another place, there is the comfort of being lost in another world.I realise now that it also takes me back to the boy. It shows me that many things change in the world but beliefs, passions and pleasures can survive the depredations of time. Of course, they are refined or adapted to present circumstances but what carried me then somehow bears me now.This owes something to the physical aspect of a book but more to its spiritual power. It can remind us of a family that has suffered but routine, natural but grievous loss but carries cascades of love that accompany that bond and need no physical proximity to survive.It is why snatches of prose, snippets of music or even a visit to the wee shop at Pirnmill have such power. They remind us of who we each were but also reveal who we are now. Certainly, there has been change. But beneath the bruises and the scars inflicted by time and wilful self, this soul can look back at the child and say: ldquoI recognise you.In the routine excitement a ferry trip prompts in me, I may glimpse him today. I live in the present but occasionally heed the call of the past. It is, after all, very F Scott.The ferry finds me today living his famous last line of Gatsby.rsquorsquoSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.I will not resist.

Their goal was to create a clean water supply for a population which had endured successive cholera outbreaks, the water-borne virus costing thousands of lives.However, the creation of Mugdock reservoir, which was opened by Queen Victoria in  and appeared on postcards at the time, had other health benefits for urban dwellers.The Victorian public park movement, which started in the s, sprung, out of a desire to improve health in the rapidly growing industrial cities.The upper classes had long enjoyed green spaces, even in cities.

They were in easy reach by rail and road for those wishing to escape the dense urban environment of the city. Today, they attract around , visitors a year and numbers spiked when lockdown restrictions were lted.\"It appeared on postcards so people got to know about it and public transport was always good,\" said Mr Salwand. \"People went out of curiosity, it was the northern part of the city, you could see the Campsies and the Kilpatrick hills.\"A lot of effort went into the landscape.

And how. The winning Tory candidate in Thursday nightrsquos by-election gained twice as many votes as the sitting Labour MP.To portray Hartlepool as belonging to Labourrsquos heartlands doesnrsquot really tell the story: this town is at the heart of the heartlands. It takes some amount of neglect and entitlement to lose it to the Tories by such a margin.If the swing from red to blue were to be repeated in the  UK election, another  Labour seats, once considered to be their natural terrain, would also fall to the Tories. The Labour Party, north and south of the border, can now be considered destitute: last orders have been called and they have no home to call their own.When I visited this town in  after it had voted - in favour of Brexit scores of Labour voters told me the same story: they had waited in vain for more than two decades for someone, anyone, to heed their cries for help.: What will SNP win mean for working class In  Hartlepool was listed in the top % of Englandrsquos most deprived areas in a survey that measured income, health, education and crime. They were resentful at being labelled racist by the elites in their own party for daring to back Brexit.If Labour strategists had cared enough to listen theyrsquod know why. After tens of thousands of jobs disappeared in fishing and car manufacturing, there was no industrial strategy to help this area recover. The same story was unfolding up and down the Humber Estuary: a wholesale surrender to Europe on fishing rights was followed by an influx of cheap foreign labour undercutting local wage agreements. These stemmed from EU pay regulations which encouraged exploitation of eastern European workers. To oppose this doesnrsquot make you racist.Jeremy Corbyn understood why, though, and this underpinned his long-held disdain for the EU corporate club. On Friday morning, as the full extent of Labourrsquos Hartlepool capitulation became apparent, several of Sir Keirrsquos company men were wheeled out to hang it on his predecessor.Anas SarwarldquoWhat chance did we have, they whined, citing Labourrsquos collapse in , but this was a lame excuse. In these local elections Boris Johnson has surfed the waves of euphoria flowing from the successful vaccination roll-out and the end of lockdown. In , working-class communities, swept up by Brexit and resentful of the Labourrsquos elitesrsquo EU obsession began to rebel. Hartlepool confirmed that Labourrsquos Red Wall is now rubble.In Scotland, the collapse of UK Labour is a watershed moment for the partyrsquos leader, Anas Sarwar. In England, the process of surrendering Labour fortresses to the Tories was begun by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. As they were mesmerised by neo-liberalism and corporatism they came to regard communities like Hartlepool and Bolsover as their politically-incorrect uncle Harry: we canrsquot disown them but do we really have to talk to them.Toryism of the most insidious stamp is now embedded in every corner of England and Labour have made gts of their former territories. The Labour elites who betrayed Corbyn no longer speak the same language as the working-class communities they once purported to represent. Itrsquos a language the Tories have now learned.: Theof Project FearEngland is now entirely under the control of an Etonian kleptocracy who have commandeered patriotism, royalty and gunboats to hoodwink working-class communities that they share their values. These poor people, owing to Labourrsquos neglect of them, will learn the harsh truth when the decade of austerity begins and they find themselves once more on the receiving end.Never has England seemed so distant in its culture, instincts and values. That a dissolute and feckless aristocrat, distrusted by his own party, and for whom poundk-a-year and free accommodation is not enough can triumph in Hartlepool tells its own story.Mr Sarwar now has a choice to make which will define his leadership. Does he continue to pledge allegiance to a polity now under the eternal dominion of this class  If he chooses to maintain his glib sufferance of such a state then he will make Labour an utter irrelevance in Scotland. If he chooses to lend his weight to a second independence referendum he brings his party back into the game with a chance of forming the first government of an independent Scotland.English Labourrsquos failure to heed the messages coming from their former strongholds mirrors the experience of the party in Scotland. They had a sense of entitlement that their fortresses in Glasgow, Dundee, Inverclyde and North Lanarkshire would always come through. As their grandees were seduced by the leather and lace of the Westminster bordello they simply abandoned these communities. Rather than stay and fight for them Jack McConnell, George Foulkes, George Robertson and Alistair Darling chose ermine robes and the Palace of Westminsterrsquos comforting teat.Mr Sarwar doesnrsquot need me to tell him that many of his partyrsquos former supporters voted for the SNP on Thursday against all the instincts and traditions of their families. Nicola Sturgeon has expertly deployed a hard Brexit and the gangsterism of Downing Street to keep them. Her promises of seeking a second referendum are now like confetti and last about as long. Scotlandrsquos First Minister merely has to represent something dferent from the corrupt regime that Mr Sarwarrsquos ill-judged Unionism reinforces she doesnrsquot actually have to make dferent happen.If Mr Sarwar maintains his unflinching support for a state destined to be controlled by the hard right for a generation then Labour is finished up here too. In this hersquoll betray those working-class communities who have been locked out of the Holyrood vanity project and its platinum-card lounges since the beginning of devolution.He talks about a Covid recovery parliament, but Hartlepool means that this concept is already out-dated.

Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

That does not equate to a confident public. Quite the contrary. Voters might feel inclined to keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse. They might, at the very least, prefer to delay the decision.Finally, from the political to the personal. Nicola Sturgeon must be simply exhausted. A bizarre yet enervating election on top of endless endeavours to counter coronavirus and sustain the economy.All that plus Alex Salmond, seemingly at her shoulder for months, leading up to his unwanted offer of Holyrood help in pursuit of independence.For Nicola Sturgeon, then, time for rest and recuperation.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"mike-settle-sir-keir-starmer-now-faces-major-rethink-reset","story":"By contrast, Boris Johnson on his victory visit to Hartlepool was in high spirits, joking as he met a ft inflatable version of himself and, like fellow national incumbents Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland and Mark Drakeford in Wales, enjoying the electoral afterglow of a vaccine bounce.Declaring what mattered was delivery on the ground, the Prime Minister insisted he had dedicated his government to the ldquomassive project of ldquouniting and levelling up the country.ldquoNumber one is continuing the vaccine rollout, declared Mr Johnson, ldquomaking sure we go from jab to jab, to jab to jobs, jobs, jobs.Despite all the political bruises he has suffered in the past weeks, and will doubtless suffer again in the coming ones, voters south of the border sought, for now, to support the Conservativesrsquo positive message of jabs and jobs.Amid the blight of the pandemic, it was a triumph of hope over despair and not only resulted in the Toriesrsquo astonishing win in Hartlepool, which elected its first Conservative MP for  years, but a landslide victory for their candidate Ben Houchen, who was ed as mayor for Tees Valley, yet another former Labour heartland.While there were a few red shoots in England, the overall theme was one of Tory gains and consolidation from Essex to Northumberland.As the Labour losses piled up it did not take long for the recriminations to set in.Not surprisingly, Jeremy Corbyn led the charge, suggesting his successor had been ldquooffering nothing only insipid support to the Tory Government while John McDonnell, the former Shadow Chancellor, accused his party leader of sending candidates into battle ldquoalmost naked without a full policy programme.:Angela Rayner sacked as Labour party chairmanThe union barons also piled into Sir Keir with alacrity. Unitersquos Len McCluskey complained: ldquoPeople donrsquot know what his vision is. People donrsquot know what Labour stand for anymore.Meanwhile from the partyrsquos centre, the wily Sultan of Spin popped up to insist the defeat in his former manor of Hartlepool was down to the long shadows of Covid and Corbyn.Lord Mandelson, who admitted to ldquomild fury at the by-election defeat, declared: ldquoWe have not won a general election in  years, and pointedly noted: ldquoWe have lost the last four with  a catastrophe. The last  general elections read: lose, lose, lose, lose, Blair, Blair, Blair, lose, lose, lose, lose.Brexit doubtless had an effect, particularly in Hartlepool, where more than % of voters had opted for Leave. It is clear the tranche of voters, who Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party won over, chose to support the Tories rather than Labour.But Brexit was not the only reason for the Conservativesrsquo wins. Time and again as the electoral dust settled, voters in northern England insisted they had for years been taken for granted by Labour. Sound familiar Northerners insisted Labour politicians had not listened to their concerns while the Tories went beyond the old Left-Right ide and put community investment at the forefront of their campaign.The real fear for Sir Keir and his strategists in Labour HQ must be that what happened to the party in Scotland over two decades is now happening in northern England. Those areas, once described as heartlands from the industrial past, have lost heart with Labour.:Anas Sarwar: Labour to form credible alternative to SNPOne Opposition frontbencher admitted the by-election result had sparked ldquofull-on panic among Labour MPs, fearful their seats could be at risk at the next general election.Wales was a dferent story. Mr Drakeford defied the pollsters and led Welsh Labour to gain  seats, equalling its best ever result, and ensuring its -year unbroken run in power will continue. The dferent outcome for Labour in Wales simply underlined how this has become a disunited kingdom with voters across three nations taking dferent approaches to the choices before them.Of course, Conservative consolidation south of the border will only play into the Nationalist narrative north of it that Scotland and England are increasingly drting apart politically and there is only one solution to resolve this.It is intriguing how, in England at least, while Labour has increasingly become a metropolitan party, attractive to Remainer students and well-to-do English middle classes but lost touch with northern England working class communities, the Tories have begun to appeal to poorer ldquoRed Wall towns, many of which backed Brexit.Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, a Shadow Defence Minister but perhaps not for long, derided the ldquoLondon-based bourgeoisie, backed by ldquobrigades of woke social media warriors, that had ldquoeffectively captured the party. Sir Keir, London-born and Surrey-raised, is MP for Holborn and St Pancras.Centre Right Labour peer Lord Adonis branded him a ldquotransitional figure and claimed: ldquoLabourrsquos problem is it has had weak or terrible leaders since Tony Blair stood down  years ago and until it gets an electable leader, it will keep losing elections.The name of northerner Andy Burnham, the Manchester mayor, is already being whispered as a future leader.Sir Keir now faces a major rethink and reset, that will involve a frontline reshuffle, an overhaul of policy and a drive to reunite hisparty.Labour needs fundamentally to find and set out a clear, bold mission statement for Britain in the st century. We could see some familiar faces, big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn,to the frontbench.The mountain Labour has to climb to win power in, perhaps, just two yearsrsquo time, is of Everest proportions so much so that a pre-election pact with the Liberal Democrats looks increasingly possible as the only means to stop a fourth consecutive Tory term. Last month, Ed Davey referred to the pressing need for a ldquoprogressive anti-Tory alternative.As Sir Keir and his colleagues now struggle through Labourrsquos dark night of the soul, they can only hope these elections are the darkest period before the new dawn.

Again, the signs pointed to tactical voting by supporters of the Union.Ms Harper had caused controversy during the election campaign by claiming a border between Scotland and England resulting from independence could ldquocreate jobs.Mr Carson told the BBC he was \"absolutely delighted\" by the result, adding: \"Our hard work over the last few months has paid off, and Im honoured and privileged to be serving the people of Galloway and West Dumfries once again up in Holyrood.\"Elsewhere, the SNP held on to its most marginal seat, Perthshire South and Kinross-shire.This had been a key target for the Scottish Conservatives, who had hoped to take it from the Nationalists.The result will have come as a relief to Jim Fairlie, the SNP candidate, who was standing in the seat after the partys Roseanna Cunningham decided to step down.He previously told The Herald he was \"very, very wary of taking anything for granted\".Laughing, he had added: \"But you know, in all honesty, I dont want to be the guy that loses the seat after Roseanna Cunningham has held it for, including her Westminster career,  years.\"After the strangest and potentially most important election in the history of devolution, the SNP won two seats from the Tories and one from Labour, making it the only party to make constituency gains.The final result put it on  seats, the Conservatives , Labour , the Scottish Greens eight and Liberal Democrats four.The SNP took East Lothian from Labour and Ayr and Edinburgh Central from the Tories, with the latter previously held by Ruth Davidson, who is now off to the House of Lords.But one of the most dramatic results of the election came on Friday evening after an incredibly tense count in Dumbarton.Previously Scotlands most marginal constituency, it was one of the SNPs top targets, but Labours Jackie Baillie managed to increase her tiny majority of  in  to ,.Such was the elation within Labour, one party source compared it to a World Cup win.Elsewhere, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross willto Holyrood on the Highlands and Islands regional list as his party upped its number of MSPs in the area.He was previously an MSP from  to , and is currently the MP for Moray.Speaking after his election, Mr Ross said: \"This region is so important to me - I have lived within the Highlands and Islands in Moray my entire le.\"I have had the great pleasure and privilege to represent this this area before and Im delighted to be ed again to represent this erse and wonderful part of Scotland.\"Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar retained his seat on the Glasgow regional list as his party held four seats in the area.He had challenged Ms Sturgeon in her Glasgow Southside constituency but failed to make a dent in her majority.Meanwhile, Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie ed to Holyrood with his party having secured a record number of MSPs, including Lorna Slater, its other leader, representing Lothian.The SNP won all nine constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region, with winners including Kaukab Stewart, Scotlands first female ethnic minorty MSP, who won in Glasgow Kelvin.Other winners included Ivan McKee, Scotlands trade minister, James Dornan and John Mason.Eight Glasgow constituencies were declared at the citys Emirates Arena, with the count for Rutherglen taking place in South Lanarkshire.The SNP also won a clean sweep of the remaining Edinburgh constituencies yesterday.After all votes were counted in the capital, the SNP had four seats, including Edinburgh Central, while Scottish Labour and the Liberal Democrats each held their seats, with every incumbent increasing their majority.Speaking after her re-election as MSP for Edinburgh Eastern, the SNPs Ash Denham said \"Westminster must listen\" after a pro-independence majority looked set toto Holyrood.Ms Denham, who served as the community safety minister in the last Scottish Government, held her seat and increased her majority to more than ,.Scottish Labours Daniel Johnson held Edinburgh Southern and Liberal Democrat Alex Cole-Hamilton retained the Edinburgh Western seat with , votes -

But it is only now, as wersquove seen it happen, that the potential crisis has become actual.The UK Government insists there is no case for another referendum on independence because we had one in . Boris Johnson has even suggested that the gap for Indyref should be the same as between the first and second referendums on Europe:  years. But this has been a holding position and is no longer sustainable. Ciaran Martin, the former UK Cabinet Office civil servant who oversaw the  referendum, says this rejectionism is an offence against democracy itself. If the independence parties win another majority, he said last month, ldquothere is no legitimate justication on which to resist a referendum.:Johnson invites Sturgeon to Team UK four nations summit after election victoryIt is true there were other issues in this election campaign besides the referendum: education and the pandemic for starters. But no-one in Scotland could have been in any doubt about what they were voting for on Thursday. When they placed their crosses on the SNP and the Greens, they were voting emphatically for Indyref. Scottish voters must themselves now take responsibility for their actions. The very size of the turnout has upped the constitutional ante.The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, claimed that Nicola Sturgeon was planning an illegal ldquowildcat referendum. That is untrue. She has always said that the only referendum she would agree to is a constitutional, legally-binding one authorised by Westminster under a Section  Order. This is for a very good reason. Only such a referendum would be regarded as legitimate by other countries ndash especially the European Union, which the SNP is eager to rejoin. Only a legally-binding referendum would put the result, as she put it, ldquobeyond doubt or challenge in the eyes of the world.Which doesnrsquot mean she will simply accept the Westminster veto. Ms Sturgeon made clear in the Channel  leadersrsquo debate that she intends to go to court herself. She will ask the Scottish Parliament to pass a referendum bill and then defy Boris Johnson to reject it. Assuming he does, the Scottish Government will then challenge this ruling in the courts. Irsquom not entirely sure this will succeed, and Irsquom not entirely sure she thinks it will either. The Supreme Court would ultimately rule on the matter, and it seems unlikely that the United Kingdomrsquos highest court would actively support the dissolution of the United Kingdom.But that isnrsquot really the point. Court action would be constitutional theatre designed to increase the moral pressure on Boris Johnson to offer a plausible referendum timetable. There was speculation last month that he might actually do this. Ministers had, it was reported, considered holding a snap referendum to catch the SNP unawares.Support for the SNP may remain stratospheric, but support for independence has been waning somewhat. Nicola Sturgeon has had dficulty explaining the new border and currency issues that arise with independence post-Brexit. So why not put the question now, while the SNP is on the back foot I donrsquot think therersquos much risk of this happening. Boris Johnson may have won the Brexit vote, but he is very wary indeed of referendums. He saw what happened to his predecessor, David Cameron, who thought the  referendum would be a walk-over for Remain. The  referendum was a near-death experience for the British state. Referendums are highly unpredictable, and rarely just about the narrow question on the ballot paper.Indeed, a second Scottish independence referendum could easily turn into a referendum on Boris Johnson himself ndash a figure who is profoundly unpopular in Scotland. The Scottish Conservatives barred him from appearing in the election campaign, even though the PM had said that ldquowild horses couldnrsquot keep him away.:Iain Macwhirter: It was an SNP landslide, but dont expect an early IndyrefWe have heard much about the Governmentrsquos plans for massive investment in Scotland on roads and rail links, even a bridge or tunnel to Northern Ireland. But such pork-barrel initiatives are unlikely to answer the fundamental question. If the UK Government is to repeatedly reject the clearly expressed will of the Scottish people to hold a referendum, how can it reasonably claim to be a democracy  Continuing to reject it would transform the Union from being a partnership of nations into a coercive union, based on legal force.Piecemeal reform, such as the Smith Commission in  that tinkered with tax powers, and gave a mendacious assurance that the Sewel Convention was inviolable, will not do. There has to be a recognition in Westminster that Scotland is now in charge of its own destiny. I believe there are ways to achieve this and retain the only union worth saving: one that is a free and equal partnership of nations.The devolution era is over. Power devolved is power retained, and events since Brexit have confirmed the wisdom of that dictum. The federal boat, however, has also sailed. England would never agree to the upheaval involved in creating the constitutional paraphernalia of federalism: regional parliaments, a federal executive, a president of the UK. They are quite happy with the Parliament theyrsquove got. What might be possible is a form of asymmetrical federalism that the late Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, used to call ldquoindependence in the UK and the SNP called ldquofiscal autonomy.All tax and spending powers could be devolved to Scotland, with Holyrood sending back a percept, a kind of fee, for common services like defence and currency. This would end the Barnett Formula and give full economic responsibility to Holyrood, but retain the social and cultural links with the rest of the UK. It would largely fulfil what was envisaged by the SNPrsquos  Independence White Paper: a ldquonew UK with a common currency, borderless trade with England, and the retention of UK institutions like the Crown and BBC.This would be a radical departure, however, not dissimilar to the way countries like New Zealand and Canada acquired quasi-independence in the s in the sterling area. The evidence is pretty clear that England, which following Hartlepool is becoming more Tory and more nationalist, would not object. It would mean Scotland taking charge of the money issue and ending what has been called Scotlandrsquos ldquodependency culture.For their part, Scottish nationalists are beginning to realise that independence is no walk in the park now that Britain is out of the EU. No-one wants a hard border with England, but one is now inevitable.Independence in the UK would create a new Union held together not by legal constraint, but by consent. I have no idea whether Boris Johnson has the will or the imagination to seize this opportunity. I rather doubt it. But even he must realise that doing nothing is no longer an option. As the prince said in The Leopard, ldquoeverything must change in order to remain the same."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-sale-public-land-sold-luxury-developers","story":"Several communities told The Ferret they were misled or ignored by housebuilders and public bodies on development plans.Developers also allegedly breached planning rules without consequence, while councils scrapped local plans ndash including a healthcare hub for the elderly ndash to allow for new developments, sometimes on greenbelt land.Nearly pound million of land was bought from Scotlandrsquos councils, universities and NHS boards by CALA homes between  and , according to data obtained by The Ferret through freedom of information law. This amounts to  per cent of the poundm of public land sold in recent years.Areas where hospitals, schools, nurseries, clinics, community centres and libraries once sat were bought up by private firms such as CALA, Robertson, Westpoint, and Expresso.While land has been used for mid-market and affordable houses, luxury homes and penthouse complexes worth up to poundm have also been built on sites which once were publicly owned.Housing charities warned that the need for affordable homes ldquohas never been greater, while campaigners said The Ferretrsquos investigation highlighted how ldquoingrained the privatisation agenda remains.New wave of developmentsThe Ferretrsquos ongoing Selling Off Scotland investigation found that developers were behind nearly all the largest recent public land transactions, many of which led to luxury developments in and around Edinburgh and Glasgow, most commonly built by CALA.The biggest public land sale saw CALA buy the University of Strathclydersquos Jordanhill Campus in Glasgow for nearly poundm in . It built  luxury homes ranging from pound, to pound,.The development sparked a row with local parents, who accused nearby Jordanhill School of striking a ldquocash-for-places deal with CALA, as reported by The Herald. The school reportedly changed its admissions policy to include the new addresses in exchange for a pound.m gym built by CALA.The Jordanhill Families For Inclusion group told The Ferret that parents on the schoolrsquos board later voted out the deal. In another large public land transaction, the former Middlefield special needs school site in Glasgow was sold to Westpoint Homes for pound.m in . The developer used the land, which sits within the Glasgow West Conservation Area, to build  luxury apartments, penthouses and duplexes, with prices ranging from pound, to pound,.In , Glasgow City Council sold land at Park Quadrant next to Kelvingrove Park to property firm Expresso for pound.m. The resulting luxury development received hundreds of objections from locals who wanted to keep the green space.The Park and Woodlands Heritage Group argued locals were not consulted and that its own proposal for public gardens was scuppered by the council. The council said its application ldquowas invalid for a number of reasonsrsquorsquo and claimed the group had not addressed the proposalrsquos issues.Engineers behind Expressorsquos plans were later investigated for allegedly misleading the councilrsquos planning committee with fake letters of support. The Association for Consultancy and Engineering, which investigated Woolgar Hunter and Atelier Ten, said it does not ldquoshare the outcomes of disciplinary investigations publicly. The Ferret contacted both engineering firms but did not receive a response.CALA also bought public land at Bearsden and Newton Mearns in East Dunbartonshire and part of the old Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, for a collective pound.m. All sites are now luxury homes and apartment complexes.Public interest lsquoignoredrsquoARCHITECT Malcolm Fraser said The Ferretrsquos investigation had revealed ldquoan underlying transfer from the public to the private realm of good, well-located sites and sturdy, well-crafted buildings, to be replaced by shoddy newbuilds.He added: ldquoMeanwhile, the old sites,in leafy areas, are snapped up as glam apartments, sometimes by offshore and Far East absentee investors hellip or,less-leafy, left to moulder until maximum public regeneration funding is screwed out of us.Planning Democracy, a Scottish charity which campaigns for an inclusive planning system, said when public land is sold, it ldquochucks away the community power that goes with it.The consequences ldquoare rarely measured or calculated into the equation, the replenishing of depleted coffers being the main aim of the game, said founder Clare Symonds.Ms Symonds argued that ldquoa public interest test must be passed before land is sold off.Shelter Scotland warned that the need for affordable housing ldquohas never been greater. It is calling for the new Scottish Government to build at least , social homes over the next Parliament. ldquoWe were already dealing with a housing emergency before coronavirus hit, said a spokesperson. ldquoAnd,we donrsquot act, things could get a lot worse.The Ferretrsquos investigation had revealed that ldquoland and public assets are being sold off on a massive scale, said Scottish Labourrsquos housing spokesperson, Pauline McNeill. ldquoWe need to invest in growing our public assets, including building more social homes to deal with our housing crisis.Kim Long of the Scottish Greens argued that large developers were ldquotoo often given free rein on public land, threatening public assets and destroying much-needed green spaces.She said: ldquoWhatrsquos worse, communities are still sidelined in decision-making far too often.But a CALA spokesperson said: ldquoThe development of publicly-owned sites typically involves land that has been determined as no longer required or fit for purpose to the seller, following a strategic review by the relevant Government body.ldquoA robust procurement process follows, to ensure the maximisation of funds to the public body.

secure a majority in the Scottish Parliament elections.The SNP fell one seat short of an overall majority during the Super Thursday elections, securing  seats in Holyrood.However, the final result still means that voters elected a pro-independence majority to the Scottish Parliament, with the Scottish Green Party also standing on a ticket to split from the Union.But Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the Scottish First Ministerrsquos failure to recapture the dizzy heights of , when her predecessor and now rival Alex Salmond won a healthy -seat majority in Edinburgh, indicated there was not a fervour among the public for another independence poll.Mr Gove instead urged the SNP leader to ldquoconcentrate on recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, following the Prime Ministerrsquos invitation for her and other devolved leaders to contribute to economic revival plans.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show that ldquoa majority of people who voted in the constituencies voted for parties that were opposed to a referendum and Ms Sturgeon ldquodidnrsquot secure a majority as Alex Salmond did in Prime.ldquoThat is a signicant dference, Mr Gove said.ldquoAlex Salmond, when he requested a referendum, every party in the Scottish Parliament agreed that it was appropriate to have a referendum given that he had secured a majority. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoIt is not the case now ndash as we see ndash that the people of Scotland are agitating for a referendum.Ms Sturgeon said the UK Government was showing a ldquolack of respect for Scottish democracy in threatening to stand in the way of a follow-up to rsquos rejected independence vote.She told Marr: ldquoIn this election they have voted overwhelmingly for the SNP and we stood on a manesto commitment to firstlyhellip continue to steer the country through the Covid pandemic.ldquoBut after the crisis to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum.ldquoThe fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK Government has demonstrated for quite some time now.The row comes after the Prime Minister invited Ms Sturgeon for crisis talks on the Union, calling for proposals from devolved leaders on how to recover from the pandemic.In his invitation letter to Ms Sturgeon, which she has accepted following her re-election as First Minister, Boris Johnson argued the UK was ldquobest served when we work together.He added: ldquoWe will all have our own perspectives and ideas ndash and we will not always agree ndash but I am confident that by learning from each other we will be able to build back better, in the interests of the people we serve.Mr Gove looked to skirt suggestions that Westminster ministers could intervene via the Supreme Court to block legislation from the Scottish Parliament that attempts to engineer a second independence referendum, saying: ldquoWersquore not going near there.Ms Sturgeon, who said she ldquowouldnrsquot rule out putting legislation for a referendum before MSPs early next year, claimed a battle in the courts would be ldquoabsurd and completely outrageous.Elsewhere, the Labour fallout over its poor showing in the elections has continued as Sir Kier Starmer embarks on a reshuffle of his shadow cabinet. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has sacked his deputy Angela Rayner as chairman of the party Despite the Labour leader facing strong criticism after opting to sack his deputy Angela Rayner from her role as party chairman and national campaign co-ordinator on Saturday ndash with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham

councils and suffering defeat at the hands of Boris Johnsonrsquos Conservatives in the Hartlepool by-election ndash the first time the north-east town has elected a Tory MP since .But the internal recriminations follow on the back of an uptick in fortunes for Labour as more results came in over the weekend, with the party dominating in the mayoral elections, claiming  of the  posts being contested in cities and metropolitan regions across England.Labour secured shock victories in the West of England and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough while banking comfortable wins in Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region, and holding onto London and Bristol.West Yorkshire is set to announce who its first regional mayor will be on Sunday.Welsh Labour also equalled its best results record, with First Minister Mark Drakefordrsquos party winning half the seats in the Senedd, only one short of an outright majority.The Liberal Democrats were also celebrating victories, taking

Simply because until you have planning permission you don’t have a product.“And the market moves, so a figure now could be out of date in six month’s time. I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Photo: Aidan O#ReillyMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA fth of all EU border checks are now happening in Northern Ireland, the government has said. Senior sources in London have urged the EU to adopt a more pragmatic approach towards the Northern Ireland Protocol and ease the restrictions. It comes ahead of a visit by Lord Frost, Boris Johnson’s adviser on Brexit, to Northern Ireland this week to meet local businesses and the Executive. There have been repeated calls from unionists for the protocol, which was negotiated as part of the UK’s exit deal from the EU, to be replaced. The subject has been raised amid a DUP leadership contest this week. According to the Government, % of all EU checks are between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a system officials have said is unsustainable and causing businesses and consumers to struggle.Speaking to the Sunday , one adviser said Northern Ireland’s prosperity, described as “the bedrock to peace”, was more dependent on east-west than north-south trade. A senior government source said: “The protocol was always a delicate balance.We made huge compromises, in the best possible spirit, to avoid a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement – listening to the genuine concerns raised by Brexit. The protocol does many good things but the balance that it sought to achieve is under risk and the UK’s internal market is being undermined.”The resignation of Arlene Foster as First Minister and DUP leader was blamed for the issues with the way the protocol is operating. The attempt by the EU to impose a hard border on the island of Ireland in the row over vaccine supplies was “hugely destabilising”, the source said. It’s despite attempts to “try and make” the protocol work by “dedramatising and focusing on practicalities”, the source continued. However, the abortive triggering of Article  has been hugely destabilising and the EU does not realise the damage they have caused,” the source said. “It took the moral force out of the protocol in one move and completely undermined Arlene Foster’s attempt to make it work.”A Whitehall source said: “No government can stand by as businesses and consumers struggle.If we cannot find pragmatic solutions, nothing can be left off the table,” they added.

It comes as Minister for Agriculture in the Republic Charlie McConalogue has insisted that high Covid- infection rates in the north-west are “not a Border issue”.Health Minister Robin Swann wrote to his Dublin counterpart Stephen Donnelly saying non-essential cross-border travel must be stopped “by enforcementrequired”.In a letter on Wednesday, Mr Swann warned of a “fresh increase of community transmission of Covid-”.He said both governments should do everything possible to prevent non-essential cross-border travel.Ministers in the south have given no indication that the Government intends to prevent non-essential cross-border travel as a result.Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics programme, Mr McConalogue, a Donegal TD, was pressed on whether there should be enforcement measures to prevent cross border travel.Mr McConalogue welcomed what he said was Mr Swann’s willingness to work on a cross-border basis in dealing with the virus.He said: “We have seen, for example in Donegal here, a very close correlation with Derry and Strabane in relation to infections over the last number of months” but he also highlighted the rollout of vaccines on both sides of the border.“I think the key point here is that it’s not a border issue, it’s a regional issue, and we have to work together as we gradually reopen,” he said. The key message as we go forward the key message is continuing to be cautious, he added.He said: “From [Monday] we’re in the situation because of the increasing rollout of vaccination to be able to allow inter-county, non-essential travel.“And that’s because we’ve got into that space and likewise that is the situation in Northern Ireland.“So I think it’s really good that people can now travel between counties for non-essential purposes but in doing that our clear message to everyone is to continue to stay safe and continue to be very aware of the possibility of infectionwe let our guard down.”Dr Tom Black, the chairman of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, told the programme he does not believe enforcement is necessary at this point.He said more people have been vaccinated in the Republic than in Northern Ireland and the vaccination programme has worked well to keep transmission of the infection down, especially in older people who are most vulnerable.It’s mostly under s getting the infection and they aren’t as much at risk,” he said. It’s very clear from living in the northwest what’s happening here. Young people are aggregating to have a few drinks in the back garden, they get very cold and go inside and then half of them get the infection from the one person who brought it in.

That is why we need meaningful, fit for purpose Online Harms legislation as soon as possible, and I continue to press the Government for such an outcome.”Chair of the Assembly’s All Party Group on Press Freedom and Media Sustainability, Matthew O’Toole said the incident raised a number of concerns.“It is very worrying that any journalist or media organisation would have their account locked for reporting a legitimate public interest story, especially one concerning organised crime,” the SDLP South Belfast MLA said.“I am glad that Twitter have apologised and reversed their decision. But it is a chilling reminder of the power of Big Tech in  and the willingness of powerful people to silence reporting they do not like.“In an age when social media s have failed to take action on anonymous smears and allowed misinformation to fly around the globe, it is unacceptable that they would bow to apparent pressure and silence media in this way.“Powerful people, whether politicians or crime bosses, should not get to decide what journalists report.”Editor-in-chief of the Belfastand the Sunday Le, Eoin Brannigan said the issue “has clear implications for the freedom of the press”.“This is matter of great concern to us, as was the outrageous advice that to unlock the account we had to remove the tweets in question, one of which referred to a factual story about a man who has been identied in the High Court in Dublin as a senior figure in organised crime on a global scale. Nothing in the article constitutes ‘private information’,” Mr Brannigan said.“Twitter instructed us to censor ourselveswe wanted to continue to use the accounts in question.“We put a series of questions to Twitter but received no answers. It’s very coincidental that the two tweets in question refer to Daniel Kinahan, yet Twitter won’t explain how enforcement action was taken in error. Given the volume of nasty abuse Twitter allows to circulate every hour, how come these two tweets were deemed worthy of the locking of accounts yet millions more go unchecked ”A Twitter spokesperson apologised and said the enforcement action was taken in error.“We took enforcement action on the accounts you referenced in error. This has been reversed, and access to the accounts has been reinstated,” they said.Belfast Most ReadLynda Bryans: why I split from Presbyterian ChurchSketrick Island house offers stunning views of Co Down coastUVF tip-offs lead PSNI to ponds close to where Lisa Dorrian disappearedRevealed: Earning power of eight famous faces in Northern Ireland Gail Walker, Editor-at-LargeOpinionMartina Anderson was jailed for le for republican terrorism...now like so many women she’s been sidelinedTop VideosPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayElections : The results so farLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases reported as minister claims high northwest infection rates ‘not a border issue’Fth of all EU border checks happening in Northern IrelandHundreds gather for veterans rally as Dennis Hutchings’ lawyers claim he is being treated ‘worse than Harold Shipman’Pair arrested over police officer murder bid released from custodySuzanne BreenOpinionMoment has surely come for Doug Beattie to become UUP leader following Aiken’s resignationLatestCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases reported as minister claims high northwest infection rates ‘not a border issue’Graham Potter rues missed chance to secure survival after late defeat at WolvesFth of all EU border checks happening in Northern IrelandWolves hit back to beat Brighton after Lewis Dunk’s red cardHundreds gather for veterans rally as Dennis Hutchings’ lawyers claim he is being treated ‘worse than Harold Shipman’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its time to get balls whizzing around coaching sessions, in house games on tap and a multitude of fixtures.Supporters will be absent. As will the use of dressing rooms. But thats okay. In time thatll . For now players need action. Thats the priority, though it would be a nice touchsome of the older fans, who have already been vaccinated, could get out to see a game.This column has also been pushing for the importance of young people getting out and active. The buzz from the endorphins flying around the body is one aspect, but the social interaction they have missed has been colossal.Underage coaches dont realise how much of an influence they have on the players under their watch. From interviewing players from ious teams for nostalgic features, they will often recall their early days playing sport.Just last week, former Ballinderry player Martina Devlin described Rita Moran, a coach at St Marys Magherafelt, as a fantastic person and mentor, a role model and the most influential person on her camogie career. It was more than just sport.As teams go back to training, it makes me think how clubs have a second chance to make a first impression on our youth. Just as a teacher can shape the career path of a student, a coach and sporting memories will determine how far a player will develop. You cant make a horse drink, but it still has to be brought to the water first.Seamus Downey still talks about Laveys one ball each philosophy at underage that helped hone a group of youngsters at a club languishing in the realms of B football into one of the top sides in Ulster. Their indoor facility was a help, but working on the basic skills all year round has worked wonders.The same can be said for Glen, who got their house in order before totally dominating underage football with a group that has their seniors jostling for a place at the top table. People will point to the size of their catchment area, but it wasnt until they organised themselves properly that things started to change.Underage coaching in clubs should be about bringing everyone up a level.Not only will it give everyone an enjoyable experience, which is the number one priority, But, in the long term, it will be a much healthier club.I always remember chatting to Crossmaglen player Cathal Short and looking on with envy at their success. What made them stand out  Yes, they had county players like himself, Oisin McConville, the McEntees and Francie Bellew. But, in club football, , on a given day, the county players from each team were to cancel each other out, Cross other players were of a higher standard. This made the dference.His uncle Aidan, a coach at the club and former teacher in St Patricks Maghera, spoke at an underage coaching camp I attended one weekend in St Marys Magherafelt. He revealed something that has always stuck out.Other clubs in Armagh judged themselves on being able to beat Crossmaglen at underage level. A victory over the Rangers constituted a successful year.In Cross, their benchmark was for the minor team to produce at least four players, every year, to push into the senior  the following season.They didnt concentrate on just the elite. Some years they would churn out more, but four was always the target. Underage medals were a welcome addition and driving the standards of coaching would iniably have them at the cutting edge of competitions.Their underage teams seeing All-Ireland titles being paraded into the hall helped with the motivation, but it still doesnt kick the ball over the bar for you.The biggest challenge in the GAA is giving everyone a chance to play on a regular basis. The Go Games format at the younger ages has been brilliant in terms of smaller sided games. Not only does it give more touches, but a  of  can be split into three teams of seven. There will be no subs and everyone has the chance to test their coaching in a game.The problem started at U level, with full dug-outs. A bigger club, of which there are a few, can add in a few extra Us to take the total to  and enter two U teams. Its not ideal,there is a case of playing across two codes – football and hurling or camogie.The case mentioned above is common, with three teams of seven becoming a team of , with  subs. This is where underage coaches need to ask themselves questions How can I finish the season with  players still coming to coaching sessions  We have all heard stories of the top three or four players not going as far as senior level. Emigration, injury, a loss of interest or their sheer size at underage no longer allowing them to dominate a game at minor level and above.In the long term, its bringing everyone up the ranks so that come senior level, there are enough numbers to field senior and reserve teams with regularity. Thats a healthy club.Bringing more players up through the underage grades is more important than success. Winning the odd trophy is great andyou are able to win U, U, U and minor titles while bringing everyone along, then thats the ultimate.Underage players will stick with youthey are getting games. In a squad of , like above, starting the same team every week is criminal. Ten minutes at the end of a game every week isnt development. It is tokenism.The greatest prize you can give anyoneis a starting jersey. Based on attendance at training, everyone should be given a chance to play a full game as often as possible. If someone is seen as a key player, use games to rotate them into dferent positions. Challenge them to use their weaker side, to develop a dummy. Give them the best possible chance to better themselves. By senior level, they will thank you for it.If you have big numbers at training, ide them up and play seven a side games. Two teams on, the other working on skills with another coach before swapping places. Introduce a competition every so often. Count the blocks, count the assists, count the dummies. Stick a photo of the winning player up on the club social media. Anything to keep things fresh.It is up to coaches at nursery level to give players the skill base. By U, they should be playing as many games as possible. And the more they get at training, the better placed they are to shine in a league game.When the final bell tolls for the season,a coaching group can still boast the same amount of players, they have delivered in spades for them.Thats the sort of impression a coach will leave on a child.

I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job.

Thats always been Cormac ODoherty. From the U playing in goals for Slaughtneils Feacuteile team, with a stick almost as big as him, to playing in the field at home with his older brothers and sisters, he has always had to learn fast. He sits relaxed in Owenbegs canteen. Wearing a customary red baseball hat and the same ice cool look as standing over frees on pitches across Ulster and beyond. Now , he has eight seasons of senior championship hurling under his belt with Slaughtneil and going into a fth at county level, having been called up by Collie McGurk in Derrys Nicky Rackard winning season. A veteran now. googletag.cmd.push “Maybe,” comes the reply, with a smirk and the same affable nature in which it was offered. “Its starting to feel that way, there are a lot of young boys involved so I am getting to the older half of the group now.” Last season, Slaughtneil hurling boss Michael McShane handed him the captains role and last Tuesday night he was appointed as Derry captain. “This is another big step, it is a challenge and something to look forward to...something that hopefully will be a successful one,” he points out. The new role doesnt bring pressure. The new skipper points to the leaders in the squad that still includes Sean Cassidy, captain under John McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push “We have a lot of players who have played big games, a lot of leaders and it is up to everyone to step up to the mark,” he adds. Personally, its about performing as well as he can. And hopefully the results will fall into place. Looking ahead, Sundays Mayo game is as far as he ventures. And looking back, the two promotion finals stick in the throat, but they are yesterdays news. “Thats done and dusted now, its a dferent year, its a dferent management, a few dferent players and a few dferent teams, so it is a new challenge,” he said.     In the last two seasons, Derrys scoring average was - versus - against. The margins are small. Goalkeeper Sean Kelly saved their bacon on many occasions, but at the other end they didnt lt the green flag often enough to trouble teams, when it matters. ODoherty is often the man picking open defences for club and county. He feels they need to be more clinical in the final third. “Its in the tight games, with a point or two each way. Its maybe that we can create them , but we didnt take them. It is costly in tight games.” It will be the third county management he has played under and he is enthused about having Cormac Hippy Donnelly in the frame, who coached Slaughtneil to two Ulster senior titles. “It is hard to put your finger on it,” said ODoherty of the input of Donnelly, who was a popular addition with the Derry players. “Mickeyhad been there and he came in with new ideas to the group and a fresh voice that gave us a bit of renewed energy. A new coach always brings new ideas. “Then you have Woodyssuccess with thecamogs, thats two experienced men. “They were good players and Cormac is new into management, we saw in Slaughtneil what he brings to the setup. “Then you back that up with Conorand Kevin , two players who gave a lot to Derry hurling and have that Derry experience, so hopefully that will stand to them.” Murray won back to back Ulster medals with Derry in and . “It is somethingthat we dont have the opportunity to do any more,” ODoherty adds. “He is somebody who had success with Derry senior hurlers and won major honours, it is great to see that and he brings something dferent to the party as well.” Of the  new players in this years , his brother Oisin makes a , with Gerald Bradley, Conor McAllister, Niall Ferris and Brian Cassidy. “It is a strong  of players,” Cormac states. “Ferryhas committed and it is something we have worked on over the past number of years, getting the best players out. We have managed that and it is a good opportunity to take advantage of it.” It has been something that has been a theme since Collie McGurk took over in , of getting the best players hurling for the county. “Collie was a big believer in getting the best players on the pitch and well see what happens after that. “Dominic and Cormac have put a very strong  together, it is up to the players to make use of it.” Getting off to a winning start in Mayo on Sunday is crucial. Despite the Kildare game poised in the distance as a potential top of the table clash in the group, ODoherty is keeping his thoughts in the short term. Any mention of the Christy Ring Cup is casually brushed off. If you start looking too far down the line youll get caught,” he said. “Our focus is on the Mayo game,you lose that then you are chasing for the rest of the league, so it is important to get a good start.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Collie McGurk took them from the Nicky Rackard Cup to the cusp of a Christy Ring Cup Final. An inspired goalkeeping performance from Kildare goalkeeper Paddy McKenna thwarted theirto Croke Park. Two years ago, John McEvoy came in as boss and an impressive season took them back to the league decider, where Derry lost to Wicklow in a low scoring afternoon at a blustery Inniskeen. A day when Brian Oacuteg McGilligan hobbled off after  minutes and the appearance of Brendan Rogers wasnt able to spark the goal they needed to take them over the line. googletag.cmd.push Last year, after ticking along nicely, Covid kicked in and when the league final was played, Derry werent at the races. It wasnt even a contest. Dominic Woody McKinley came in as joint manager this season, alongside Cormac Donnelly. McKinley, who managed both Derry senior hurlers and camogs in the past, knows what he wants from this season. “My personal opinion is that the National League is more important than the championship to us,” McKinley outlined. He has been around the block. An All-Ireland winner with Loughgiel in , an All-Ireland Final appearance with Antrim in , he coached Antrim at all levels and was a major cog in Slaughtneils rise to the pinnacle of camogie. googletag.cmd.push Sitting at Derry hurlers press evening last week, there is enthusiasm as he talks hurling. The words flow with a passion. The facial expressions dont tell any lies. Its about getting Derry up a level. There is a hurt that hurlers below the elite, top level counties dont get the recognition. Counties like Derry. Seven or eight of their squad are capable of playing at any level. When the Champion  - the All-Star team from the Christy Ring, Nicky Rackard and Lory Meagher Cups – was announced, Derry werent represented. “I suppose you have to earn that,” Woody admits. “The only way is to keep your head down, work hard and then people will recognise you as a group.     “I want Derry to get up a league, you get more of a profile for the players and get to play against better teams. “If you are playing at a higher standard, it is more attractive for the media and hurling people. If I had a choice, Id love to get moved up a league.” As our conversation continues, Liaison Officer Terry Gray issues a list of the Derry squad. Of the  names, Alan Grant is in rehab from a knee injury last year. The  is open, but McKinley is happy with the squad. Brian Cassidy, Niall Ferris and Gerald Bradley are back on board to give them extra attacking options. There is afor Slaughtneil goalkeeper Oisin ODoherty, who last donned the Derry goalkeeper jersey in  having played outfield the previous year. “That was the first thing we looked at before we got the job, could me and Cormac draw all these players all back in again,” he points out. Dual players arent on the table. Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers have played under the last two management teams. But it was a balancing act. The fixture calendar doesnt permit it. Mark Craig is managing his long-term back injury. Brian Cassidy and Conor McAllister are doubts for the Mayo game, but everyone should be available for selection. Challenge games arent on the menu. It frustrates McKinley, so an in-house game last weekend will have to do as they sharpen the focus for the season ahead. “A lot of wee niggly injuries are there now that club training has started as well,” adds McKinley, as frustration creeps into his voice, from the increased workload on the players. “We want to manage it so they are there for the full season for club and county.” There is a plea to clubs, who wont have their serious business until the heel of the year. “These matches are very important for Derry hurling as well,” he adds, while hailing the support of Chairman Stephen Barker. “He is very fair,” Woody states. “He is wanting progress. It is a serious business and we need to be serious about getting themup a level and thats what the players want.” The closest Derry came to promotion was their  decider, a day when Wicklows goal was the dference. Its Derrys failure to find the net that has left them on the wrong side of tight games. During the off-season, selector Conor Murray has been looking into the scoring statistics and Derrys know where the gains are to be made. “He came back to us and it is interesting reading,” McKinley said. “If you were looking at it from another teams point of view, you could think theyll capitalise on our team by blocking a couple of players off in our forward line and wed be in serious bother. “So we are looking for a greater spread of scores,you look at the players we have, there is no doubt we can.” McKinley questions Derrys team play, shot selection...all the pieces of the puzzle of their scoring conundrum. “Thats what weve been going over this last few weeks and hopefully we can get more out of it,” he continues. “We are even recording what we are scoring in our training games, what we do in each sector, to seeour scoring averages are up.” Now the challenge is taking it to Castlebar on Sunday.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council are coming together to set up and manage the Creative Encounters project. The aim of the project is to create a one-stop online directory for people and families planning a day out in either or both counties. The councils have now issued a tender seeking companies who could create such a directory. In a joint statement included in the tender documents, the two councils state that they had commissioned an audience survey across the north west in a bid to better understand the barriers to cultural engagement faced by our citizens. googletag.cmd.push “This research was used to inform a subsequent Audience Development Plan which identied older people and families as two key audience target segments. “Older people were identied as a segment that was the least engaged with cultureand the partner councils were keen to ensure that this imbalance was addressed. “Families were identied as a market opportunity, an audience segment upon which the sector could focus the rebuilding of audiences and participatory engagement as we emerge from the worst of the Covid crisis. “The NW Audience Survey research findings and the NW Audience Development Plan The plan incorporates a range of actions designed to encourage better engagement of the target segments.” googletag.cmd.push As part of the process, the councils have looked at websites such as familyexplorers, dayoutwiththekids and fantasticforfamilies. They now want to create a similar website focused on the Derry and Donegal regions. “In essence the project is designed to make it simpler for families to plan days out by providing all the practical information in one place,” the council statement concluded.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement today, the Trufelli family said that as thingsto a more favourable economic environment, it is their intention to re-market the business for sale. “Whilst our hope is that we will be able to sell the business as a going concern, we recognise that it may not be possible to find a suitable purchaser,” the statement said. googletag.cmd.push “As a result, we have appointed Savills and Philip Tweedie  Company to market the site as both a going concern and a development opportunity. “Barry’s continues to remain closed in line with Covid restrictions and will not re-open until the sale process has concluded.” The Barrys site has been placed on the market with a guide price of pound.m.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net.

Qualiers RLongford - Derry -Longford earned a dramatic win in a chaotic finish at Pearse Park. There was controversy too. Derrys Barry McGoldrick, who had marauded forward from corner-back to grab two goals, picked up a second yellow card after a melee in the Longford goalmouth in the th minute of injury time. Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

The gap was narrower still by almost the midway point of the second half, when Glenn Ryans side pulled themselves back to within two at - to -.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities. Raising money for these charities was always important to Patrick as his mother sadly passed away from the disease when he was young, she said.ldquoHe never missed any of the parties and when The Proclaimers came on I always remember Pat taking centre stage and all of us had to follow him and his actions and it was always very important we did it right.ldquoThis is one memory of Pat we will never forget.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

It didnrsquot sink in until I was driving away from the ceremony and it was a great feeling.The jump jockey star first began his interest in horses after watching the races at Downpatrick Racecourse with his family when he was just eight years old. Since then, he carried on visiting the local racetrack with friends and soon caught the racing bug.ldquoI went to a few point-to-pointers with the McCartan family who we know well. It wasnrsquot long after that I got on the saddle for the first time and I got going from there, said Danny.The golden boy started off with Downpatrick trainer Brian Hamilton before working with group one winning flat trainer Ger Lyons in Kildare.On the advice of former Grand National winner Tony Dobbin, Danny then made his big move across the water to Penrith in Cumbria to work under the highly respected trainer Nicky Richards at his famous Greystoke stables.ldquoI was only  when I turned professional and made the move to England. I was very nervous, but Nicky made me feel really welcomed and I settled in quickly, he recalled.ldquoIt was tough at the beginning to be fair but Nicky is very easy to get on with and he knew it was going to be dficult for me.

We have competed a lot together and Irsquove developed my skills with him a lot, we have picked up six or seven wins this season together he said.ldquoThat horse has helped me get to the grade one stage of racing, especially after our massive grade two win.That grade two success was when Danny and Nuts Well secured first place in the valuable Old Roan at Aintree. Nuts Well was picked for an outsider in the race at  , but the talented rider once again showed he was worth his salt as he galloped to glory.This gave Northumberland trainer Ann Hamilton her biggest success to date as they claimed the pound, prize pot.Despite his interest and success in racing, Danny was the first in his family to become heavily involved in the sport.ldquoI come from a sporting background in my family, my two brothers played Gaelic football and soccer growingup, but I was the one who took it upon myself to get into the horses, he said.ldquoOf course my family supported me and helped me achieve were I am today, but I do not come from a racing background.Dannyrsquos parents, Brenda and Denis, were delighted as their son received recognition for an outstanding season and hope that this is just the beginning for the promising young talent.ldquoWe are so proud of him, he has done all of this off his own back, said Brenda.ldquoHe has worked extremely hard to get to this point and I am so glad he is living his dream.ldquoEven though I canrsquot watch his big hurdle races until the final straight as I always have a motherrsquos worry, she added.Danny spent a brief time back with family in Downpatrick but is getting back to business as usual in England.ldquoI just plan on keeping my head down and hope to bring the momentum from this season into the next one, he said.ldquoEverything wouldnrsquot be possible without the help from all of the team at the stables and my familyrsquos support.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost.

Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Local agencies cannot be left alone to pick up the pieces and restore this fragile habitat.ldquoThe environment minister must urgently convene a cross-departmental taskforce that brings together the experience, focus and most importantly, resources, in order to meet the unprecedented challenges in rejuvenating this area.Mr Hazzard said the scenes of environmental destruction left in the Mournes as a result of the inferno show the urgent need to protect precious habitats, especially our peatlands.He added: ldquoIf managed correctly, peatlands play an important role in supporting rich ecosystems, improving water quality and also protecting our communities from the localised consequences of climate change.ldquoFor some time now a draft peatlands strategy has sat with the minister awaiting publication there can be no more delay.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering. They make it far too easy for people to be irresponsible by putting them directly on the ground and then leaving them there afterwards.ldquoLiving in an area of natural beauty we have many areas were people see fit to light a barbecue. The recent events have shown us we cannot take the risk. The earth is too fragile and the danger to humans and wildle is too great.

Please try again later.Submitting...I remember this well because it was one of the first major in-depth news reports that I covered as a then relatively novice reporter.The investigation related to Paragraph  of those talks.The web version of this article will include the full wording of that paragraph, which said that the Irish and British governments “recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April ”It went on to say that such people would,convicted, benefit from early release under the Belfast Agreement and “would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued”• See below for full wording of paragraph This was not said to be a general amnesty but rather to relate to people who have been charged but not convicted of an offence, such as those who have jumped bail before or during trial. However, there was concern that the paragraph had been vaguely worded to placate Sinn Fein and would provide a future basis for an amnesty for all terror offences committed pre .It raised the notion that for the first time the UK was conceding that suspects would not necessarily have to answer terrorist charges against them. “We are in the realms of legal revolution,” Austen Morgan, an expert in constitutional law, told me. “We would normally leave these matters to the DPP.”Stephen Farry, then the Alliance Party’s justice spokesman, said: “Until now, it has always been the policy of the governments to regard terrorist activities as criminal offences, albeit politically-motivated ones. This proposal risks giving the impression that actions of republican and loyalist paramilitaries were legitimate.” Dr Farry expressed surprise that other political parties had been relatively quiet over the proposals, believing that the implications of the clause had been underestimated. “In every prosecution you are making a general point as well as particular point,You are saying these things are wrong.”In the end the paragraph never came to pass, due to delays in paramilitary decommissioning.Stormont would in fact fall over such disagreements the next year, and the amnesty proposal of  would also come to nothing.We now know that Tony Blair went on to instigate a secret scheme for On The Runs including Letters of Comfort and even Royal Pardons.You could say that the UK has been determined to end prosecutions for exactly  years.But in fact there has been an informal amnesty since . After all, how feasible was it that Martin McGuinness would be made deputy first minister — a position which, Sinn Fein love to point out, is in effect joint first minister — and then arrested and made to face a criminal trial followed by a jail term His funeral was attended by a host of dignitaries from President Bill Clinton to the first minister Arlene Foster to the chief prosecutor to the head of the PSNI and others.In  the ex RUC assistant chief constable Alan McQuillan wrote on these pages that future legacy crime investigators might face “political pressure, not least from the two governments, not to pursue those whose arrest might ‘destabilise the peace process’”.Yet while no IRA leader has ever faced charges commensurate with their decades of pre meditated murder and mayhem, several soldiers face homicide trials for single shootings.I see real problems with this reported UK plan on prosecutions. But I do not blame them for seeking radical solutions to the scandal of how legacy is panning out.• Paragraph  of the  Weston Park talks document: “Both Governments also recognise that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on cease-fire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before  April . Such people would,convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and will as soon as possible, and in any event before the end of the year, take such steps as are necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this dficulty so that those concerned are no longer pursued.”• Ben Lowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingOther articles by Ben Lowry below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Ben Lowry May : Unionism can’t just be about managing long-term defeat• Ben Lowry May : Arlene Foster was given huge opportunity by DUP after her exit helped ruin UUP• Ben Lowry April : NI seems to rely increasingly on just one pollster for data on attitudes to a border poll• Ben Lowry April : DUP still has to choose between managing this disaster or total rejection of it• Ben Lowry April : His enduring marriage to the Queen was key to our understanding of Prince Philip• Ben Lowry April : Radio grilling of UUP leader exposed folly of unionists blaming Simon Byrne for funeral• Ben Lowry Mar : There should not be an Irish language act, but it is too late — the DUP has agreed one• Ben Lowry Mar : We have made it through the worst of the dark, dreaded winter lockdown• Ben Lowry Mar : MLAs lost control of abortion by rejecting modest law reform• Ben Lowry Mar : Whatever future Boris Johnson adopts for Northern Ireland seems set to lead to a crisis• Ben Lowry Mar : Scotland tunnel isn’t fantasy, but something kids of today might see• Ben Lowry Mar :  The cost of victims’ pension has ballooned without explanation as to why \u2029• Ben Lowry Feb : Unionists have fully turned against Irish Sea border because they’ve seen the scale of disaster• Ben Lowry Feb : We still lack answers as to why IRA funeral got special treatment at Roselawn• Ben Lowry Feb : Peter Robinson has long experience of what is and is not politically feasible• Ben Lowry Feb : There is barely any unionist support for violence, despite justied anger at sea border• Ben Lowry Jan : At last, clear reason for UK and unionists to stop being weak towards Ireland EU• Ben Lowry Jan : Lockdown sceptics have been undermined by crazy theories, but sensible criticisms haven’t gone away• Ben Lowry Jan : The Irish Sea border was imposed because UK knew unionists would take it• Ben Lowry in : Last night unionists celebrated a move towards Irish unity——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Who remembers the itinerant dispensary of Avon products, queen of s suburbia  JOANNE SAVAGE reminds us she hasn’t gone away you knowBy Joanne SavageSaturday, th May , : am  \"       \"  The Avon Lady, cosmetic heroine of s suburbiaEveryone of a certain vintage will remember the ‘Avon lady’ calling, usually a kind of overdone suburban Stepford we clone with immaculate hair, pillbox hat, and powdered visage, coming up the garden path with her glossy catalogue of lipsticks, nail nishes, skincare products and the like, maybe an array of samples of a cheap perfume, lavender scented face lotion or miracle shampoo on offer for you to sample.‘Ding, dong, it’s the Avon lady!” they would chirrup, these cosmetic godmothers of s suburbia, sort of like a door-to-door agony aunt as well as an itinerant dispensary of magical bargain solutions to lacklustre cheeks, lips that looked unkissable, skin the colour of dirty underwear that needed the apposite Avon unguent to appear peachy, pearly and bedazzled once more. Who remembers the haloed vision of Dianne Weist as Pegg Boggs, the Avon lady in Edward Scissorhands, with the aforementioned pillarbox hat, pale violet dress suit, and kindly demeanour, assured that one of the cosmetic line’s weird potions may even remedy humanoid Edward’s deathly pallor     \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Today there are .m representatives world wide, with the company making an estimated annual revenue of £.bn.“The mission of the company is to empower women,” says the CEO of Avon, Andrea Jung. “The business may have been started by a man, but in the s it was an unpopular thing to give women the opportunity to earn outside the home. It’s about giving women earning opportunities.” Avon spokeswoman, Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon, is just one of the celebritieswho has helped combat the brand’s occasionally mumsy, bargain basement image, and fundraised for their female-focused causes – such as breast cancer and domestic violence.Avon looks set to be calling at many more UK homes, after the cosmetics company revealed in July that the number of people signing up to be sales representatives had more than doubled under lockdown.The company said it had seen a % “surge” in the number of new representatives joining its UK business since lockdown began.So despite the qauint image of the preened Avon lady of old, it looks like the company has new cachet, an ever growing number of willing women armed with their catalogues and lipsticks, ready to take on the world.Every woman knows that beauty is a weapon, le is a battle and the right lippie can make you feel set to make men fall at your feet en route to world domination.The Avon lady is like a feminist warrior, bonding with women over cosmetics, generating debate and empowering women to look, feel and live better.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSam McBride: Don’t assume Edwin Poots is more hardline than Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – the truth is more nuancedBen Lowry: Let us hope that the brilliant Eoghan Harris keeps on writingSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredNorthern Ireland Centenary rose proves a thorn in the side for Sinn FeinVeteran DUP man: I’m happy with loyalist protests – even illegal onesMost PopularJohn O’Dowd’s bogus comparison of Northern Ireland and South Africa suggests he has no experience of apartheidSam McBride: From his s, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was seen as a future unionist leader – now might be his final chanceSteven Aiken resigns as he tells Ulster Unionists: We need new leadershipNI man dies after falling into riverIf Isis suspect so much as sets foot in Northern Ireland, arrest her, says senior unionist                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommendedPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The official daily death count has stayed over , for the past  days.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Nisha said the -year-old, who had worked in travel and tourism and lived in Bahrain, recently retired and moved back home to live in Bangalore in southern India.Sadly, he contracted coronavirus in March and was hospitalised. Dr Satyavir SinghalSpeaking from her home in south Belfast, Nisha said: “The care in the ICU wasn’t the care which one would have expected.- even in the private hospitals.”She said her sister had paid a “phenomenal amount of money” for his treatment, but added, “nothing could save him.”“It was a terrible situation. The poor girlhad to go through hell. “Even to get the death certicate and to get the paperwork sorted out has been a nightmare for her. “The funeral she had to do all by herself - there was nobody there.”Nisha Tandon is the founder and director of award-winning ethnic arts organisation, ArtsEkta and the creative force behind the Belfast Mela: an international showcase of music, dance, art, and food from more than  nations around the globe, held every summer in Belfast’s Botanic Gardens. She was also the driving force behind the development of the Indian Community Centre in Belfast and in  was awarded an OBE for services to the minority sector. Originally from New Delhi, she came to Northern Ireland in  as a young bride in an arranged marriage to Vijay, whose family first settled here in the s.Nisha said watching the television coverage of the pandemic sweep her native home is “just heartbreaking.”“Being so far away you cannot really do anything. The only support you can give is moral support by a phone call or by emails or video calls.“My entire family is in India. I am the only one who is here from my maternal side. From my father’s side I have cousins who are living in Birmingham.“It is very scary. We keep in touch with every single member of the family the older generation, we need to really worry about. There are so many cousins who are isolating and my aunties and uncles are isolating. “It is a dire situation and the aftermath is going to be even worse than it is now. There are going to be a lot of children who will be left with no parents and a lot of fathers will be left with no sons and a lot of sons will be left with no fathers. Especially in the very remote villages where it has reached and obviously in cities you can see what is happening they are showing it on every single news.“People are helpless - we saw it here and our hearts broke, while our systems here are much more robust. When you see the systems over thereyour heart breaks.”Nisha added there have been a lot of deaths in the Indian community in Northern Ireland due to Covid, but these have not been widely reported on. ArtsEkta has teamed up with the Isha Foundation to help raise funds for the devastating impact of Covid  in India. “It is a really, really bad situation in India and we have started to do a little bit of fundraising. “Whatever anyone can give, every little will help. It will go to the people who need support. Robin Swann has been really good sending three containers of oxygen from NI, but then remember India was also sending vaccinations to Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK.” To donate visit:️ https:www.totalgiving ... Isha-Europe-Corona-ReliefSusan Gillenlives in Jordanstown and tries to avoid watching television coverage of the pandemic in India.“It is so distressing, it’s like a horror film,” she said. Susan’s anguish is compounded by the fact her -year-old father, Dr John Mathai, is currently “trapped” in Kerala. “My father was a consultant geriatrician in Northern Ireland for many years and when he retired in  he went to live in London. “The whole year of isolation in London made him decide he would go to India for the winter. He left in November and he was due to come back on St Patrick’s Day, but because of his age he didn’t feel he would survive the quarantine when he ed to London, so he decided to stay on in India. “Obviously he wants to come back, but who knows when that is going to happen now with India on the red list for travel. We can’t get out to visit there, which is frustrating and upsetting. What can you do from so far away ”Susan FaceTimes her father quite often and said he is “quite calm and collected” about the situation.“He’s also quite circumspect about not travelling around or meeting too many people - he’s sensible. He’s not in a high state of fright or distress, but he’s very upset watching the other states, like the Punjab, which are in a really terrible way.”The Mathai family have many relatives in the state of Kerala, but Susan said thankfully none of them has died or become very unwell from Covid. “There are a lot of cases in Kerala at the moment, but they seem to have enough oxygen supplies and were better prepared than a lot of other states.”But, she believes the crisis across India has been “terribly mismanaged”.“Indian weddings, religious festivals involving huge gatherings and raucous election rallies involving crowds were all permitted to take place just before the second wave There doesn’t seem to have been measures put in place in the event of a second wave - the feeling was that they had survived the first one, so it didn’t seem to have been a big priority for the governments,”She added:“India was producing vaccines for the whole world and now it’s an embarrassing situation where they are having to rely on foreign aid to pull them out of this hole which they didn’t really have to be inthey had been prepared.”Dr Satyavir Singhal BEM, a consultant anaesthetist with the Belfast Trust, moved from Delhi to Northern Ireland  years ago. Now living in Newtownabbey, he has been watching the coverage of the horric devastation Covid- is causing in his homeland and, naturally, worries about his relatives there. “Sitting here you feel absolutely heartbroken and helpless. There is not a single member of the family who has been spared. Two who were caught in the pandemic, one from my we’s side, her brother’s we - they couldn’t get a hospital bed, but we could buy an oxygen concentrator for her and medication, so she survived and she is out of the woods now.”Dr Singhal said the oxygen concentrator he bought for his sister-in-law would normally cost about £-, but he paid £,, because of a shortage. “My sister’s husband is still in the hospital and my classmate lost both his parents a day apart.”Dr Singhal said he and colleagues in Northern Ireland are liaising with the medical fraternity in India. “They are still learning and hopefully we can guide them in terms of our experience of treatments or in terms of finding a hospital bed.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Under mounting pressure, he backtracked and agreed to step aside in North Belfast to help sitting DUP MP Nigel Dodds in his ultimately ill-fated attempt to defend the seat from Sinn Fein.Some critics believe that unsteady and inconsistent start would come to characterise his entire tenure as leader.When devolution was restored at Stormont two months after he took charge, Mr Aiken, who holds a doctorate in international relations, faced questions on why he chose not to take on the party’s sole ministerial position in the powersharing Executive.He instead handed the role of Health Minister to his predecessor as leader Robin Swann.With the pandemic taking hold within weeks of Stormont’s restoration, Mr Swann would go on to become one of the most high-profile political figures in the Province, winning widespread praise for his efforts to tackle the Covid- emergency.By contrast, his party leader appeared an almost peripheral figure, on the sidelines as the ministerial Executive wrestled with the major political decisions over the coronavirus response.Critics also accused him of being too willing to be led by hardline unionists on some issues.This was the case in the recent fallout over the police handling of the mass republican funeral for former IRA leader Bobby Storey.A decision by prosecutors not to take action against  Sinn Fein politicians who attended the funeral for alleged Covid- restriction breaches saw the leaders of the DUP, TUV and PUP call for Chief Constable Simon Byrne’s resignation.Mr Aiken followed suit, but only  hours later.He then struggled to articulate why he was calling for Mr Byrne’s head in a radio interview on the BBC’s The Nolan Show, exchanges dubbed as a “car crash” by many listeners.In what some characterised as a rush to the right, detractors felt Mr Aiken should have instead concentrated on regaining a foothold in Northern Ireland’s centre ground – territory it has lost to a surging Alliance Party in recent years.On Brexit too, some in the UUP believe Mr Aiken failed to capitalise on the dficulties of the DUP over the Northern Ireland Protocol.The imposition of an Irish Sea border, and a sense among many within the broader unionist family that the DUP is partly to blame for it, should have offered the UUP a chance to put clear blue water between itself and its under-pressure rival.Many within the party believe Mr Aiken has simply not taken that opportunity and, with a crucial Assembly election only  months away, they felt change was needed quickly.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

pandemic, following the Prime Ministerrsquos invitation for her and other devolved leaders to contribute to economic revival plans.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster told the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show that ldquoa majority of people who voted in the constituencies voted for parties that were opposed to a referendum and Ms Sturgeon ldquodidnrsquot secure a majority as Alex Salmond did in

the opportunity to choose our own future in a referendum.ldquoThe fact that we are sitting here having a debate about whether or not that outcome is going to be respected says a lot about the lack of respect for Scottish democracy that this UK Government has demonstrated for quite some time now.The row comes after the Prime Minister invited Ms Sturgeon for crisis talks on the Union, calling for proposals from devolved leaders on how to recover from the pandemic.In his invitation letter to Ms Sturgeon, which she has accepted following her re-election as First Minister, Boris Johnson argued the UK was ldquobest served when we work together.He added: ldquoWe will all have our own perspectives and ideas ndash and we will not always agree ndash but I am confident that by learning from each

legislation from the Scottish Parliament that attempts to engineer a second independence referendum, saying: ldquoWersquore not going near there.Ms Sturgeon, who said she ldquowouldnrsquot rule out putting legislation for a referendum before MSPs early next year, claimed a battle in the courts would be ldquoabsurd and completely outrageous.Elsewhere, the Labour fallout over its poor showing in
