Exam boards have moderated these grades to ensure this year\u0027s results are not significantly higher than previous years.Mr Williamson said: \u0027Grades awarded today will open up the doors of opportunity for young people to progress to the next stage of their lives, whether studying at one of our world-class universities, taking up an apprenticeship or embarking on the start of their careers.\u0027Any students who feel they have grounds for appeal now have the safety net of being able to use their mock results as evidence, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams, thanks to our triple lock process to ensure confidence and fairness in the system.\u0027He added: \u0027The resilience they have shown during these challenging times will serve them well and I wish them all the very best for the future.\u0027Meanwhile the chief executive the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has said she \u0027regrets\u0027 some pupils\u0027 feelings over downgraded results but insisted the moderation system used this year was fair.Fiona Robertson appeared before the Scottish Parliament\u0027s Education Committee yesterday.It follows a Scottish Government U-turn due to anger over nearly 125,000 results being downgraded from teacher estimates by the SQA\u0027s controversial moderation system.The downgraded results will now be withdrawn, reverting to the original estimates.Ms Robertson said everyone at the SQA was \u0027keenly aware of the concerns from young people\u0027 expressed over the past week.In her opening remarks to the committee, she said: \u0027On the basis of the commission that we received from the Scottish Government, there was a clear and unequivocal case for some moderation.\u0027The appeals process would have dealt with any \u0027anomalies\u0027 in the moderated results, she said, while the SQA\u0027s equalities impact assessments showed the results were \u0027fair\u0027.Scottish Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said to her: \u0027I listened with intent to your opening statement but there\u0027s one word I didn\u0027t hear, and that\u0027s the word \u0027sorry\u0027\u0027.She responded: \u0027It was difficult to see the reaction to last week\u0027s results.\u0027But we were asked to fulfil a role and part of that role was to maintain standards across Scotland.\u0027I fully appreciate that, as I highlighted in my opening statement, young people felt that their achievements had been taken outwith their control.\u0027I absolutely get that and of course I regret how young people have felt about this process.\u0027Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer asked if one of the SQA\u0027s statisticians had resigned as the moderating system was being developed and if this was because they had concerns about the system.She confirmed one person had resigned but said: \u0027I\u0027m not privy to the full details of that particular inidual.\u0027It probably wouldn\u0027t be fair for me to go into that in fairness to them.\u0027Scottish Labour\u0027s Iain Gray asked if the SQA signed off on a moderation system \u0027in the sure and certain knowledge that pupils in those schools with a poorer past performance would be more heavily impacted\u0027.Ms Robertson said the moderation process was based on data but \u0027the extraordinary circumstances of the year meant that we were awarding on a basis that I think we would all agree were not ideal because of the cancellation of exams\u0027.The SNP\u0027s Alex Neil raised what he called the \u0027human cost\u0027 of the system, saying he had heard from the family of a young woman who had been left \u0027distraught\u0027 by a downgraded result and refused to eat or leave her room for three days.Referring to previous committee meetings which raised concerns about the methodology, he said: \u0027The SQA absolutely refused to listen to the committee\u0027s point about the need to consult on the methodology before it was approved.\u0027I think everybody and their granny knew that if you used the record of local schools you\u0027d end up with the situation we ended up with - where the moderation process led to two and a half times the downgrades in the poorest areas than happened in the more affluent areas.\u0027Ms Robertson said \u0027where there are lessons to be learned we will learn them\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Paddleboarders clinging lobster pot 17 miles sea 15 hour search","story":"Share this article\u0027They are alive\u0027 -

Now more than 100 street artists and muralists will descend on London for the inaugural London Mural Festival (LMF), which promises to offer accessible art at a time of social distancing.Artists will create murals at more than 50 locations across the capital during next month’s festival which, its organisers say, will allow people to admire art while restrictions are making gallery visiting difficult.The festival is the latest step in the transformation of street art, and follows Banksy’s move to join “blue chip” artists such as Keith Haring, after his work Devolved Parliament sold for almost £10m at Sotheby’s in November.Lee Bofkin, CEO and co-founder of Global Street Art, the organisation behind the LMF, says that unlike major art fairs or exhibitions, which have been cancelled or were operating at reduced capacity because of social distancing, street art was “a non-contact sport” created and viewed outdoors. “You’ve got people up in lifts painting, so they’re not close to members of the public. It’s the kind of thing that you can do at social distance,” he says.The festival will take place across the capital at more than 50 sites, including Wembley Park, King’s Cross, Holborn, Crystal Palace, Canary Wharf, the City, Camden, Hackney Wick and Tottenham. It will also feature a restored mural painted in Whitfield Gardens in Fitzrovia by Mick Jones and Simon Barber in 1980.LMF has worked with councils, residents’ associations, private landlords and commercial partners, including Lend Lease and Quintain, to locate available spaces – not easy in a city where paintable locations are hard to find, Bofkin says.“One of the biggest challenges of a mural festival, and why we think that there hasn’t been a London mural festival before, is because there aren’t the big walls that you might have in an industrial district in Miami or a giant wall that you might find on a Polish tower block built in the 1960s,” he says.While that brings benefits, it has indirect costs, say critics, who believe developers use street art to inflate prices and that it can exacerbate gentrification.Bofkin says there are “complicated issues” around murals and housing but that Global Street Art’s work had helped to reduce the cost of graffiti cleanup for local councils and housing associations, as murals replaced tagging. “Public art is good for creating interest and regenerating spaces, but there is that tension,” says Bofkin. “That’s why we’ve got such a breadth of spaces that we’re trying to paint, including the housing estates.”Camille Walala, who is creating two works as part of LMF, one at Rich Mix in east London and another that will wrap around Canary Wharf’s Adams Plaza Bridge, says the art form was popular because of its accessibility.“When I started around 15 years ago I found the street art was quite dark,” she says. “But what I love about Keith Haring is he just wanted … to give something to people who might not be able to go to museum.”The role of murals has become a major talking point in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. The New Yorker said the “pavement itself has become part of the protest” after the commissioning of several murals in support of the movement in the US sparked criticism from Donald Trump, who called BLM a “hate group”.“If someone’s got something to say that’s political, and it makes sense, then murals and muralism have a part in expressing that,” says Bofkin. “Sometimes you can say something political, you can make a statement and then other times you can just have fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5cb0d9210e69178100761b729589d11c3ae83a1/0_1112_4474_2685/master/4474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=040d061533cb073d126f7458a7e00cc3","title":"rembrandt bearded old man","story":"A young Rembrandt painted this study in his mid-20s, honing his craft with finely layered paintA weekly Guide column in which we dissect the influences and interpretations of a work of artWe feel the burdens of a long life in this man’s furrowed brow.

Pinsker presents a frighteningly real near-future US in which social gatherings have been proscribed due to terrorist attacks and viral plagues. Corporation StageHoloLive transmits virtual music events for the masses, while musician Luce retains some semblance of artistic integrity by playing at illegal underground venues. Meanwhile, Rosemary is a naive recluse, cocooned in virtual reality: when she is offered a job as a talent scout for StageHoloLive, she must leave her comfort zone. Pinsker movingly charts Rosemary’s coming of age story as her world and Luce’s collide.Adrian Tchaikovsky follows his successful Children of Time duology with the standalone The Doors of Eden (Tor, £18.99). The novel draws the reader into a story that expands and deepens the many-worlds theory: on a series of parallel Earths, life has undergone very different evolutions. There is one world where the dominant species is fish who upload identities into computers, another where dinosaurs rule, and even a reality in which rat-like creatures are dominant. The book begins as an intriguing tale of two young women, lovers Lee and Mal, investigating sightings of the Birdman of Bodmin Moor, but quickly escalates into a dizzyingly inventive techno-thriller which explores issues of evolutionary biology and contemporary politics. Emotionally complex and intellectually satisfying, The Doors of Eden will enhance Tchaikovsky’s already considerable reputation.In Micaiah Johnson’s entertaining first novel, The Space Between Worlds (Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton, £14.99), the Eldridge Institute has not only discovered the multiverse, with 380-plus planet Earths alongside Earth Zero, but the means to travel between worlds. Only “traversers”, iniduals whose doppelgangers are dead on another Earth, can make a crossing to collect scientific data for the benefit of the Institute. Enter strong-willed but vulnerable Cara, a young black woman plucked from the hostile wastelands to work for the Institute: her doppelgangers are dead on all but eight parallel Earths, allowing her almost unlimited movement. Having lived a hand-to-mouth existence fighting poverty and abuse, Cara relishes the freedom of interworld travel, but what she discovers on Earth 175 threatens to uncover not only her own terrible secret but that of the enigmatic Institute. Johnson excels at contrasting lives of privilege and poverty, and at drip-feeding information that gradually reveals Cara’s complex character.An ambitious wide-screen space opera debut, The Vanished Birds (Titan, £8.99) by Simon Jimenez tells the story of a erse cast of characters ning eons and light years in an emotionally gripping narrative redolent of Samuel R Delany and Cordwainer Smith. In an exotic far-future universe teeming with life, great bird-like starships journey between worlds in the employ of the vast, heartless Umbai Company. When the captain of a starship lands on an agricultural world, she is persuaded to give passage to a boy who inexplicably fell from the stars. Young Ahro has a nascent talent that will change everything, the ability to transport himself from world to world by the power of his mind alone this is a talent that the ruthless Umbai Company wish to exploit. Part thriller, part coming-of-age story, encompassing romance, planetary escapades and poignant meditations on the passage of time, The Vanished Birds is a moving epic that is much more than the sum of its parts.Billed as a feminist space opera, Seven Devils (Gollancz, £18.99) is the first collaboration between Elizabeth May and Laura Lam. It’s the far future, and an evil empire has the galaxy in its grip. Thec crushes dissent, is perennially at war, and forever expanding. Heroine Eris was once heir to the throne, but turned against the brutal regime and now, with a team of four other women, works to bring the empire, led by her villainous brother Prince Damocles, to its knees. With its well drawn cast of LGBTQ characters, Seven Devils is a curious mixture of the old-fashioned – novels of rebellion against an evil empire are ten-a-penny – and the up-to-the-minute: think Star Wars recast for the modern age. Despite some scientific implausibilities, the novel moves at a cracking pace and, with neat plot twists and cliffhangers, is page-turning fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aacae605d835af3678e1c1881eba70eb5c83a10d/0_354_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d0c4b6d78304635817c2895bd7f8c58","title":"small business cat food opportunities pandemic","story":"Coronavirus has brought human suffering and economic pain but there are always opportunities for entrepreneursThere’s a global pandemic going on. Hundreds of thousands of people have died. Millions are sick. Economic disaster has struck nations worldwide. Hey, anyone care for some delicious cat food?It seems like an odd question to ask. But not for the owners of Smalls, a “direct to consumer” manufacturer of pet food products geared specifically to cats. The company just this past week raised $9m in a round of funding that brought its total amount of capital raised to $12m. And they’re just getting started.“Cat parents want to give their cats the absolute best, but the majority of what’s available is effectively junk food, disguised as health food,” said Matt Michaelson, who founded the company with his friend Calvin Bohn.But this is not just a story about two guys who love cats. It’s a good news small business story that’s getting little attention during a time when so many small businesses are publicly failing, millions are unemployed and economic output has precipitously fallen. Why?Maybe it’s because we don’t want to trivialize the plight of the businesses that are struggling. Or maybe it’s because the media only likes to emphasize the negative and ignore the positive. Or perhaps it’s just that some people don’t really care what their cat eats and if that’s the real reason then shame on them!The fact is that, in the midst of all the bad economic news, some companies continue to thrive and that while so many small businesses are suffering so much hardship, there are many other small business owners and entrepreneurs who are moving forward to achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams. They’re out there, raising capital, working harder than ever, making products and delivering services.Take the cat food market, for example. Thanks to so many people quarantining, pet adoptions have soared. Rescue centers from Kansas to Colorado have literally run out of dog and cats. Companies are offering stipends to help their employees with the cost of pet adoption and ownership. One firm hosts regular Zoom meetups … for dogs. “In the first few weeks of stay-at-home orders, the ASPCA saw a nearly 70 percent increase in animals going into foster care through our NYC and Los Angeles foster programs, compared to the same period in 2019,” Christa Chadwick, vice-president of shelter services at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told US News \u0026amp World Report.All of this means opportunities for firms in the pet industry. Firms like Smalls.According to a TechCrunch report, the company has “several thousand” active subscribers for its products, which is up more than four times over the prior year. The pandemic has created some supply chain challenges, but Michaelson said that the huge rise in pet adoption has driven some pet owners to “look for alternatives” to their local pet store. “Because we’re seeing this big movement towards the direct-to-consumer side of things with Covid, it’s really an opportunity to lean into that and grow faster,” he said.Significant economic disruptions can result in lost sales, disappearing profits and even bankruptcies for some small businesses. But for the others, it opens up new markets and opportunities. E-commerce sales are up this year. Savvy restaurateurs have pivoted to delivery and pop-up offerings. Quick-thinking manufacturers have retooled to make protective equipment and other healthcare items. Oh, and two best friends who started cooking cat food in their Brooklyn kitchen are now expanding their Chicago factory after raising $9m.It’s a good time to be in cat food."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51e250435c28ebdf2698db4688c79a477bf74f1/0_66_1036_622/master/1036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=081e88aae2589392a432387d2ddb7296","title":"new york has grappled with gentrification for years covid has brought it to a head","story":"There’s a strange atmosphere as two competing histories of the city – part true, part myth – jostle togetherA few days earlier, at noon, a woman buying her Card from the ticket machine at the subway had been randomly stabbed in the back by a stranger. A few days after that, there were two muggings in the neighbourhood in quick succession. For a while, the city’s parenting sites have been alive with discussion of New York’s “spike” in violent crime, and the impact of two local hotels lately converted to homeless shelters, on the intake list of which featured several registered sex offenders.There are two narratives of 70s and 80s New York, both resurging and in direct competition. The first is of a crimeridden hellscape, the New York of the Central Park jogger and a mythological place in which no side street is safe and people live in the tunnels of the subway. It’s the New York of Midnight Cowboy, a sordid landscape cherished in the minds of those who lived through it both as war story and a marker of how far the city has come.The second popular version is that of the poets’ New York, the city of Eileen Myles, the Chelsea Hotel, the Poetry Project at St Mark’s Church and the cheap rent of loft space in Soho before Apple moved in. It’s a rendition of the city which, as the value of commercial real estate collapses and affluent families move out, other New Yorkers are anticipating the return of with open arms.It has been a strange thing to watch, over the last few weeks, as the fight between these two camps has taken off and, in certain neighbourhoods and among certain demographics, completely displaced the virus as the number one conversational topic. “New York is going back to the 1970s.” This is the dire and dark warning issued by those who grew up in the city to anyone who arrived later than around the turn of the millennium, and which if you dare to counter, triggers the response, “You weren’t here, you have no idea.” On the opposing side, meanwhile, the city is at the dawn of a long overdue correction to the ravaging effect of high finance.There is an element of urban legend in both positions, which, like all such histories, express an emotional if not a literal truth: New York is overpriced and horribly segregated. And it is also a city, a post-Covid hotspot, in which everyone is feeling horribly vulnerable.The crime statistics, at least for now, are a misfocus, particularly when looked at in the context of the last 30 years. In 1989, the peak of the city’s crime wave, there were 203,000 violent crimes in 2018, that had dropped to 68,000, and even in the context of what appears to be a mini-spike since 2019 – year on year, there have been roughly double the number of shootings in 2020 – compared with the bad old days, New York is still one of the safest big cities in America.You would not know this to read some of the literature online. A group called NYC Moms for Safer Streets has popped up to campaign against the homeless shelters – which seems harsh – and also to highlight that housing sex offenders within 1,000ft of a school breaks city regulations, which seems reasonable. The vested interests are strong and erse the NYPD, defensive after the protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd and in the face of campaigns to if not be defunded completely, then to be stripped of some of its extraordinary $5.58bn operating budget, has a good reason to promote the city as a place that is becoming more dangerous.And yet those cheering on the prospect of a New York in which the money moves out offer no solution to the crash in tax revenue and the knock-on effect it would have on the public school system and other services, all of which are already staggering under vast budget cuts and inadequate funding. To promote an image of the city in its broke years as a return to some romantic idyll seems completely delusional.It is the dilemma of gentrification the city has been grappling with for 20 years, brought to a head by the pandemic, and in which nostalgia for squalor and authenticity seems as falsifying as premature panic that the city is in danger of being lost and degraded if a few middle-class families move out. That day, as we crossed the street at the lights, an NYPD squad car parked opposite the subway to communicate to residents that the matter was in hand. It’s a mark of the psychological state of the city that, for different reasons, it seemed unlikely to reassure anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87bcb2f283cfcbb41f97de6852c7e8f9a35a5ed5/1033_1371_1477_887/master/1477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2bcc721d0b8747083593fc8d158e6bf","title":"postal worker lockdown low pay online","story":"Ordinary people have been lovely. But low pay and a surge in online deliveries have made me question whether I can go onMy duty begins with a long, tree-lined “dead walk”, so called at my office because there are only houses along one side of the street. Unlike the usual delivery loops, where you walk up one side of the road delivering to all the odd numbers, for instance, then cross over the road and deliver to the even numbers on the walk back to the van, dead-walking posties must return to their vans empty handed, alone with the thoughts about life, work and lockdown that busyness keeps at bay. My thoughts return to the crushing fatigue, and how much longer I can last in this job.As lockdown began in south Wales, friends and family, stuck indoors, often asked me about life outside. Knowing how hard it has been for some, I’ve been quick to say that things are great: I’m paid to be outdoors several hours a day the weather has been superb. Customers are never less than lovely: posters and messages of thanks are taped on to windows and doors, or chalked on to drives in bright colours cold drinks are left on windowsills, and kids and their parents wave from front-room windows. Friends and family joke that they wish they could be me for a day.The truth is, since lockdown started in March, my days begin with nausea. The job looks so good on paper, but the reality is barely tenable. Like many postal workers hired since privatisation and an increasing number of people in my office, I’m on a part-time contract with little to no chance of full-time hours. My annual take-home income, due to the part-time hours, is so low that I simply can’t pay the bills. Even before lockdown forced everyone indoors, causing a huge surge in online parcel deliveries, the workload was backbreaking. A colleague showed me his pedometer – he had walked 16 miles that day. Despite only being in his early 30s, he has received cortisone injections in his feet and shoulders to work through the pain. His situation is not uncommon plantar fasciitis is endemic, and I see a lot of illness, injury and burnout.Lockdown has only compounded this despite a drop in letter volumes, the enormous increase in parcels is well in excess of what we handle at Christmas. This unrelenting work stress has brought new aches and pains, as well as bouts of insomnia, depression and disordered eating. I’ve moved through the summer in a high-functioning torpor, sleepless with stress-related stomach ache, and failing to convince myself that I’m coping. After four months of breakneck pace, postal workers and managers alike are exhausted and demoralised.Before Covid-19 swept every other subject aside, all talk in my office was of the vote to strike won in January. Royal Mail Group has been dying a slow and painful death in the wake of privatisation, and the feeling on the ground has been one of uncertainty and fear of the future. To many in my office, this move – which came to an end in June – felt like a cynical ploy to undermine the universal service obligation (Royal Mail’s promise to deliver to every address in the land six days a week at a uniform price), and part of a larger scheme to sell off Parcelforce and leave the mail delivery business to rot, something the CWU fears could lead to thousands of job losses.There is a problem in this country about the kinds of work we value. In Know Your Place, one of the writers, Andrew McMillan, laments “the idea that we should all be striving toward middle-class living” as “such a narrative means that working class becomes something you’re meant to not want to be … ” This is something I was reminded of in my interview. My manager was baffled as to why I’d want to take on such a physically demanding and relatively low-paid job I have a degree from Cambridge, I read three languages, I’ve lived and worked all over the world. Surely, I’d want something “better”?And I used to. I grew up on a council estate, was the first in my family to go to university, and felt a pressure to find a job commensurate with my skills and experience. I worked hard at various white-collar jobs in my 20s and early 30s, but, in spite of the good money, I felt unchallenged, unvalued and bored senseless once the learning curve had levelled off. When I found the postie job, I wanted something simple and stable. This was so condescending in hindsight, as well as indicative of those mixed feelings about being working class, as though it would be some low-stakes day job I could coast through while I worked out what I really wanted to do with my life. In truth, the job has proved to be a lot harder and a lot more fulfilling than I could have ever expected. I’m more content, grateful and satisfied after a day’s work than I ever thought possible.This is why lockdown has been so heartbreaking. The pandemic has exposed how essential the services carried out by key workers are, and how callously the government has treated the working class at every stage of the crisis. According to data from the Office for National Statistics in May, the highest death toll has been among men in low-skilled jobs. My dad, a factory worker, returns to work in a few days. My siblings, who have screen-based jobs, will not. With the layoff of 2,000 Royal Mail managers announced in late June, as well as tens of thousands of jobs threatened at British Airways, British Gas, Rolls-Royce and a long list of household names, it’s hard to know what to expect.The roads are refilling. As social distancing is relaxed life is returning to normal, although “normal” is only that which we’ve forgotten to notice. The Thursday night applause for NHS and key workers was encouraging, but awareness is not action. Unless we protect our essential workers over the coming months, confront issues of pay, precarious contracts and working conditions, we will lose this moment of solidarity and hope for change, and the chance to reconsider the kind of country we want to live in.• Dan Bradley is a writer and Royal Mail postal worker"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab1ffac2f206bfae71fcfa52fc3cd801a2a3a6f/0_203_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349cc6d248b705b4da0ac7ba5a5ba2fb","title":"the covid funding uk theatres must do more than just allow them to survive","story":"Without the ability to create new work the sector is destined for decrepitude, stasis and irreversible declineOn 5 July the government announced a £1.57bn recovery fund to protect arts, culture and heritage from the devastating effects of coronavirus.

Survival or activity?The guidelines hint at activity but, ultimately, it’s all about survival. The argument for this is clear: if we want our cultural infrastructure to remain intact when we finally have a vaccine, it must be protected. What this financial reading has no metric for, however, is the risk of long-term inactivity and the truth that it poses as great a threat to the integrity of the industry as running out of cash reserves.Any organisation needs to derive its energy from somewhere. In the world of theatre, energy is generated by what is simply referred to as “the work”. Without the ability to create, to make, to work, the sector is destined for decrepitude, stasis and irreversible decline.For every theatre to remain inactive until the storm passes brings unconscionable risks of its own: we will lose our freelance workforce with its irreplaceable talent and skill we will lose the progress we have made on ersity and we will lose the ability to stimulate the engagement and philanthropy that is contingent upon our activity.And all of this before even talking about our audience. The emergency funding was a welcome investment of public money, a clear indication that culture is a valued part of our national life. Without it being used at least in part to generate activity, we risk being found in breach of contract with a public that will be paying the debt for years.As a wise person once said: “If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever.” If we must all wait for the return of perfect weather conditions, ours will be a ghost ship.In whatever ways we can, we need to apply our skills of adaptability, collaboration and ersification. This may be digitally, in outdoor work, in education and community practice, or in new commissions and looking at different ways to engage with our artists, our audience and our purpose.I am not ignorant of the fact that the clouds have at times darkened even in this past fortnight, with new surges in cases, local lockdowns and only today news of the stage 4 reopening dates. And while the National Theatre (NT) remains fortunate in many ways, the sheer scale of its need renders it ineligible for a rescue grant. Instead we must apply for a loan: if successful, we will be making repayments for the next 20 years.But just as essential to our survival is our ability to return to what we do. This week we are opening the stage door of the NT to a handful of artists for the first time since lockdown.Back in March we gathered to watch Rafe Spall’s blazing performance in Death of England one last time. The play, a searing analysis of Brexit, football and white working-class masculinity by Roy Williams and Clint Dyer, now has a sequel. A very English response to Black Lives Matter, Death of England: Delroy centres on a new protagonist played by Giles Terera.Until now we haven’t had clearance to perform for audiences so this first venture into a rehearsal room was for a workshop. However, in the midst of the harsh and unavoidable pain of redundancies, the decision to at least begin the process of bringing this work to the stage was an important one for the organisation.All around the country, theatres are facing agonising decisions. The security of permanent and casual staff, the upkeep of the buildings, the ability to generate activity and with it to employ freelancers: all of these intersect and compete as priorities.But I urge those at the decision-making table who are awarding funding to look favourably on those organisations with a clear intent to get making again. And I urge my peers to argue that activity is core to their survival.We found a common purpose in fighting for support. Now we must unite around a profound article of faith: that the best chance of survival is to find our way back to audiences, artists and communities. To remember that our world-beating creative industries are predicated on action, courage and creativity, and to set sail again.• Rufus Norris is director and joint chief executive of the National Theatre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e9b2e77217043666a37a099fee33b36d8f55c2/0_50_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f151bb0183d37b8625bfa6b7954f9c","title":"zaido the ancient japanese ritual to bring good luck in pictures","story":"After the death of her father and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Yukari Chikura found solace by travelling to a remote village to document the 1,300-year-old annual ceremony.

However, she has lost her place to study politics and international relations at Nottingham, a Russell Group university. “They just rejected me straight away,” she said.Students hoping to secure places at Oxford and Cambridge were also disappointed. Helen Hopper, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, said: “Sad day for us – my daughter was offered a place to read English at Oxford. Quite an achievement for a mixed-heritage person at state school. Far from being lenient, she dropped one grade in history and Oxford declined her. She was predicted an A and her coursework is A* in that subject.”Dr Daveth Frost, the principal of Holy Cross College in Bury, reported widely varying responses from universities. One student who had applied to study medicine at a university in the Midlands was holding an offer of AAA, ended up with AAB and was rejected. Frost was reluctant to name the university as the student is appealing.A second student holding a contextual offer of ABB to study medicine at Leeds University was awarded BBB and was accepted, and will be training to be a doctor from September. “In both cases they would most certainly have got much higher grades in exams,” said Frost.“Different universities are behaving in different ways. Some are being incredibly understanding. We had a student accepted for Oxford. She got a B in one subject – which she’s never done – but all her mocks were A*. She rang up Oxford and they said ‘OK we will take you’. Others I don’t think have grasped how serious the anomalies are.”An Oxford University spokesman said: “We intend to take every student who meets their offer grades as well as those where we consider there are mitigating circumstances for them missing their grade.“As we do every year when grades are re-marked, some students may be offered a deferred place. Once we reach our maximum intake of undergraduates in 2020, we will have to defer entry to 2021 for any additional candidates who appeal successfully and whose place is then confirmed.”Some school leaders reported grade requirements being lowered to allow students to take up places. William Baldwin, the principal of Brighton Hove and Sussex sixth-form college, said there were cases of students who had dropped one or two grades in the same subject still being accepted. “We are seeing evidence of universities being flexible, but within limits,” he said.Matthew Shanks, the executive principal of Education South West, a trust with four secondaries and six primaries, was one of those to report that some Russell Group universities had not been as accommodating as others.Headteachers said some universities were holding to original offers and not taking into account appeals for higher mock grades when accepting students.Bill Watkin, the chief executive of the Sixth Form College Association, said: “This is a time for flexibility and sensitivity. It will be disappointing if universities fail to demonstrate these two qualities.“There is evidence already that some universities have not shown the flexibility asked of them by the government. Some universities have already filled their places and will not wait for the outcomes of appeals, saying that even if students get the necessary grades after an appeal, they will have to defer their place until next year.”Prof Sir Anton Muscatelli, the chair of the Russell Group, said: “It is a unique and unprecedented results season and our universities are being as flexible as possible with admissions. They are taking a range of factors into account to ensure no students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are unfairly affected and can benefit from the world-class higher education offered by Russell Group universities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a042a72b270d8bc65b9bb90f8bc70e7ef6c33b65/0_135_1899_1139/master/1899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f04c6731ab7c78ef82bb8508644cba0b","title":"natures furry engineers sea otters in california estuaries surprise scientists aoe","story":"It is not just at sea that North America’s smallest marine mammals with a huge appetite are benefitting the ecosystemWhen Brent Hughes started studying the seagrass beds of Elkhorn Slough, an estuary in Monterey Bay on California’s central coast, he was surprised by what he found. In this highly polluted estuary, excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff spur the growth of algae on seagrass leaves, which kills the plants. Yet in 2010, Hughes noticed that the seagrass beds were thriving. It did not make sense.“This is the highest nutrient concentration that I had ever seen on the planet,” says Hughes, a biologist at Sonoma State University. “Any model would suggest there should be no seagrass there and yet it was expanding.”Hughes set out to solve the mystery. He examined every possible factor, including water quality, temperature and changes in seagrass coverage over time, going back 50 years. He was not making any progress until he was approached by a boat captain named Yohn Gideon who had been running wildlife tours in the slough since 1995. Over the years, the captain had handed clickers to his passengers, asking them to count the sea otters they saw.Hughes overlaid the captain’s sea otter counts with historical seagrass coverage data and realised the two graphs were almost perfectly in sync. When sea otter numbers went up, seagrass went up, too. “You don’t see that very often in ecology. That was a eureka moment,” he says.While Hughes had often encountered sea otters in the slough during his es, he never paid attention to them. Now they were clearly linked to seagrass health, but how? When the otters first moved into the slough in the 1980s, they put their big appetites to work eating crabs. With fewer crabs to prey on them, the California sea hares – a sea slug – grew larger and became more abundant. The slugs fed on the algae growing on the seagrass, leaving the leaves healthy and clean.Sea otters had already shown that they were capable of a large influence on the ecosystem. In the 1970s, biologist James Estes was conducting research in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and noticed some areas where the seafloor was covered with sea urchins. As herbivores, urchins feed on kelp, and when their numbers are not kept in check by predators, no kelp remains. In contrast, in places where sea otters were present, kelp forests were thriving. Estes demonstrated that by eating urchins, sea otters created the opportunity for kelp to flourish. Sea otters gained their official title as a keystone species. But the discovery that sea otters could also be important players in estuaries came as an ecological surprise. In fact, scientists had not even expected sea otters to survive in an estuary.Hunted to near extinction by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea otters had only survived in a few small, isolated populations in the North Pacific. Then, after the Fur Seal Treaty was signed in 1911, conservation efforts led to an increase in otter numbers. In California, the population grew from 50 in 1914 to about 3,000. On the coast of British Columbia, they were reintroduced between 1969 and 1972 and there are now about 8,100 of them.Since the otters were first recovering in kelp forests along the open coast, the scientists who studied the animals assumed that this was their primary habitat. When they started turning up in Elkhorn Slough in the 1980s, they thought that was an anomaly, failing to realise that they were in fact reoccupying old habitats.Archaeological and historical records indicate that otters were once abundant in California’s estuaries, prior to being driven to local extinction through over-hunting. “Scientists are subject to perception bias,” says Tim Tinker, a wildlife biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “Estuaries were traditionally very important to otters. But we did not really appreciate them as such. The ecological effects of otters on the outer coast dominated our thinking.”Estuaries were not even considered in the US fish and wildlife service’s plan for the recovery of the sea otter in California, listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act.Now, scientists and wildlife managers are turning to estuaries as potential places where sea otter numbers could grow. In the past decade, the expansion of sea otters on the California coast has been curbed unexpectedly by the presence of the great white sharks that are recovering from overfishing and by-catch, at the southern and northern edges of the otter range. Shark bites have become the primary source of otter mortality. “The population is constrained by a shark wall,” Tinker says.Estuaries could provide otters with an important refuge from sharks and other unfavourable coast conditions, such as storms and warming events. A recent paper suggests that San Francisco Bay, California’s largest estuary, could support about 6,000 otters, more than double the current population. “Once fully recovered, between a quarter and one third of the entire population in California could be accounted for by otters living in estuaries,” Tinker says.Scientists also believe that sea otters could be conservation allies, with their potential to help restore other polluted estuaries in California. “It is a two-way street,” Tinker says. “To have a resilient population of sea otters we may need them in estuaries but estuaries may also need sea otters.”Seagrass ecosystems like kelp perform important ecological functions. They provide nursery habitat for young fish and invertebrates, and they protect shorelines from storms and waves. They control erosion by holding down and trapping sediment. Seagrass absorbs carbon from the atmosphere and buries it in its roots, acting as a carbon sink.In south-east Alaska and British Columbia, scientists are studying other ways that otters may be beneficial to seagrass beds. “Anywhere sea otters are going, I can guarantee change is going to happen,” Hughes says.But the long-term influence of these furry ecosystem engineers is not yet fully understood.For example, when sea otters look for clams to eat, they dig in the seagrass beds, leaving holes behind. “When you are watching otters digging for clams, you can see a cloud of sediment come up to the surface,” says Erin Foster, a marine ecologist studying the interactions between otters and seagrass at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia.“It looks like a bombed-out landscape when you come across a fresh site where there has been recent digging,” adds Margot Hessing-Lewis, also a marine ecologist with the Hakai Institute.Foster and Hessing-Lewis are investigating the possibility that when sea otters disturb the sediment they could be helping seagrass become more resilient to environmental changes by making the seagrass flower more often, potentially increasing the genetic ersity of the plants.As scientists are still learning about the full impact of sea otters on different habitats, they wonder about assisting the growth of the population, especially in California where the shark predation is making it difficult for otters to expand into new areas. Elkhorn Slough was the first estuary in California recolonised by sea otters, a process that was greatly accelerated by the release in the slough of 37 otters that had been rescued and rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in the 2000s.Future otter releases could be strategically used to help sea otter populations expand in other historic habitats, though it is not always without risk. Otters could be exposed to the threat of boat strikes, oil spills, human disturbances, and contamination from chemical pollutants. The return of this top predator also comes at a cost to humans, since sea otters compete directly with shellfish fisheries which had developed in their absence. A recent study that analysed the costs and benefits linked to the reintroduction of sea otters to the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia found the benefits – including increasing fish populations, carbon sequestration and ecotourism – outweighed the losses to invertebrate fisheries by seven times.However, the benefits are not felt equally, especially among indigenous communities who rely on shellfish harvesting for food security.“Sea otter recovery is different from the recovery of any other species because they have such disproportionally big effects on the ecosystem,” Tinker says. “For most depleted species you are just worried about the conservation of the species but with sea otters, you are thinking how the entire ecosystem is going to change when they recover.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68178702f6d314ae0430fd33d22302d3ed01773f/0_370_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7c497fff9564c4c525e0b16bf42e042","title":"uk staycations countryside coast visitors trail of destruction","story":"Countryside and coastal custodians lament ‘different demographic’ of visitors leaving litter and endangering wildlifeFires caused by portable barbecues, wild flowers being dug up, the disturbance of shorebirds, and an avalanche of rubbish. These are just some of the threats to Britain’s wild places as record numbers enjoy coastal and countryside “staycations”.Beleaguered rangers complain that a new generation of holidaymakers are treating the countryside like a festival site, leaving behind tents, chairs and excrement, as well as endangering rare habitats and wildlife.“It’s like no previous law of behaviour applies,” said one warden in Devon, whosecoastal nature reserve has been the busiest he has seen it in 40 years. “Anything you would expect people to understand, such as littering or people using the countryside as a lavatory, they ignore.”Conservationists and landowners are particularly concerned by the escalating fire risk with tinderbox conditions at many beauty spots, and a surge in wild campers – or “fly-campers” – lighting fires and portable barbecues.A fire destroyed 140 acres of heathland on Chobham Common, Surrey, last weekend. During the last bank holiday weekend, more than 20 serious moorland and grassland fires devastated areas in the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales and New Forest.The British Mountaineering Council is calling for the use of disposable barbecues on open moorland to be made a criminal offence.In Dartmoor, one of the few places in England where wild camping is legal, the Dartmoor National Park Authority has deployed emergency powers to temporarily ban wild camping after a dramatic increase in “fly-camping” at Bellever, where more than 50 fire pits were dug into the moor on one night. The authorities hope the August-long ban will give the beauty spot time to recover.Craig Best, the National Trust’s countryside manager for West Yorkshire, said his team feared a big moorland fire. “We’ve got the bank holiday weekend looming and even when the moorlands are tinder-dry there’ll be every chance two or three iniduals will be having a barbecue there, and they can so easily get out of control,” he said.“It’s almost like a perfect storm,” he added, citing the combination of post-lockdown liberation, the heatwave and the long closure of household recycling centres, which caused a huge increase in fly-tipping.Problems reported by rangers include unprecedented wild camping in the Lake District huge quantities of nitrous oxide canisters discarded over Marsden Moor, close to Manchester, Leeds and Huddersfield illegal speedboating in the Ore estuary in Suffolk and huge quantities of excrement, even where toilets are open because visitors are avoiding public toilets due to coronavirus fears.The Devon coastal reserve warden, who asked to remain anonymous, said he found a family had dismantled a “dead hedge” (a feature used to provide wildlife habitat) to make a teepee, decorating it with yellow flag irises that they dug up. “They just couldn’t understand that it wasn’t acceptable,” he said.Some visitors have argued that pictures of rubbish piled up beside bins demonstrate that more bins are required, or that they need emptying more regularly. But conservationists say people should take their rubbish home.“You’re seeing the worst part of human nature and a deterioration in the habitats you’re trying to manage because you’re having to concentrate on emptying bins,” said the Devon warden.Jake Fiennes, the director of the Holkham estate, which manages England’s largest national nature reserve, said 20,000 people were visiting the estate’s beach, in the Norfolk Coast area of natural beauty, each day. Reported incidents include kites being flown where terns nest, disturbing the birds, and a resting seal pup being picked up and flung back into the water.“It’s crazy, absolutely crazy. Every day feels like an August bank holiday,” Fiennes said. “It’s a totally different demographic – north Norfolk coast visitors are usually pretty middle class but we’re not seeing the older birders anymore, we’re seeing a lot of young people. The positive is we have a chance to engage with a whole different section of society.”Fiennes said knowledge of the Countryside Code seemed to have “fallen by the wayside” among today’s young. “Shouldn’t the natural world be part of our national curriculum?” he asked.But conservationists are desperate not to appear unwelcoming to a new generation of younger, urban visitor.“We’ve got to be careful as a sector about saying you can only come into the countryside if you’ve studied the Countryside Code,” said Ben McCarthy, the National Trust’s head of nature and conservation ecology. “The long-term solution to recovering nature has to be better engagement and better experiences for the widest range of the public. There’s good evidence that once people have positive experiences in nature they start to have pro-environmental attitudes.”Nikki Williams of The Wildlife Trusts said the tension between unprecedented numbers of visitors and rare species in fragile habitats showed the importance of ensuring people had access to local nature and didn’t simply drive to beauty-spots.“You go to a place labelled ‘countryside’. It’s a visitor experience, whereas it should be integrated into our lives,” she said. “We advocate for a nature recovery network. A really important part of that is more on-your-doorstep nature. Then you start to understand more about nature and you also don’t get in the car and drive to a place that has a line drawn around it and says ‘This is where the good stuff is.’”The Wildlife Trusts are particularly concerned that the government’s new planning white paper ides the country into protected zones and areas of development and regeneration – exacerbating the idea that “nature” is an excursion to an overvisited, distant nature reserve.Nick Bruce-White, the RSPB’s regional director of southern England, said: “This interest in the outdoors and green space is something we couldn’t have wished for six months ago. I hope we can build on it. There’s a small minority of people who are doing wantonly illegal things and a bigger cohort of new visitors who, without sounding too patronising, don’t understand the basics of how to use the countryside appropriately.”Bruce-White said the RSPB, alongside the National Farmers’ Union and others, were pushing the government to include more messaging about responsible enjoyment of the countryside in its Covid-19 broadcasts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a04cc38663ea61b95fc764cfcd5aebeb7b570f/0_119_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a9a6edb7192d3de02daa68c79197a8b","title":"claire oakleys fantasy festival a dozen debut films three square meals zero popcorn","story":"The director of Make Up plans a perfect day of directors’ first movies, with food and hot chocolate to soothe your nerves between screeningsFor the past five years I’ve obsessively watched debut films.

They have given us a story that combines sentimentality and grotesqueness in a really startling way. It looks like a horror film. This Pinocchio could almost have one of the stories that Garrone dramatised in his freaky-fabular movie Tale of Tales, and the story is very different from the legendary 1940 Disney musical version – without which, admittedly, no one would care about any new remake or reinvention.Walt Disney, for example, never had Pinocchio being brutally hanged from a tree by two swindlers who wanted to rob him. But one of the interesting things about this drama is that Pinocchio – the magical wooden puppet who yearns to be a “real boy” – gains this authentic humanness by being exploited, by suffering and finally getting reborn with skin and hair. In a stable, as it happens.Pinocchio is played here with a disturbingly woodified face by child actor Federico Ielapi, and his father-creator Geppetto is played by the exuberant Roberto Benigni, who himself directed a Pinocchio film in 2002 and (a bit insufferably) played the lead. As the ageing and sad Geppetto, he is more under control, and there is something touching about his hyperactive comic persona being subdued.Entranced and inspired by a visiting puppet show, Geppetto carves one of his own, and the melancholy, poor and childless man is astonished and delighted when he comes to life. He has a son. But Geppetto’s joy is short-lived when Pinocchio is taken from him, ending up first with the marionettes of puppet master Mangiafuoco (Gigi Proietti), from whom Pinocchio gets his freedom, only to be tricked and abused by two old rogues Gatto (Rocco Papaleo) and Volpe (co-writer Ceccherini). But Pinocchio is helped by a kindly cricket (Davide Marotta) and by a fairy (Marine Vacth) and by a bizarre gorilla judge (Teco Celio), whose topsy-turvy worldview is such that he will only look kindly on Pinocchio if he claims to be a criminal.There is so much that Garrone’s Pinocchio appears to resemble: there’s a bit of Tod Browning’s Freaks (and a bit of Frankenstein), echoes of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and the Old and New Testament. The moment when Pinocchio’s nose grows because he is lying is still fascinating. It’s a parable that has taught generations of little Disney fans never to fib. Audiences for this film, however, will notice that Pinocchio’s nose does not grow when he lies to the gorilla judge. The point is that the normalisation of lying is part of the humanising process. Pinocchio’s wooden face really is very strange. It does not look like that of any sort of boy, but rather a man or woman or cyborg in early middle age. There’s more than a touch of R2D2 about him, or even a lost figure from George Franju’s Eyes Without a Face.In the end, Pinocchio is a parable of parenthood: when we have a child, there is something uncanny and strange about him or her, like a doll brought to life. In our hearts, perhaps, we can’t quite believe that this is a human being like us, who will come to have thoughts and feelings independently of us – become “real”, in fact.Next year, Guillermo del Toro is due to bring out his own version of Pinocchio and it is inevitably rumoured to be “darker”, while Robert Zemeckis has his own adaptation in mind with Tom Hanks as Geppetto, which will probably, but not necessarily, be at the other end of the brightness dial. Well, we shall have to see how they turn out, though what I like about Garrone’s adaptation is that it doesn’t put a “dark” spin on a supposedly Disney-cute story, not does it want to reinvent or reboot an assumed family-brand wholesomeness.

The midfielder’s deflected strike against Atlético Madrid with two minutes left on the clock earned his side a last-four date with PSG.It was Adams’s second appearance in the competition, having missed most of the first half of the season because of injury, but he made up for lost time with a vicious shot from 20 yards that defeated Jan Oblak after the ball struck Stefan Savic on its way towards goal.“It’s a deflection but it counts the same as a regular one,” Adams told BT Sport. “We prepared the best way possible for this game but it was a bit odd, obviously, having no fans in on a Champions League night but also coming off a three-week holiday and having to prepare for such a big game being a first game.”There will not be much time to prepare for the club’s first Champions League semi-final, with PSG awaiting on Tuesday, after their dramatic win over Atalanta on Wednesday.“Facing such a world class team like PSG, we’re excited to show what we’re capable of. We’re really, really excited. We know Paris are a great team, we saw what they did against Atalanta.“Now it’s about recovering in the right way, getting ourselves right mentally and working on the game plan. We’re confident in ourselves, you saw that.”Leipzig’s manager, Julian Nagelsmann, will need to put together a plan to stop Neymar and Kylian Mbappé but will take great spirit from keeping Atlético relatively quiet.“It was a good game. Atletico defended like in all games - very good. At the end we were better in the final third. We did not create many chances, but they didn’t create many chances,” Nagelsmann told BT Sport.“Great emotions for the club and our team. As a manager you have to look forward. We have to prepare for the next game. There’s not a lot of time to celebrate but maybe we will have a beer in the hotel then we focus on PSG.”RB Leipzig were founded in 2009, so it is an impressive feat to reach the final four. ”The club develops very fast since,” Nagelsmann said. “We reached the Bundesliga and qualified for the Champions League three times. We’re still in the Champions League. The progress is faster than usual.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7688119cd221130fe20d8ed0041218bf34864bb5/0_314_5848_3510/master/5848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b3b1472e35e350d3f103d8c377702c","title":"peace where rights arent trampled afghan womens demands ahead of taliban talks","story":"With negotiations set to begin, women have been sharing their ‘red lines’ on the progress they refuse to see negotiatedFarahnaz Forotan was three when the Taliban had arrived in Kabul. It was 1996. “I have this memory of a snowy day, I was sitting on my mother’s lap, in a minibus, and she was crying. I didn’t understand why she was crying,” Forotan says. It was the day her family became refugees.“It was the civil war, and we had to leave our home and country to live in Iran – alive, but living in pain and facing discrimination,” she says.Now Forotan, whose family returned to Afghanistan in 2001, is making sure the militants who disrupted her childhood don’t use the upcoming peace talks to roll back gains women have made.“Today, the US and the world are surrendering us to the group that still kills us every day … in our streets, in our schools and even in our homes. We have been numbed into silence, by war, violence and pain, for far too long. But now we want to shout,” says Forotan.Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government could start in Qatar this week, after the grand assembly, under pressure from the US, agreed on Sunday to release 400 militant prisoners, a Taliban condition for joining the negotiations.Many women fear that freedoms gained in the 20 years since the fall of the Taliban will be sacrificed in the talks. Just five women are included in the 21-member negotiating team.Looking away from Forotan’s camera to protect her identity, a middle-aged woman from Helmand, one of the provinces worst hit by conflict, speaks in one of the videos:“I want peace that lasts. A five-day peace is not good for me or anyone. I was whipped in public once while taking my sick child to the doctor. When I asked the man why he hit me, he told me not to leave the house without a man. My husband is disabled, I am the breadwinner of the family. How can I not leave the house? We want permanent peace in which women’s rights are not trampled.”Nagina Anwari, a software engineer, is helping with the campaign. She says the peace process scares her. “I am scared because we are represented by only a few symbolic figures negotiating a possible return of the Taliban on my behalf.”Anwari, who is from Kandahar, once the capital of the regime, says memories of the Taliban’s atrocities are still fresh.“The girl in Kabul is struggling to make ends meet and seeking equal rights, while the girl in the village stays awake all night because she can no longer go to school and must get married forcefully. Their circumstances are different so their demands are different,” she says.“Another woman who had been married three times in the same house first to her husband’s brother after he was killed, then again to the younger brother after the second one was killed. What is left of her but an empty and desolate body that was scarified to war and ignorance?” she says.But Forotan also gathered stories of strength. “I witnessed women who have gone through all these hardships and are still working tirelessly so their children can study. I was left speechless meeting girls who so boldly challenged the stereotypes of society in their male-dominated cities,” she says.Afghan women, she says, are not just worried about their own rights. “Women are worried about the order and structure that we’ve achieved so far in the last 20 years. Even if it has its shortcomings, it is worth saving. These are not feminine or masculine demands they are the general concerns among the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8f46140774a33a32654c8ba678b906763a455c/0_358_5367_3220/master/5367.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f736547b1c3d45776920c6c69ce5b753","title":"dfid scheme accused of putting uk aid in pockets of wealthy companies","story":"£6.85m programme places emphasis on benefit to businesses rather than protecting workers in the developing world, say criticsA newly announced aid programme that promises to help workers in the developing world supplying goods to British high street chains like Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Primark and Morrisons has been condemned for using taxpayers’ money to “pick up the bill” for improving workforce conditions.The £6.85m scheme, announced on Thursday by international development secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, is being promoted explicitly as benefitting British consumers to ensure they “can continue to buy affordable, high quality goods from around the world”.Trevelyan added: “This new fund will strengthen vital supply chains for UK consumers, while supporting some of the most vulnerable workers in developing countries. It will make a real difference to people in the UK and abroad.”The statement from Trevelyan, headlined UK Aid to Protect High Street Supply Chains, suggests that the partnership – which will see the UK government contribute £4.85m – is designed to “support workers in developing countries during the coronavirus pandemic and help keep some of the UK’s favourite products on high street shelves”, adding that it would benefit nearly 1 million people.The announcement of the scheme follows mounting concern over the welfare of workers who supply British companies amid the global coronavirus pandemic, which has caused slumping sales and economic hardship across the globe.Critics, however, are concerned by the framing of the programme, pointing out that the companies who will benefit already have a moral obligation to protect workers in their supply chain.The fund, which will operate in partnership with charities like Care UK, the Fairtrade Foundation and Ethical Trade Initiative, envisages helping suppliers to the high street giants in the developing world ensure workers are adequately protected from Covid-19.Companies that will benefit from the scheme include M\u0026ampS, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Morrisons, Co-op and Waitrose.The scheme will focus primarily on supply chains and workers in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda and Ghana.The new Covid-19 Vulnerable Supply Chains Facility will help to ensure the steady supply of products like vegetables, coffee and clothes to the UK high street.According to the Department for International Development (DfID) M\u0026ampS and Care will work together to improve health services for 80,000 factory workers in Bangladesh who keep the chain’s stores stocked with clothes.“The programme will strengthen community health care systems and deliver targeted health messaging in factories to help employees keep themselves and their families safe. This is expected to have knock-on benefits for a further 300,000 people in Bangladesh’s poorest communities,” a DfID press release read.Amid mounting concern over the future and direction of UK aid under Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the move was described as a “disgrace” by Labour MP Kate Osamor, a member of the Commons International Development Committee, while international poverty researcher Vidya Diwakar described elements of the scheme as unlikely to be effective.“It is a disgrace that the government is funnelling the aid budget into the pockets of wealthy businesses like Morrisons and Primark at the same time as it cuts poverty reduction programmes in some of the poorest countries on Earth,” said Osamor.She added that UK businesses “have an obligation to ensure their workers operate in safe Covid-secure environments” and said that many of the comapanies involved in the scheme “make hundreds of millions in profit each year the UK taxpayer should not be picking up the bill when they finally decide it’s time to improve conditions for their workforce.”“It is clear that Boris Johnson poses a huge threat to the UK’s status as a leader in international aid spending. Following on from the decision to scrap DfID, and then cut aid funding by £2.9bn it looks increasingly likely that the focus of UK aid in the coming years will be on commercial investment rather than alleviating poverty and hunger.”Diwakar, a researcher with the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network, while welcoming some of the commitments contained in the programme, questioned both what the announcement meant in terms of signalling for UK aid policy after DfID merges with the Foreign Office (FCO) and questioned the practicality of some measures.“I think any new programme that comes out now needs to be considered in the light of the merger with the FCO. What I think is worrying is whether this signals a new direction of where decisions underpinning aid flows is going. Whether aid programming will be seen more in terms of benefit to UK employers rather than a more principled approach.“Of course you can have self interest, but worryingly this type of programme moves the emphasis from the most vulnerable to the monetary interest of the UK.”Diwakar questioned how the scheme would help informal workers in the supply chain, including a large percentage of women, who have been shown to have been most heavily hit by the economic effects of the pandemic.A DfID spokesperson denied the money was going into the pockets of UK businesses.“UK aid is not going to British businesses. DfID’s grant funding is providing support to workers and farmers through civil society partners that are working with businesses and their supply chain.“The UK businesses are contributing their own money to the facility, which will improve the lives of nearly 1 million people in developing countries. The facility will also work with other businesses with supply chains in developing countries, not just UK firms.”Partners in the scheme praised the initiative. Peter McAllister of the Ethical Trading Initiative said his organisation “welcomed the active role DfID is playing in supporting vulnerable workers in global supply chains.“The east African agricultural workers who supply so much of our food and flowers have been hit hard by Covid-19, and DfID’s support for this intervention will help protect thousands of jobs, and protect workers from infection as the regional economy begins to recover.Fiona Sadler, head of ethical trading for M\u0026ampS added: “At M\u0026ampS we have a robust approach to ethical fashion - we know we’re only as strong as the communities where we operate and we’re committed to helping improve the lives of workers in our supply chain through collaborative initiatives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be796b117c622ef0c1213402b92eaf6174a5043a/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4be6358de8cf6f02b87a6a66ebc113b","title":"experience i helped a snail find love","story":"It is difficult for lefty snails to mate with normal snails because they have genitals on the opposite side of their headIt began when a retired scientist at the Natural History Museum in London told me that he had found a rare garden snail with a left-coiling shell. In 20 years of researching the genetics of snails at universities around the world, I had never found a “lefty” garden snail. My first thought was that this snail could be used to discover what makes most other snail shells coil clockwise. As with our previous work, in which we showed that snails and other animals may use the same genes to define left and right, perhaps the new snail might contribute to understanding human asymmetry. For example, we usually have our heart to the left, but rare iniduals are reversed.The problem was that it is very difficult for lefty snails to mate, because they not only have a reversed shell but also genitals on the opposite side of their head to normal snails. Imagine trying to shake hands with your right hand with someone who insists on using their left. It doesn’t work. How could we understand the genetics if we could not get offspring from the lefty?I kept the snail in my office at the University of Nottingham, where I am an associate professor, proudly showing it off to visitors, but not knowing what to do with it. Then I realised that we could use the media to find another lefty snail. Our press officer, Emma, convinced me that we needed a name. Jeremy immediately came to mind, after Jeremy Corbyn, because both were lefties and commonly found in the garden or allotment.We tentatively approached the science editor for BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. He wanted me and the snail in the studio the next day. I asked the public to get involved by searching hedgerows, borders and plant pots for this rare version of the common snail, asking them to email or tweet a photo using the hashtag #snaillove. Stepping out of the studio, I was barraged by telephone interviews. Global news stories followed. I also received lots of snail photos, but usually from people looking at them the wrong way around, or with cameras in selfie mode.I had been sceptical about the possible level of interest, reasoning that the public are just not that into snails. But in the end, it didn’t matter. They care about love.About a month after the first interview, I heard reports about two other lefty snails – one kept by a snail enthusiast in her bedroom in Ipswich, and another by a snail farmer and restaurateur in Mallorca. Jeremy took an unfruitful trip to Ipswich (no mating, despite interest from the other snail, Lefty).A few months later, we got the three snails together (by snail mail easily done with a small cardboard box and some dry tissue) at the university. Unfortunately, Jeremy was left shell-shocked after being given the cold shoulder by the two other suitors. “Gastropod love triangle tragedy”, read one headline the “Sexual misery of the English snail”, snarked a French paper.As the scientist meddling in this unusual love triangle, I tried to remain disinterested. But I also persisted in trying to find a match for Jeremy.There was to be a happy ending, of sorts. One Sunday, I popped into the lab and found Jeremy mating with the Spanish snail, Tomeu. Jeremy became a father, but died soon afterwards. I froze his body (to preserve the DNA) and now have his shell on my desk. There is a plan to return it to the Natural History Museum.Over three years, citizen scientists and snail farmers found about 40 more lefty snails. Together, we hatched nearly 15,000 offspring. Jeremy’s descendants were all right-coiling. The ironic conclusion (as a geneticist) was that Jeremy’s unusual coil probably originated from an accident during early development, rather than an inherited condition. Instead, his legacy was in highlighting the common links between ourselves and snails. While humans are outwardly symmetrical, internally we are asymmetric like snails, nearly always going the same way. I have been fortunate to work in Cuba, Japan and the mountains of Hawaii, all for snails, yet the snail that would change my life was found in a compost heap at the bottom of a London garden. • Do you have an experience to share?

He added that he had written to KPMG to say that HAB Housing was in no position to honour this debt and that it was open to negotiation.“Any move by HAB Land’s liquidators or others to place HAB Housing into liquidation would achieve nothing as HAB Housing has no assets,” McCloud said.He added that despite all the turmoil and crises: “I am determined that investors should see their investment as not entirely lost.”Last year was a torrid one for McCloud’s HAB (it stands for Happiness Architecture Beauty) property empire – and for the small investors who sank millions of pounds into it.In 2019 the  revealed the problems that had beset the business, including project delays, “systemic faults” and large debts.To cap it all, a HAB Housing development in Hampshire, which was supposed to have been completed in 2018, was described by locals as resembling a “bomb site”.Things reached a head in October when HAB Land and its subsidiary HAB Land Finance went into liquidation.However, HAB Housing – the flagship HAB company, of which McCloud remains the sole director – was unaffected by the liquidation proceedings.However, in August 2019 the  reported that these investors were claiming they had been “fobbed off” and had not received a penny in idends, or been allowed the opportunity to sell their shares in order to reclaim any of their investment.A year later, McCloud, 61, who has presented the Channel 4 series Grand Designs since its launch in 1999, told the investors: “There is no reasonable prospect of liquidity for your HAB Housing shares.” When shares in a business are described as liquid, it generally means they can be bought and sold quickly and easily.Brookes, who lives in Wiltshire, said after reading the email: “It doesn’t look too hopeful but at least they have got in touch and explained things.”He originally invested in HAB Housing “because I believed in what they were doing”.Brookes originally contacted the  in July to say that HAB Housing seemed to have “disappeared”. Calls to HAB Housing’s phone number were met with a message saying: “This line is not in use” and there had seemingly been little or no company activity since last autumn.However, in his email, McCloud said that while the firm was no longer occupying its premises in Bristol, “we remain open for business” and he added that he had worked over the past year to explore every opportunity to keep the company going.A HAB Housing spokesperson said future plans were “being progressed discreetly behind the scenes … During these times, the company has been operating at its most minimal and making arrangements for exciting future activity.”They added that McCloud “remains very much at the heart of HAB Housing as a director and as the largest shareholder, and has been actively involved in driving forward development of future plans. Kevin continues to believe in and uphold HAB Housing’s vision about creating sustainable, beautiful homes and thriving communities, and is moving the business forwards to deliver that with greater effect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2209648c1c203d9971562c0d0c4ffa96d00294/0_228_5457_3273/master/5457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e291ca5ebedbea3aafd3638c97d886ef","title":"a post pandemic guide for retailers think of your customers as your biggest fans","story":"Lockdown has shown us that people will support the brands they want to succeed – a business expert’s advice to store ownersThe retail sector has been in flux for some time and, post coronavirus, there’s more uncertainty to come.“There is a lot of talk about ‘returning to normal’ or of the ‘new normal’, but prior to the pandemic the only normal was that everything was changing,” says business consultant Neil Gibb. The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

A huge drop in sales during March seemed to sound the death knell for at least some sectors of the industry. Online sales, on the other hand, have rocketed and new approaches are emerging among those retailers that are learning to be agile.“Covid-19 has really accelerated a bunch of inevitables. A lot of things are just happening a lot faster,” says Steve Hewett, global vice president for retail customer experience at the tech and consultancy firm Capgemini.For many companies, online is exploding. “This was already happening,” says Hewett. “But some companies are achieving the sort of online growth in weeks that they expected in three or four years.”This has implications for how companies do business, and it’s likely to be crucial to be able to deliver a hybrid onlineoffline experience to the post-Covid-19 customer. Here are five trends currently reshaping the retail sector:Brands are getting chattierIt seems that customers engaged with brands more during lockdown. “For years, buying something meant going to a physical place, seeing the branding in the store and understanding who that brand is,” says Adrian McDermott, president of products at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “We need to establish the digital equivalents of finding, meeting and having those conversations.”Prices could remain “sticky”Rajesh Bhargave, a consumer behaviour expert, suggests that retailers need to be wary of changing their prices – whether up or down. “Consumers tend to remember what they paid previously and would view price increases as unjust in poor economic conditions.”Dropping prices is not always the answer either. Many consumers will have taken a financial hit and their wallets will be closed for concessionary spending. A knee-jerk reaction might be to cut prices to bring back that demand but, says Bhargave, associate professor of marketing at Imperial College Business School in London, this could have negative long-term effects and erode pricing power: “If you’ve been paying £10 for a meal and suddenly that’s £8 you start to wonder about the quality of the meal.”Brands have to add valueInstead of dropping prices, brands are likely to start looking at different ways to add value, says Bhargave. “If people want to dine at restaurants, they might want a more private and safe experience,” he says. “So how can you start offering a different service that charges a higher price and offers better value?”Video calling is another area that business is only starting to explore. “With so much taking place on Zoom, is there a higher-end service you can provide in this area?” Selfridges, for example, is offering online beauty and styling appointments, with products then delivered to customers at home.This is part of a move towards getting more revenue from fewer people, and appointments for in-store shopping also fall into this category. “It’s all part of offering a more customised, high-end experience,” says Bhargave.To bring the joy back into shopping, some stores are putting their energies into their window displays to encourage browsing and others are providing queue entertainment.The need for a new kind of agilityThings may never be the same. “We’ve almost got to hit the reset button,” says Hewett. “People are returning to school and the office and there’s no playbook on what the wants and needs are.” Moreover, whatever they are could change dramatically again. Hewett adds: “There’s an organisational need for agility that wasn’t there before, as brands aren’t able to be as tactical as they would like.”Things are changing fast. But you can be faster.

Despite government support, having to close their doors for months had a crippling effect on many and forced them to take action to keep afloat.For Steve Sanderson, founder of the independent menswear retailer Oi Polloi, lockdown pressed fast forward on an already tough situation for small businesses. The company’s store in Manchester has always been at its heart, but it also has a strong online and social presence. “Bricks and mortar operations are really difficult,” he says. “What’s going on at the moment is sort of a super fast wormhole journey into the future.”Sanderson says that things are going to be particularly tough for fashion stores, with an inevitable drop in footfall, plus the issues of being Covid-19-secure, such as being unable to let customers try on clothes unless the items are quarantined or cleaned afterwards. “If people can’t try things on, why would they come in to a clothes shop?” he asks.There are, though, some rays of hope. “We have a good connection with customers through our bricks and mortar business, and certain people will always like that. But we can’t afford to just be open – we have to find a way of making it work.“We’ll have to adapt and become something else, something people can’t get from anywhere else. I like the idea of click and collect because you can do something quite interesting with that. You could then also narrow down the time the store itself is open.”For Michelle Drew, co-founder of Established 25 Atelier, which sells fashion and home accessories, the coronavirus crisis forced her to reassess her ambitions. Before lockdown, Drew, who started in 2017 making scarves and bags for friends and family, was selling at a quarterly design market in Greenwich and had a monthly stall at Spitalfields market. When Covid-19 brought things grinding to a halt, her first thought was that she needed to get her website up and running, and really engage online. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says.Since then, Drew has joined online workshops and used the time to rethink her plans. “Previously, I thought I’d love to collaborate with other designers and have a premises. I’m now wondering if that’s the way forward, because so much has changed and I’m not sure things will ever be the same.”While Drew plans to return to physical selling at some point, she sees her business relying more on online trading. “It’s still a precarious situation. I definitely will return to the markets because I enjoy the contact, but I’m looking at other ways to move the business forward.”Bigger retailers, too, have faced challenges, for all their greater resources. Some have come through with flying colours, though, particularly if they had the right technology to hand.For Tesco, the coronavirus crisis brought an unprecedented surge in demand, but the company was well placed to react quickly. It already had emergency plans in place thanks to a “doomsday” management exercise four years ago. It had also embraced remote working, and had the technology to handle communication with 460,000 staff, suppliers, people services and security operations. These systems allowed the company to double its capacity for delivery and click and collect in just six weeks. Improvements to the computer algorithms used to drive picking technology – plus the army of pickers hired to cope with the increased demand – mean that whatever the future brings, the chain appears to have the flexibility to deal with it.Similarly, the online flower delivery company Bloom \u0026amp Wild proved its resilience. For its founder Aron Gelbard, protecting jobs by staying open was important, as was providing people with a way of showing they care for the loved ones they couldn’t see in lockdown.With its tailored CRM system, which manages queries from a range of channels, Bloom \u0026amp Wild now employs more than 25 customer service agents who manage between 3,000 and 3,500 inquiries every week – rising dramatically during peak times such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day and, undoubtedly, lockdown.The company uses Zendesk to manage its customer relationships, allowing agents to deal with inquiries across Twitter, email, phone, online chat, Facebook Messenger and SMS. Alongside this, analytics help the company forecast customer demand and plan for peaks.As a business that exists purely in the virtual world, it’s an example to retailers everywhere of what can be achieved by clever use of technology.Things are changing fast.

McGill was four frames ahead overnight but won five of the 16 played on Thursday to leave himself with an uphill battle.Wilson had stormed back in the morning session to win six of the eight frames and level at 8-8 but if McGill was stunned by the one-sided nature of that session he did not show it. In the evening he was on course for a 147 until he missed the seventh red into the corner. McGill still won the frame comfortably but a missed black in the next allowed Wilson to make a decisive 99 break, with only a failed yellow denying him his third century of the match.Two tight frames were exchanged in which Wilson rediscovered his free-flowing style before the interval with a break of 116, giving him the lead for the first time. Wilson extended his advantage in the next frame and, as McGill continued to struggle, another century break – this time 105 – put the Englishman 13-10 ahead.McGill might have been facing a sleepless night over the way his fortunes had fallen so dramatically, but he regathered his composure to produce his first Crucible hundred this year – a superb effort of 136."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50b89a72edceba2fa4684297d368b6db7401292/156_237_2311_1387/master/2311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bead125e45836b624c15dbbcb29bba4","title":"england v pakistan second test day two","story":"46th over: Pakistan 126-5 (Babar 25, Rizwan 4) Mohammad Rizwan plays out the last two balls of the over.The players are out on the field, and live sport is upon us.

Had everything going for him and after Edgbaston 2015 and that tour of South Africa mentioned, looked like he had all the issues (read run up) behind him. Then the next thing you know, he played his last Test for England aged 27.”Before Jofra, I hadn’t seen an England bowler with as much potential – not even Steve Harmison. I suspect that ultimately Finn had too keen a mind for his own good. (This may also be Jos Buttler’s problem as a Test batsman.) There was a terrific chat with Finn during the lunch break of one of the South Africa Tests – he spoke about his career like he was his own biographer, with such insight and a complete lack of bitterness, frustration or self-pity.If he is so inclined, he will write a genuinely great autobiography, partly for the same reasons that he didn’t become the great bowler we all hoped. (I realise 125 Test wickets at 30 and 102 ODI wickets at 29 is still darn good, and puts him 227 up on the rest of us. But a lot of us thought he would take at least 300 in each format.)“You do know that there are still some purists out there, short-form deniers, who only acknowledge Test match cricket as worthy of their time and of having value?” says Ian Copestake. “Twenty-what? OD-who? It’s five-dayers or nothing for this bunch. A pretty tight crew.”Copestake, I’ve warned you before not to talk about this thing in public.“In other news,” writes Ali Martin at the Ageas Bowl, “Jofra currently has the keeping gloves on (second day running).”“There is another, very important, Jimmy stat looming on the horizon,” says Chris Drew. “A thousand wickets in first-class cricket. He’s currently on 967. Not many players in modern times will achieve that total.”Especially if they are a seamer. I’m not sure who the last was, maybe Andy Caddick in 2005. A few spinners have achieved it since then. Lunch is at 1.30pm and I don’t know what else to tell you.Batter v batsman “Also,” says Graeme Thorn, “‘batter’ introduces some symmetry - the other playing roles on the field are fielder, (wicket)-keeper and bowler, you don’t say ‘bowlsman’, ‘wicket-keepsman’ or ‘fieldsman’ very often, if at all.”That’s a good email. Good enough, in fact, that I’ll forgive all those double quote marks I had to edit.“Good morning RA Smyth,” says James Debens. “Some cricketers are revealed to be mortals. I’d just watched Alan Igglesden bowl very well v Yorkshire (taking the wickets of Michael Vaughan and David Byas), only to watch in horror as he executed a 33-point turn in the car park of the Mote Park ground. Richie Richardson, in comparison, made an effortlessly smooth exit. Things were never the same for me after that summer of 1994, but at least I had Winnie by my side. “PS Winnie being my Winfield jotter.”That’s a great story, I can picture it now, Iggy strugg- HANG ON, HE KNOWS MY MIDDLE INITIAL!“As a kid, I used to the hold the bat by swapping my top and bottom hand,” says Damian Clarke. “No one in the colts or school picked up on it until until I joined Maidenhead and Bray at the age of about ten. In an early nets assessment session, a certain Michael Parkinson came over and asked just what the hell did I think I was playing at, and made me change my method. I thought he was very rude, but it did seem to work better, so begrudging respect was due, I suppose.” I wish this was on YouTube.“When did they all become batters?” says Anthony Farmer. “It’s not baseball.”There’s this new thing in society called ‘women’, I don’t know whether you’ve heard of them. (For what it’s worth, I still use ‘batsmen’ most of the time in men’s games, but surely you can understand why many people say ‘batter’.)“Steve Pye (11.07am) mentioned the Oval Test of 1995,” says Stephen Bickers. “Looking at the scoreboard, I see that three England players reached the 90s, but none of them made a century. Is that a record for players falling short in one Test match?”Yep, though it’s shared with a few other teams, including West Indies in Trinidad in 1934-35 and Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in 2018-19.“In James Taylor’s all too brief England career he was brilliant at short leg,” says Graham Pierce. “He pulled off an absolutely belting catch there to dismiss Hashim Amla from a proper shot. It was such a shame he lost the chance to cement a position in the team and set the standard for close in fielding like that.”He really was terrific. That South Africa tour of 2015-16 was sadly a false dawn for a few players: Taylor, Nick Compton, Steve Finn (who bowled magnificently) and even Trevor Bayliss as a Test coach.“It is possible for a right-hander to bat with his left hand below his right,” says Steve Hudson. “In the 1980s I played against a mid-Wales side that included a No 4 who did exactly that. He had played for the County side too, they said. It took some time to get used to the quirkiness of this. Anything (and I mean anything) pitched outside off stump was smashed along the carpet for four. After a while we realised that anything on leg stump left him completely strokeless. We stuck it there and he duly holed out.”I’m trying to practise it now, admittedly with a coat hanger, and it just feels weird. I think I’ve put my back out, too, and I was only trying to steer it to third man for one. “I cannot believe Blur v Oasis was 25 years ago!” says Julie Wilson. “The year I went to Glastonbury where Oasis were playing and the year I got married!”Time flies when you’r- wait, hang on.It has stopped raining and the clean-up operation is under way. There will be an inspection at 11.50am. In the meantime, I’m off to grab a coffee.“Not a slip or short leg, and not England, but Jonty Rhodes was clearly picked for his fielding - certainly in ODIs,” says Zadok Prescott. “His batting average was fairly... average, about 35 - but he would regularly add 15-20 runs saved with ridiculous stops - and batsmen certainly grew less likely to sneak a single anywhere near his backward point region. On top of the fielding runs he contributed - he would regularly pick up one or two wickets a match that were not really meant to be out with any other mere mortal fielding at backward point, either caught or run out. I’ve never seen a more pro-active fielder, he seemed to anticipate shots in his area and start moving before the batsmen completed the stroke, enabling him to make an extra few metres to make a runs save, catch or run-out.”I’m not sure I agree that he was clearly picked for his fielding, even though he was outrageously good. I think he falls into the same category as Derek Randall - that if a selection was 5050, maybe 4555, he would get the nod. You could argue that because his fielding was so good he was slightly underappreciated as a batsman, certainly during his peak years in the late 1990s and early 2000s.“Why do people think that one rare excellent innings by Buttler, after an embarrassingly bad time keeping wicket, makes it the right to cement his place as wicketkeeper?” says Richard Smith. “He leaks runs behind the stumps, when he is up to the wicket for a spinner the ball invariably bounces off of him and he has no idea of stumping! For me the wicketkeeper has the only truly specialist fielding position and should have the best available ‘keeper’ in place.”Whether you like it or not – and I think I might just know the answer – the role nowadays is batsmanwicketkeeper, not the other way round. It’s not going to change, so we might as well accept it and all send hate mail to Adam Gilchrist for vandalising culture with his genius. “It seems worth adding that England should never have the same wicketkeeper for all three formats,” says Tim Sanders. “This hasn’t been a problem so far because everyone got a rest in the spring, and then we had separate Test and ODI ‘bubbles’. But if the intention is to go back to how it was from 2014-2015, when Buttler kept wicket in Tests, ODIs and T20s, that would seem a mistake given the usual scheduling. I remember Buttler had to miss a few games with fatigue during that time. As a long-term admirer of Jonny, I feel a little sad to lean the opposite way to Vic Marks and I am trying to be less curmudgeonly when Jos does well.”I think this extended break is a good thing for Bairstow, who for his last 18 months in the Test match was repeatedly running head-first into a brick wall and telling everyone he was fine, he didn’t feel a thing. I wish he would help himself, though – his latest plan to bat No3 and keep wicket for Yorkshire is entirely ludicrous. For such a no-nonsense cricketer, he doesn’t half make some senseless decisions. But when he does get back in the Test team, as I suspect he will at some stage before the Ashes, I’d expect his batting form to be a lot closer to his 2016-17 best.“I am cheered that the world has come round to my way of thinking with your confirmation that 35 is the new 40,” says Ian Copestake. “I do however live in an even braver new world in which 51 is the new 35. Join us.”“With regards to John Starbuck’s email, last year the Australians were swooning about Bancroft’s close catching to the point it made one think that’s the reason he played,” says Digvijay Yadav. “In fairness, he was brilliant there. And I see that you let Hameed’s mention slide without a comment. I am sure there is a player there and one that’ll make it.” “Hi Rob,” says Steve Pye. “Staying on the nostalgic path that Gavin Monks strolled down, on this day in 1995 Mike Watkinson’s 82 not out helped England draw the fifth Test at Trent Bridge, and I dared to dream that England could beat the West Indies in a series. The pitch at the Oval didn’t really encourage a decisive result, though.”I vividly remember driving home from work with my mum on the Friday afternoon of that Oval Test, listening to the radio as England posted an imposing 454, trying to get my head round the fact they were probably going to win a Test series against West Indies. Over the next 48 hours, West Indies scored the best part of 700. Is it any wonder I turned out like this?Here’s Iain Mott on the subject of batting stances. “I’m sure there was a Pakistan batsman, maybe in the 1970s, who played with his LEFT hand BELOW his right. Can anyone remember this?” It was Wasim Raja. And all the other left-handers. But this is crap banter and you should ignore me, as you clearly meant a right-hander. I can’t think of anyone - surely that would be impossible? Even Paul Collingwood would deem such a grip to be a bit over the top (hand). “We’re all hoping and waiting for Jimmy to reach 600 Test wickets,” says Lorraine Reese, “but am I the only one thinking it would please the number geeks (of which I am one) if he got to 613?”Ooh, good spot. If he finishes on 613 Test wickets it will be the second greatest stat involving an England cricketer. “We really ought to be hearing that the England coaching staff are prioritising close catching training, including analyses of position, stance and reactivity,” says John Starbuck. “Catches have always gone down at times and doubtless more will do so, but giving yourself an extra edge by having tip-top slips and other really close fielders should be imperative. On which note, I saw Haseeb Hameed take a couple of snorters at very short square in Notts’s last match. Has anyone ever been sackedbrought in for their close catching alone?”Alan Oakman wasn’t picked for his ability at short square leg during the 1956 Ashes – but it helped. Derek Randall might have edged a 5050 selection because of his fielding, though I don’t know of any examples on record. And though close catching isn’t the reason for his immortality, it would be remiss to post this entry without using the words Gary and Pratt.Twenty-five years ago today, two of Britain’s most popular pop groups released singles. Thanks to Gavin Monks for this particular nostalgic rush.“Morning Rob,” says John. “Am I alone in thinking that despite his innings to help win the match last time out - for which Buttler DOES deserve to have kept his place - he had another really poor day behind the stumps yesterday? He was moving back when Burns shelled the slip catch and should have been in place to take that, plus he failed to stop two or three down the leg side. Maybe I’m being unfair, but I guess I’ve just run out of patience, and I would bet money that he will never get his batting average up to 40. He’s just not good enough.”I can see all three sides of this debate. I was strongly in favour of Buttler’s recall in 2018, and he batted really well for the first year. His innings the other day was extraordinary, too. He’s in a strange position in that, if all three contenders are in top form, Bairstow is the best batsman and Foakes the best keeper. But Buttler has unique ability and last Saturday couldshould empower him so much. The keeping doesn’t bother me as much as it probably should, especially when the ball is wobbling, though it will probably cost England in Asia. I thought Foakes was treated appallingly last year, but at this precise moment in time I think Buttler deserves to keep his place. The only certainty is that we will be having this conversation in one form or another in pretty much every Test for the next 3-4 years. And it’ll become even more complicated when Bairstow rams 327 off 307 balls for Yorkshire this week. (Incidentally, I think an average of 40 is a red herring. Batting has become so difficult in Test cricket - the toughest I can remember since the mid-90s - that 35 is the new 40. If Buttler averages 35, pulls off the occasional miracle victory and keeps competently, I think England will be very happy. But my gut feeling is that, come the first Test in Brisbane in 15 months’ time, Bairstow will be keeping and batting No7.) It’s grim down south, and I’d be surprised if we get any play before lunch.England don’t really draw Test matches any more: just five in the last 50 and two in the last 29, stats that deserves their own Cliff Richard song. But if they want to maintain a mood of result positivity over the next few days, they could face a race against time. Thunderstorms and bad light meant only 45.4 overs were possible on the first day at the Ageas Bowl, with Pakistan struggling to 126 for five against some challenging bowling. The forecast is equally moody for the rest of the match.The good news is that, when the players are on the field, the game should rattle along at a decent pace. There was swing and seam for the England bowlers yesterday, so Mohammad Abbas in particular should enjoy himself when the time comes. Might be today, might be tomorrow it’s beyond our control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d550e17b45a8adca4b7fef00d16fd8e1a7e15116/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb109012a44569c1efe5183784c11f0","title":"joe biden campaign donations kamala harris","story":"Boost in donations, seen as a sign of momentum brought on by Harris, comes after Biden lagged behind Trump in July fundraisingJoe Biden’s Democratic presidential campaign raised $26m in the 24-hour period after he announced that Kamala Harris, the California senator, will be his running mate, a huge boost in funding for the ticket.The amount was seen as a sign of strength and momentum behind Biden’s campaign brought on by Harris’ arrival. Donald Trump’s fundraising in July topped Biden’s by nearly $30m, bringing in a total of $165m compared with Biden’s $140m, but the former vice-president is closing the gap.During a virtual grassroots fundraiser, Biden said that 150,000 donors were first-time contributors. “It’s really palpable, the excitement, because there’s so much at stake,” he said.The fundraiser immediately followed Biden and Harris’ first joint campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, where the candidates said Trump had left the US “in tatters” because of his failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout.“We have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him,” Harris said, in her first speech as the vice-presidential nominee.“He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground,” she said.If they prevail in November, Biden and Harris are likely to inherit a country still reeling from the pandemic that the Trump administration has failed to contain. Young protesters are demanding sweeping change to political and economic power as well as a governing agenda that addresses systemic racism, the climate crisis and economic inequality.The pair were briefed by public health experts on the coronavirus crisis on Thursday.The president’s campaign has launched a scattershot assault on Harris, attacking her as “radical” and leftwing, even though progressives in her party view her as more moderate. On Wednesday, Trump used his press briefing to attack Harris with language that nodded to America’s pejorative “angry Black woman” stereotype.On Thursday he followed with a series of sexist attacks against Harris, calling her a “mad woman” and “extraordinarily nasty” when referring to her questioning of Trump’s intensely controversial US supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing in 2018.In an interview with Fox Business’s Maria Bartiromo on Thursday, Trump referred to Harris as “the angriest of the group” of Democrats who ran for president. Though she had initially been seen as a strong contender, Harris dropped out of the race in December.Earlier on Thursday morning, Trump tweeted that the media had given Harris a “free pass” saying there was “nobody meaner or more condescending” to Biden during the primaries.Trump’s tirade on Fox Business also included the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying that she “is not even a smart person” and that she “goes out and yaps”. Trump also described the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, as “stone-cold crazy”.Biden had struggled to keep pace with his Democratic rivals in fundraising during the primary race but quickly grew his finance operation for the general election. Harris is known as a successful fundraiser, and already helped raise millions of dollars for the Biden campaign before she was named as his running mate.Harris will deliver her much-anticipated speech for the Democratic national convention next week at the Chase Center in Wilmington. The convention has been totally upended by the coronavirus pandemic. It has been dramatically scaled back and is to be held almost entirely virtually, with speakers such as Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Obamas slated to make appearances. Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday night.The national conventions are usually some of the main events of the presidential election, marking the official end of the primaries and gearing the party toward the general election.Lauren Gambino contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9bbc779d75f85d9e51ead86f86c7cd9f4ccf1c/0_4_3010_1805/master/3010.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec0a01ab3762dac229e9459c091ae18a","title":"kamala harris california senate seat democrats","story":"Speculation has already begun as to who might be appointed by Gavin Newsom – and several contenders are in the runningJust hours after Joe Biden announced Kamala Harris as his running mate, in her home state of California fierce speculation had already begun as to who might replace her in the Senate if she wins a spot in the White House.“It seems early,” said Aimee Allison, who heads She the People, a national network seeking to elevate women of color to political leadership. “But behind the scenes, conversations are already happening. And I don’t think it’s too soon to think about what the community wants, and what the state wants in a leader.”If the Biden-Harris team wins on 3 November, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, will appoint someone to replace Harris in the Senate for the duration of her term, which ends in 2022. Asked on Wednesday if people have already started pitching themselves for the position, Newsom joked with a reporter: “You may be the only one who hasn’t – unless you just did.” Later, he added that his comment was only a “slight” exaggeration.Everyone has their favorites, but Allison believes Newsom should not replace a woman with a man. “It’s just a bad look,” she said. “And after the protests inspired by George Floyd’s murder – to me it makes sense to have someone of color.”“Kamala Harris has a very important and significant voice and perspective in the Senate, just because of who she is,” said Nathan Barankin, Harris’s former chief of staff and a long time California political strategist. “That’ll certainly weigh on the governor in evaluating his options.”Here are a few of the top contenders.The 43-year-old Democrat has emerged as a progressive, populist voice despite representing California’s ultra-wealthy 17th district, where tech giants including Apple, Yahoo and Intel are headquartered. He served as national chair of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, and is co-leading California’s delegation to the Democratic national convention this month. Describing himself as “a pro-growth progressive”, Khanna is viewed as someone who can unite Sanders’ leftwing supporters and moderate Democrats.A progressive icon and memorably the sole Congress member to vote against authorization of use of force following the 911 attacks, Lee has long advocated for police reform and criminal justice reform. The 74-year-old Oakland representative has also introduced legislation to create a racial healing commission amid the nationwide reckoning on racism and police violence. Serving in her 12th term in Congress, Lee is deeply established on Capitol Hill.Schiff’s profile rose this year due to his leading role in the Trump impeachment hearings. Schiff has lots of support in California, and he’s a top fundraiser. But as the head of the House intelligence committee, Schiff may wield more power if he stays in Congress rather than shifting to the Senate. That he is a 60-year-old white man also makes him an unlikely choice to replace Harris, who broke barriers as the only the second African American woman and the first south Asian American to serve in the Senate.The Los Angeles congresswoman emerged as a top contender in the veepstakes. In California, Bass has built a reputation as progressive and a pragmatist – a community organizer who fought police brutality and addiction in Los Angeles and a practical politician who helped dig the state out of a historic fiscal crisis in 2008. The chair of the Congressional Black Caucus is “someone who can heal our country – not just from the pandemic, but also from the racial isions, the economic isions”, the legendary labor organizer Dolores Huerta told the . Though her past comments on Fidel Castro raised concerns that she would alienate Cuban expats, 66-year-old Bass maintains strong support in her home state.His efforts to increase voter turnout across the state, and his strong rebukes of Trump’s baseless attacks on mail-in voting, have earned Padilla national acclaim. A longtime friend and political supporter of Newsom, if appointed, Padilla, 47, would make history as the first Latino to represent the state in the Senate. Unlike all the congressional members who might be considered for the role, Padilla has already won a statewide election.Becerra, who succeeded Harris as California attorney general, could also succeed her as senator. He has served 25 years in Congress as a representative from LA, and his national profile has grown as attorney general due to the state’s numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, including its efforts to roll back environmental regulations, revoke the state’s ability to set its own car pollution standards, and rescind protections for undocumented immigrants. The son of immigrants from Mexico, Becerra, 62, would also make history as California’s first Latino senator. But as the state reckons with its racist policing system, his reluctance to shift investigations of police shootings to statewide agencies has come under criticism.She’s not well known outside California, but as the first Black legislator to chair the state’s budget and fiscal review committee, Mitchell gained popularity in her state and respect in Sacramento for negotiating two state budgets. Having held state-level office, Mitchell is now running for a seat on the LA county board of supervisors – but progressive political groups have also floated her as a contender for US senator. Whoever Newsom appoints as senator, Mitchell told the Los Angeles Times she’d like to see a woman succeed Harris, because women tend to elevate issues such as childcare, affordable housing and workers’ rights.Favored by progressives, Durazo made a lasting impact on Los Angeles politics as a labor leader, long before she was elected state senator in 2018. The 67-year-old is not well known nationally, or even within California – but her decades of activism on behalf of workers and immigrants, and her stint as the first woman to head the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor have earned her a strong base in LA and support from liberal political leaders statewide.This is far from a definitive list – political strategists have also floated California’s lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, US congresswoman Katie Porter and the California controller, Betty Yee, as qualified candidates for the Senate. “The biggest problem that the governor will have is the embarrassment of riches,” Barankin said. “To choose between all these qualified candidates is going to be very difficult.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4404687dfd9c6715391c520db52d1bc64290da33/0_141_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=997a887b4c7c084900faa9cc39abc17e","title":"water shutoffs moratoriums end coronavirus","story":"Water shutoffs threaten basic anti-viral hygiene as debts mount amid the pandemic’s economic falloutMillions of families in America risk losing running water over unpaid bills as moratoriums on shutoffs expire across the country despite record levels of unemployment and mounting fatalities from the coronavirus pandemic.Running water had been guaranteed to about two-thirds of Americans as hundreds of utilities suspended disconnections amid warnings from public health experts that good hygiene, particularly hand-washing, was crucial to curtailing the devastating spread of the coronavirus.But now at least 115 local moratoriums on water disconnections, including the statewide orders in Indiana and Ohio, have expired. That leaves 46 million or so people at risk of having their taps turned off even as the pandemic rages.Another 21 million people will lose the guarantee of running water by 1 September, according to analysis by the not-for-profit group Food and Water Watch (FWW), as numerous orders are slated to expire, including statewide moratoriums in Wisconsin and Maryland.Nationwide, more than 5.2 million people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the US, leading to at least 165,000 deaths – the worst per-capita death toll in the world.Yet, federal lawmakers have ignored calls from advocates to guarantee access to running water until the end of the pandemic by issuing a national moratorium on shutoffs, as well as providing financial aid for struggling utilities.“Our country is in crisis, people are hurting and our leaders are failing us. No one should have to worry about being denied water because they have fallen behind on their bills – especially amid a global pandemic. Congress urgently needs to pass a relief package that puts people first and stops all utility shutoffs across the country,” said Mary Grant from FWW.Access to clean, affordable running water was already a major problem before the pandemic, as record-breaking price hikes had plunged millions of Americans into water poverty.The full extent of America’s water debt is unknown, but a recent investigation by Circle of Blue, a water research organization, found that 1.1m households in 12 large cities owe a total of about $1.1bn to their water departments.Yet targeted safety nets to protect Americans from destitution such as the $600-a-week enhanced federal unemployment benefit and a moratorium on evictions have expired. The Senate has adjourned until 8 September without agreeing a new stimulus deal.Brandon Dennison, a self-employed general contractor from Thurman in Gallia county, Ohio, stopped working in March when the state went into lockdown. He filed for unemployment in June, only then realising he was eligible, and received this first cheque in early August.“We didn’t go hungry because we get food stamps, but we only made it as long as we did because I picked up a job with a neighbor and the moratorium on energy and water bills,” said Dennison, 29, who lives with his partner Ashley, 30, and six children, aged 10 and younger.On 20 July the taps were turned off – without warning, for unpaid bills totaling about $200. Dennison was unaware that Ohio had rescinded the water moratorium 10 days earlier.Officials made the decision in June – a day after Ohio’s health director, Dr Amy Acton, quit amid pressure to roll back public health measures and reopen for business. Cases soon rose sharply and while they have since plateaued, Ohio currently has more than 104,200 confirmed cases and 3,734 deaths, according to the New York Times database.The Dennison family was reconnected after Ashley’s parents lent them money to cover the bill and reconnection fee. Gallia County Rural Water Association did not respond.They currently owe $4,000 to the electricity company, and that moratorium ends next month. Dennison is looking for construction work in surrounding cities, and if he gets a contract, will probably stay away from home to protect the family from infection.“I’m absolutely worried about the pandemic, it’s so stressful thinking about the kids, but I need to find work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551f9ac151cf3f94db3f0226425cc52f2dac98ab/0_603_3002_1801/master/3002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ecceb0d5e62774d2599bf2b76fd2233","title":"nearly 300 workers test positive at ms sandwich factory in northampton","story":"Greencore started testing staff after local rise in coronavirus casesAlmost 300 workers have tested positive for coronavirus following an outbreak at a factory in Northampton that makes M\u0026ampS sandwiches.Greencore said some of its staff are self-isolating after a significant number tested positive for coronavirus. The company took the decision to proactively test workers as a result of a rise in cases in the town.A spokeswoman for Northamptonshire county council said 79 people returned positive NHS tests and a further 213 tested positive through Greencore’s private testing.In a statement, Greencore said: “As a result of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Northampton area, we took the decision to start proactively testing all of the colleagues at our Northampton site. We can confirm that a number of colleagues have tested positive for the virus and are now self-isolating.“We are liaising closely with PHE East Midlands, Northamptonshire county council and Northampton borough council, who are fully supportive of the controls that we have on site.”Greencore said in each case the company has conducted contact tracing and instructed potentially affected colleagues to self-isolate.The company added: “All of Greencore’s sites have wide-ranging social distancing measures, stringent hygiene procedures and regular temperature checking in place, and we are doing everything that we can to keep our people safe.“As ever, the health and wellbeing of our colleagues is our number one priority.”Lucy Wightman, director of public health at Northamptonshire county council, said employees have been asked to “act now” after the number of confirmed cases in the town increased from 66 in the week ending 2 August to 85 for the week ending 9 August.The outbreak in a factory in Northampton follows a similar outbreak at an Asda-owned meat processing site in West Yorkshire, where 165 employees contracted the virus in June. reported that more than 450 workers at four food factories across England and Wales had tested positive for coronavirus in June. Health officials had been closely monitoring clusters of new cases linked to food processing plants following similar outbreaks in France and the US. In the US, as many as 25,000 meat and poultry workers are reported to have contracted Covid-19, with at least 93 deaths.Northamptonshire county council said it has been working with colleagues at Greencore following the Covid-19 outbreak and that Public Health England Midlands has been providing support.Wightman added: “This has been supplemented by support from the local infection prevention and control team and Northampton borough council’s environmental health colleagues. It is evident that Greencore has highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace.“Northampton borough has been experiencing a high number of cases over the last four weeks and residents and employees have been asked to ‘act now’ to follow additional measures, to avoid a local lockdown or further government intervention.”Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, said: “We have been concerned about Greencore.

The changes were postponed from 1 August.The following businesses and activities can reopen in England, provided they follow Covid-19 secure guidelines:The changes only apply to England – the devolved authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own restrictions. Many activities, such as bowling alleys in Wales or close-contact facial treatments in Scotland, were already reopened in areas of the UK with lower coronavirus transmission rates than in England.The new rules in England also do not apply where local lockdowns are in place, which currently includes areas in the north of England, Leicester and Luton. You can check whether your area has local restrictions on the government website.The government says you are still NOT allowed to:Nightclubs, dance halls and sexual entertainment venues will remain closed.The advice, when you leave your home, is still to avoid being face-to-face with people from outside your household, to frequently wash your hands with soap and water, and to avoid crowded places.Government advice remains that it is important to maintain social distancing from people you do not live with. Single adult households – adults who live alone or with dependent children only – can form an exclusive support bubble with one other household. You should not change or add to your support bubble once formed.Face coverings are mandatory on public transport, in shops, museums, galleries, cinemas, places of worship and public libraries. There are some exemptions to the face covering rule, for example if you are a child under 11 or someone with a physical or mental disability that would make wearing a mask difficult.The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Travel is permitted throughout the country, but you are advised to try to maintain social distancing as much as possible while doing so, especially in confined spaces such as a car.International travel is subject to restrictions. You must self-isolate for 14 days when you arrive in the UK, unless you have travelled from one of the countries where there are “travel corridors”. There are currently 76 countries and territories on the list, which should be checked before you travel.Since 1 August those considered clinically vulnerable to the coronavirus, due to a pre-existing condition such as cancer or a respiratory condition such as asthma, are no longer required to shield indoors. There are exceptions to this in local lockdown areas.If you have symptoms of the coronavirus – which include a fever, a new persistent cough, and changes to your sense of taste andor smell – you can book an NHS coronavirus test online.In general, the advice remains that the more people you have interactions with, the more chance the virus has to spread. Therefore, try to limit the number of people you see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c97a42cffa4d3855dee9417f7066b63e470094ab/0_187_4143_2486/master/4143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4427d3a7ddfe6528d45a87389664301","title":"government quietly drops 13m covid tests from england tally","story":"Exclusive: Double counting raises fresh questions about accuracy of testing figuresThe government has quietly removed 1.3m coronavirus tests from its data because of double counting, raising fresh questions about the accuracy of the testing figures.An update on the page read: “An adjustment of -1,308,071 has been made to the historic data for the ‘tests made available’ metric. The adjustments have been made as a result of more accurate data collection and reporting processes recently being adopted within pillar 2.”The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the changes affected data reported between 14 May and 12 August. It said there had been “a double-counting of test kits that had been dispatched”, “which had not been removed from the lab’s processed data”.The changes were made after it was discovered fewer in-person pillar 2 tests had been carried out than originally reported, while more tests had been sent to NHS trusts and care homes. The problem was acknowledged by the DHSC on 6 July but the tests were removed from the data on 12 August.Pillar 2 tests involve all testing done outside hospitals through commercial companies. For example, swab tests carried out at satellite testing centres, such as care homes, and home swab testing kits delivered by post.Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, said the data on testing had been “shambolic” for months.“To now retrospectively adjust the testing figures by 1.3m overnight – without explanation – is the latest in a long line of chaotic failings by the government on testing,” he said.“How can we be confident that testing and tracing is working properly when basic data on the number of tests is obviously so flawed? Ministers need to get a grip of this as a matter of urgency.”The government has previously been reprimanded for misleading the public with its testing figures. Concerns were raised after a target of 100,000 tests per day was met by adding thousands of mail-out tests to the country’s testing capacity figures at the end of April.In a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, in June, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, said: “The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding.” The Liberal Democrat health, wellbeing and social care spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: “With so many families torn apart by this pandemic, the government must recognise the fall in public trust in their handling of the crisis.“To avoid questions of fiddling the numbers, they must be explicitly transparent in how they have changed the data and how they will rapidly build testing capacity.“Ultimately, we need an immediate independent inquiry so lessons can be learned more systematically.”The revised test count comes after up to 750,000 unused coronavirus testing kits manufactured by the diagnostics company Randox were recalled from care homes and iniduals because of concerns about safety standards.The recall was ordered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the UK government instructed care homes and members of the public to immediately stop using Randox testing kits in mid-July amid concerns over their sterility.Allyson Pollock, a clinical professor of public health at Newcastle University, said: “The government needs to make clear what they mean by an adjustment and why the change has taken place. There are also big questions that should be asked about the Randox contract, and the one with Deloitte is still not published, we should really press for that.”A DHSC spokesperson said: “In July we became aware of an overcounting issue which we publicly and transparently acknowledged and have since sought to clarify these figures subsequently.“This does not change the fact that we have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history, with over 13 million tests delivered, and capacity to test 300,000 every day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8759aaa9ac0c708726aaf3f65d16bcc9830f4242/0_84_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f00f73a56761ad22aad5c4ff4916549","title":"second time unlucky covid restrictions derail japan pms holiday again","story":"Shinzo Abe had planned to visit family during O-bon holiday but political rival Tokyo mayor calls on capital’s residents to stay home Millions of people who have been forced to cancel holidays due to the coronavirus outbreak might struggle to sympathise, but Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is among those forced to forego his summer break – and he has a political rival to blame.Abe, who has been criticised for his handling of a recent rise in Covid-19 infections, was reportedly due to return to his constituency in Yamaguchi prefecture this week as Japan began several days of public holidays.But he was forced to put his vacation on hold after the governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, called on residents not to leave the capital during the O-bon holiday, when people traditionally return to their home towns to visit family and pay their respects to their ancestors.Abe had planned to visit his family grave and attend a fireworks display, according to Jiji news agency.Japanese authorities do not have the legal powers to impose travel bans, but Abe would have drawn fresh criticism of his response to the outbreak had he taken a holiday when so many people have decided to stay at home.Abe had been planning to visit his holiday home in Yamanashi prefecture during a four-day weekend in July, only to cancel after Koike called on Tokyo’s 13.9 million residents to avoid non-essential travel outside the city amid a resurgence in cases.Koike, who has been tipped as a future prime minister, is “always interrupting” Abe’s holiday plans, Jiji quoted a prime ministerial aide as saying.It remains to be seen if Abe will go ahead with plans to visit his holiday home after Japan marks the 75th anniversary of its defeat in the second world war on Saturday.“The prime minister is exhausted by a barrage of criticism,” an aide told Jiji.An LDP lawmaker told the news agency that the sight of Abe, whose health has been the subject of speculation in recent weeks, taking a “luxurious vacation” in the middle of a pandemic “could provoke a backlash from the people”.Japan has avoided the large number of deaths and cases seen in the US, Britain and other countries, but it is struggling to contain a rise in new infections in Tokyo and other areas since Abe lifted the state of emergency in late May.Tokyo reported 206 cases on Thursday, bringing its total to 16,680, according to public broadcaster NHK. Japan has so far reported a total of 53,315 Covid-19 cases and 1,090 deaths, it added. The figures include those connected to the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which was quarantined in Yokohama in February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa23d45e4813e3a585bdc005e1d70e7860eb19b3/330_437_4877_2926/master/4877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7e42e4095cf6cf4b631ee37fc71c130","title":"beirut explosion devastates sursock palace and museum in pictures","story":"Among the many homes and buildings damaged by the Beirut explosion were the Sursock Palace and Museum.

Photograph: Bloomberg There have been 92 further cases of Covid-19 identified in the State, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported on Thursday, but there have been no further deaths here from the disease. The latest figures bring the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic to 26,929.There has been a total of 1,774 Covid-19-related deaths here.Dr Ronan Glynn, acting chief medical officer at the Department of Health, appealed to those living under renewed coronavirus restrictions in counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly to “hold firm”, although he said cases are also occurring in several other counties around the country.“We expected that this week the daily figures we report would rise and fall,” he said. “NPHET is closely monitoring all trends, patterns and changes in the data, including not just case numbers but locations, age groups, and sources of transmission. “This is still about a united, whole-of-country approach. The only way we can effectively suppress Covid-19 across Ireland in the long term is if we act together to protect each other.”The newly reported cases include 43 men and 48 women, with 72 per cent of them under the age of 45. Of the new cases, 43 are associated with existing outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case. Twelve have been identified as community transmissions. The geographical breakdown by county is 24 cases in Dublin and also in Kildare eight in Limerick six in Carlow six in Kilkenny five in Meath, and five in Clare. A combined further 14 cases have been identified in Cork, Donegal, Kerry, Laois, Louth, Monaghan, Offaly, Waterford and Wicklow.“Living with Covid-19 has undoubtedly been difficult and this pandemic has adversely impacted on people in many different ways. We know that what the public health advice asks you to do can be difficult, but we are asking you to stay the course with it,” Dr Glynn said. On Wednesday, NPHET said the reproduction rate of the virus had fallen this week from 1.8 to 1.6, and reported a slight drop in new cases to 40. However, Prof Philip Nolan of NPHET’s modelling advisory group had said that despite that trend Ireland is still experiencing a sharp and worrying increase in the spread of the virus.Northern IrelandEight new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Northern Ireland on Thursday, bringing the total number of cases there to 6,225.The North’s Department of Health also said there had been no new deaths from the virus notified on Thursday. The department’s total figure for deaths from the disease in the North remains at 557.According to the most recent data, there are three confirmed cases of people with the virus now in intensive care beds in hospitals in Northern Ireland. There are also three active outbreaks of Covid-19 in care homes there. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 180 such outbreaks.Earlier on Thursday, Northern Ireland’s Public Health Agency said data showed clusters of the virus occurring in several districts.An analysis of all cases across Northern Ireland showed that since the start of contact tracing on May 24th a total of 11 clusters with five or more people have been identified. These were in Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council (one cluster), Ards and North Down Borough Council (1), Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council (1), Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council (1), Mid and East Antrim Borough Council (3), and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council (4).In addition, there were 20 clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people. A cluster is defined as two or more confirmed cases among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a 14-day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tResidents waiting outside their home on Berkeley Road, Dublin on Wednesday evening following their eviction. Six people have since gone back into the house. Photograph Nick BradshawThe The majority of tenants who were evicted from a property they were renting in Phibsborough, north Dublin returned to the home on Thursday. Nine tenants, many of whom are foreign nationals, were removed from the Berkeley Road property on Wednesday morning. Several men wearing all black, face coverings, caps and sunglasses entered the house on Wednesday morning, instructed the tenants inside to leave and then boarded up the front door and windows. A number of gardaí attended the eviction and watched from the street outside the front door, as one of the tenants was physically removed from the property, according to video footage.The tenants spent several hours afterwards outside the house, with their belongings and bin bags full of clothes on the pavement. On Thursday, activists with the Dublin Central Housing Action group removed the boarding and allowed the tenants to re-enter the property. The housing group was previously involved in several high-profile occupations of vacant Dublin city properties in 2018, to protest the housing crisis. The tenants claim they had not been served written eviction notices to vacate the property prior to it being repossessed on Wednesday. Six of the tenants were back inside the property on Thursday. Upon re-entering the home tenants said significant damage had been caused inside the property, including windows, doors and toilets being broken, with bed mattresses in the house also removed. Gerry Ward, who had earlier been the tenant’s landlord, said he had been involved with the property since around 2004. He said there was a legal dispute over it since 2017 with a property fund, Beltany Property Finance.“That has not been finally resolved, that has not been fully resolved,” he said, adding he had not been aware of the property’s repossession until he was contacted by the tenants.ConfidentialityA spokesman for Goldman Sachs, which controls Beltany, said the fund had sold the property on June 2nd, but was unable to disclose the name of the buyer citing confidentiality reasons. One source said the property had been sold to a Dublin-based company. Two iniduals listed as directors of that company did not return requests for comment on Thursday.KBC Bank had owned the loan on the property previously, but sold it to Beltany around two years ago, a KBC spokeswoman said. A number of the housing activists assisted tenants in cleaning the property, as well as supplying new mattresses, installing a new toilet and replacing the front door on Thursday. Elias Niyi Adbo Jegede (47) is one of the tenants, who came to Ireland from Nigeria in 2005, and had been living in the home for several years. “What happened here is someone that has lived here for several years was evicted within 10 minutes . . . I don’t see how this is happening in Ireland,” he said. Speaking after tenants re-occupied the home on Thursday he said: “I am very grateful for the Irish people who have helped us.” The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) has written to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris querying the presence of gardaí at the eviction. The civil rights organisation stated gardaí should not be playing any supportive role in property evictions, unless it was in response to criminal behaviour. ‘Chaos’Another tenant, Theresa Chimamkpam (45), said she had been living in the house since 2011, and had not been served an eviction notice to vacate the home. “This is our home, in the middle of the pandemic you threw us on the road,” she said. Ms Chimamkpam said the property was in a “state of chaos” when the tenants returned on Thursday. Emergency accommodation was sourced for a number of the tenants on Wednesday night by a voluntary group, Inner City Helping Homeless.A Garda spokesman said legal representatives of the property’s owner attended Mountjoy Garda station on Wednesday, “to inform gardaí that they intended to secure their premises”. Gardaí “noted the proposed activity but did not attend the premises at the time”, he said. During the eviction a tenant made an emergency call to gardaí at 11am, and a number of units attended the scene, but “the majority were quickly stood down”, the spokesman said. “Subsequently a number of Garda personnel remained at the scene with the primary function to prevent breaches of the peace and ensure the safety of all persons involved,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Covid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Countries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

The Democratic candidate for the White House wears the years with a heaviness that is not lost even on his enthusiasts. While he never rules out a second term, this self-avowed “bridge” to the next generation implies just the one. With its lack of travel and live events, this Covid-19 election campaign, The Campaign That Isn’t, has spared him. The grandest public office in the world will not.Kamala Harris is, then, in line to be as much co-president as vice-president of the US. In the senator for California, Biden has hired not just a running mate but an executive burden-sharer and – forgive the macabre note – a viable stand-in. Given Biden’s taste for foreign affairs, she might have space to impose herself on the domestic realm in particular. Her potential influence is vast.It is also ambiguous. Biden has chosen Harris, yes, but which one? Disaffected Republicans will hope for the tenacious prosecutor with the Third Way patter. “It’s not progressive to be soft on crime,” she said, running for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. As California’s attorney-general, she confronted the parents of truant children more zealously than she did the state’s draconian justice system.Progressives, for their part, will expect the other Harris. This is the one who opposed the death penalty earlier than many in her party and votes well to the left in the Senate. She was the untiring scourge of Republican nominees and witnesses in that chamber.There is no disgrace in inconsistency: give me an opportunist over an ideologue. Whether he actually said it or not, John Maynard Keynes’s airy line, “When the facts change, I change my mind”, is too stifling. People’s views can evolve even where the facts do not.It is just that Harris is such a pronounced case. A 55-year-old political lifer – she has never worked in the private sector – should have some definition by now. “Enigma” is the euphemism for someone whose core beliefs are so up in the air. Were she bidding to be a ceremonial vice-president, a less maladroit Dan Quayle, we need not worry. If elected, however, she is going to matter. And therefore so do her views.Presidential campaignLooking back, it is odd that such a fancied candidate did not do better in her own presidential campaign. She was a major politician from a state with a larger economy than that of most G20 countries (and all the donors that implies). She was of mixed race in a party that draws much of its support from minorities. Her Senate performances suggested not just ruthlessness but guile.In the end, what she did not have was perceived authenticity. In fact, every candidate in the Democratic primaries who had made a late-career turn to the left, namely senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, flopped. Voters preferred the real thing (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) or an unabashed moderate like the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg. Policies mattered less than the conviction with which they were espoused.Biden ran some way to the left of his former self, but then he already commanded trust. Personal tragedy and almost 50 years in public life will do that. He had “earned” the right to stick a licked finger in the air and sense the wind’s direction.Of course, the national electorate is not the Democratic base. And had Biden named Warren or an untested mayor this week, President Donald Trump might be high-fiving campaign aides. The Biden-Harris pairing is far more daunting.Just not, in part thanks to that vagueness of hers, unbeatable. In a reptilian passage of Tony Blair’s chatty memoirs, the former UK prime minister explains how to go about negative campaigning. The classic error, he says, with the sureness of the thrice-elected, is the lurid, over-the-top attack. Swing voters learn to tune these out. What moves them is the lesser charge, expressed more in sorrow than in anger.UncertaintyTrump will never persuade Americans that Biden is a menace to the republic and “against God”. The criticism that might land is that he is too old and weak to run his presidency. Other forces will end up dominating. If one of them is a protean vice-president, a crime-hawk until she wasn’t, with changeable healthcare plans, the uncertainty is doubled. Caveat emptor.“Look, I like Joe,” a canny president might say. “But do you really know what you’re getting?” It would insinuate that Harris is an agent of the far left, but then blank canvases are there to be painted on. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dithering britain denial eu turkey geopolitical time bomb","story":"President Macron’s lightning visit to Lebanon after the Beirut explosion highlighted France’s increasingly active interventions around the Mediterranean. Yet few policymakers here seem to have taken on board the risk of a geopolitical explosion at sea between France and Turkey.The two estranged NATO allies are jousting for influence and energy resources from Libya to Cyprus. France is sending out warships and fighters as the war of words between President Macron and his Turkish bête noire, Recep Erdogan, intensifies.France is backing Greece and Cyprus with a show of force as Turkish warships escort a Turkish drilling ship into waters claimed by the two EU states. That Turkish exploration vessel is named in honour of the great Ottoman pirate and slaver, Oruc Reis, whose rampages ranged as far as the French coast from his Algerian base. The symbolism of its name is obvious. High summer ought to be holiday season around the Mediterranean but the buzzing of fighter jets increasingly disturbing.Our Foreign Office provides travel advisories for danger zones, but its advice about Greek islands in the frontline in sight of the Turkish coast is about the marginal risk of Covid-19 not war. If Whitehall had given travel advice in August 1914, it probably wouldn’t have noticed the unusually busy trains on German railways heading towards Belgium. Post-Brexit Britain has its own problems with France over cross-Channel illegal migration, but President Macron is showing how an independent foreign policy might look.Don’t let President Macron’s rhetoric about defending the European Union’s borders and sovereignty mislead you. The reality is that Greece and Cyprus are looking to France as a great power ally. The rest of the EU maybe good for a statement of support and even a threat of sanctions but when it comes to possible use of force only France counts. Paris has military power. Brussels has words. Britain still has two sovereign bases on Cyprus which is in the eye of the storm. Turkish troops still occupy the northern half of the island. Ankara remembers  the crisis of 1974 when Turkey intervened in Cyprus. Britain remained passive despite being a guarantor of Cyprus and its constitution.That was at the low point of our post-war decline. Yet today, Harold Wilson rather than Margaret Thatcher, let alone Winston Churchill, seems to be the guiding spirit of British policy towards the gathering storm in the Eastern Mediterranean. British expats and tourists in Cyprus might continue to enjoy a quiet life if the tensions lift, but there is little sign that London is alert to the risks to them and our military there.Nonchalance in a crisis can be an impressive pose, but the lassitude gripping British foreign policy this mid-summer is a symptom of a deeper confusion in Whitehall about what this country’s role should be around the world post-Brexit. It is not a conscious retreat to a “Little England” outlook. That would be a policy. Instead passivity seems a substitute for knowing what Britain wants and how it can achieve that. President Macron may be stretching France’s resources thin but he is purposeful.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greens force tour de france change starting point","story":"Green municipal councillors in Brittany have blocked a plan for the Tour de France to start from the city of Rennes next year on the grounds that it would damage the local environment.The Greens have long been enamoured of environmentally-friendly bicycles, but they are up in arms over what Jean-Marie Goater, a Rennes councillor, described as the  “disastrous environmental impact and waste management” of the world’s most famous cycle race.The Tour’s organisers have been forced to change the route  and start the race in another Brittany city, Brest.Valérie Faucheux, co-president of a group of Green councillors in Rennes, said: “This race has had its time but now run its course and it’s struggling to reinvent itself.”Mr Goater urged cycling fans to rediscover the virtues of the sport “far from the race, where money is king, with its sponsoring, TV business and doping”. The Greens, riding high after local election victories in several French cities in June, are determined to prove they can make a difference. But their opposition to the Tour, which attracts a huge international following and is a source of pride for many French people, has exposed them to attack.Bernard Hinault, a national icon as the last French winner of the race in 1985, said Ms Faucheux’s attitude made him angry. “You can’t say cycling is a thing of the past. It’s ridiculous,” said Mr Hinault, himself a Breton. “I think she should think before opening her mouth.”   A local news website, Rennes Infos Autrement, described Mr Goater as “green with rage”.However, it is not the first time that a local authority has refused to host a stage of the Tour. In 2018, the Right-wing mayors of Garches and Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, informed the race organisers that hosting it would be too disturbing and not beneficial for their local communities. Last year Grenoble’s Green mayor, Eric Piolle, refused to host the first stage of the race.This year, the coronavirus pandemic has forced organisers to delay the Tour, which is to start on August 29.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oldham brink full lockdown coronavirus cases surge","story":"Katrina Stephens, the director of public health for Oldham Council, said a full lockdown could take place in days rather than weeks unless people adhered to rules.Mr Burnham said a full lockdown should only be considered when everything else has been tried first, adding: To go from where we are today to full lockdown, that would present serious difficulties for the public but also for Greater Manchester services as well.He confirmed he had written to Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, alongside the Manchester City Council leader, Sir Richard Leese, to set out his concerns.Speaking during a weekly press briefing, he said: We need to see the pubs, particularly, implementing the measures, capturing people\u0027s names and addresses, so we can then make sure that the test and trace system is working as well as it should do.He also said he would be writing to the major supermarkets to call for a stricter approach to enforcing the wearing of face coverings in stores.There have been 70 confirmed cases in the region in the past week, and council leader Jonathan Nunn said the situation could go either way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers accused submitting implausibly high predicted grades","story":"The exam regulator has accused teachers of submitting implausibly high predicted grades amid a growing fall-out over A-level results day.On Thursday, official data revealed that close to 40 per cent of results in England were downgraded from teachers\u0027 predictions (see graphic below), prompting students to complain that they had been let down by the system.But the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) said that, while the vast majority of teachers had submitted accurate estimates to exam boards, some had put forward wildly inflated grades.Because the circumstances meant there was no opportunity to develop a common approach to grading, the standard applied by different schools and colleges varies greatly, a spokesman for the regulator said.A rare few centres put in implausibly high judgments, including one which submitted all A* and A grades for students in two subjects, where previously there had been normal distribution.The intervention came amid a growing row on A-level results day, with pupils and schools complaining that they had been unreasonably punished by the statistical mechanism used to calculate grades. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, came under pressure to follow Scotland, where grades created by an algorithm were withdrawn and teachers\u0027 predicted results will take their place. Mr Williamson faced calls to address the huge injustice for this year\u0027s pupils from Labour as well as headteachers after results showed that poorer pupils in England were more likely to have their marks downgraded by the algorithm. Universities promised to be flexible and hold open places for students while they appeal against their grades, with many desperate to fill courses as overseas students fail to take up places. Sources close to Mr Williamson insisted there would be no U-turn and said the model used was the fairest in the circumstances (see video below). They pointed to Ofqual figures which showed that almost twice as many pupils would be awarded A*s than in previous years if teachers\u0027 optimistic grades had been allowed to stand.Do teachers really think this year\u0027s cohort at the top end is nearly twice as bright as previous years? It just doesn\u0027t stack up, one source said. It is the most blatant demonstration that teachers are not to be trusted on grading. Some is optimism – some is just playing the system.This year\u0027s grades were calculated using a statistical model which took into account pupils\u0027 past performance and their school\u0027s historic grades, combined with the rank order drawn up by teachers, after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus.A Government source said: There are always people who do not get their predicted grades. People seem to be operating with the notion that everyone should just get what their teachers think they should have got.Pointing to the grade inflation that resulted from teachers being left to predict results elsewhere, the source added: The whole point is to avoid what has happened in Scotland and France. No one will trust the Scottish 2020 results. Another said: It\u0027s a matter of downgrading versus undermining.Sources highlighted figures from the university admissions service which showed that 79 per cent of students accepted to university last year did not meet their predicted grades.On Thursday night, Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools, intervened, saying: We have to minimise the amount of extra unfairness created. Standardising grades, with a right of appeal, is an important part of the jigsaw.Not to do so would be unfair for last year\u0027s school and college leavers and next year\u0027s, who are competing for jobs, training and higher education places.Headteachers called for an urgent review into the statistical model, with some claiming it may even be systematically biased against disadvantaged children who were more likely to have had their results downgraded.A former minister said: He\u0027s clearly seen the chaos in Scotland and is trying to move to prevent that scenario. Instead he\u0027s just made himself look panicky and incompetent. In short, he\u0027s justifying his own sacking.A third backbencher added: It\u0027s a farce, it\u0027s a disgrace, and Gavin Williamson should hang his head in shame and resign. He was a useless Defence Secretary and even worse Education Secretary.However, allies of Mr Williamson said on Thursday night that he had the support of Boris Johnson, hitting out at rival MPs\u0027 briefings. One said: As a former Chief Whip, he\u0027ll always have some enemies.Data published by Ofqual showed that students from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to benefit from a boost in grades than those from more deprived families (see graphic below).While A*s and As rose by 4.7 per cent at fee-paying institutions from last year, they only rose by two per cent at comprehensives, 1.7 per cent at academies and 1.2 per cent at grammars.Meanwhile, pupils classified as being of lower socio-economic status were more likely to have their grades downgraded from their teachers\u0027 predictions. One in 10 teenagers from this group had their A-level marks lowered, compared to eight per cent of pupils of higher socio-economic status, Ofqual\u0027s data revealed.Mr Johnson said the exam results published on Thursday were robust and dependable. He congratulated students on their results, adding: I think that there\u0027s a record number of candidates, of students, who are able to get their first choice course at the university of their choice.Plus, there\u0027s a record number of students, of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds who now, as a result of these grades, will be able to go to university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"went aab dae missed place university unfair system","story":"Top students across the country opened their results today in a state of shock - expecting A*s, As and Bs after two years of hard work, they found they had been \u0027downgraded\u0027 to Cs, Ds and Es.Teachers had to explain to their brightest pupils that they had been judged partly on the basis of what last year\u0027s class achieved, rather than just on the quality of their work or how hard they revised for their mock exams.Maks Ovnik has achieved a string of As and Bs throughout his time in sixth form, including in his mock exams for Mathematics, Physics and Computing, and was predicted to get AAB.But the 18-year-old opened his results to find he achieved a D in Computing, an A in Mathematics and an E in Physics, meaning all hope of taking up his place at Southampton University was lost.Mr Ovnik believes it is because his school, Christ the King College on the Isle of Wight, recently came out of special measures, and those in the cohort above him scored poorly on their exams last year.He told The : The majority of my class were high performing in physics this year and last year the cohort was low performing which has affected it.After a long stretch in lockdown unable to see his friends or go to school, he is now likely condemned to take a year out so he can resit his exams in the autumn.The student explained: I am also going to try and appeal my grades because going down three grades in two subjects is a bit ridiculous.The teachers feel awful about it but obviously it isn\u0027t their fault. I am hoping the government sees how many people this is happening to.He believes that he would have performed even more highly in the exams than in his mocks, in which he scored AAB, as he had spent four months diligently studying.  Delilah Lees was hoping to change the world by studying robotics engineering in order to help disabled people and the environment. Predicted AAB in Maths, Physics and Computer Science, and having been studying every day, she was confident she would get the grades, as were her teachers.However, come results day, she was shocked to lose her place at Bath university and be given ABD by the algorithm. Her mother, Amanda, said she was devastated.This is particularly upsetting for the family as Delilah had overcome many hurdles to achieve good grades at school. Developing anorexia after suffering bullying, she taught herself from her hospital bed during her GCSEs and achieved straight As. This gave her the confidence to take on six placements in her summer holidays, including one at TfL, and she has given speeches on artificial intelligence.Amanda Lees told The :  We rang them first thing and told them we were appealing. We have spoken to the school and they are writing to Bath today to put her case. She really does have a special case after spending so much time out of school and working so hard.It seems that while schools are horrified and very supportive, our experience so far is that we are completely confused.Her school, Goldolphin and Laytmer in Hammersmith, is going to try to appeal all the grades en masse after facing large numbers of downgrading.Mrs Lees explained: She has the grit and determination and tenacity and a brilliant mind and she wants to do good with her degree. After covid we need people like Delilah.They are not looking at inidual cases. They are looking at algorithms and crunching numbers.   It\u0027s brutal because this is their future. She has been remarkable, she studied every day during lockdown just in case she needed to. She\u0027s taken online Stanford university course, all the things that could help her in her first year she\u0027s already covered the material. It\u0027s a phenomenal waste of an amazing brain.  She\u0027s achieved in spite of everything. She\u0027s never asked for special consideration.Hannah Gofton was given lower grades than she had ever achieved in an exam because she was deemed to be from a deprived area.The teenager missed out on her place at the University of Nottingham after receiving BBB, despite being predicted AAA and achieving AAB in her mocks.She told The : I have been completely downgraded on my grades and cannot get into my firm university.The University of Nottingham will not accept me considering they gave me a contextual offer and I can’t get in touch with anyone at the university to explain my situation.I come from what is classed as a ‘deprived’ area as my college is in Hartlepool (English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College).I just want some recognition for this issue as my future is now completely ruined.Thomas Kinsella was ready to go and study Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Durham University until he was given results lower than his mocks.A straight-A student, he was predicted A*AA. However, the teenager from Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire was given ABB.He told The : The school have told me that they don’t think an appeal is viable in my position and I will have to re-sit. I have phoned Durham and they say there is no way for them to accept my re-sit grades when I get them and I will have to do a full reapplication.I got ABB in Maths, French and Physics having been given A*AA CAGs by my teachers. Just by chance my three subjects happened to be significantly stronger this year than they were for the last 3 years at my school. I assume therefore my grades and ranking didn’t fit the distribution assigned to my school by the algorithm.I have now missed out on my offers to go to Durham or Exeter. I have been strong academically  throughout my time at school (11 A*s at GCSE) and feel like had I sat my A Levels I would have done far better, but instead have been caught out by a poorly made algorithm that relies too much on past data for something as complicated to predict as education.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 14th august 2020","story":"King\u0027s College Head Gardener Steven Coghill is assisted by gardeners from other colleges as he battles the inclement weather to complete his wildflower baling.Over the course of the last few months, the famous Back Lawn at King\u0027s has been transformed into a wildflower meadow covered in poppies, cornflowers and oxeye daisies, stretching from the Chapel to the river.

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People on social media were quick to praise Parton for speaking out.“Between Dolly Parton’s quiet Covid research fund, BLM support, and her sending generations of children books through the USPS, at 74, she continues to be one of the most relevant and ever timely people of every era,” wrote one Twitter user.Parton was also described as a “national treasure,” and an “American treasure”, while someone else described Parton as “one incredible American”.Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt wrote: “Me: I couldn’t love @DollyParton more.

Reports say that Oxfordshire Fire Service put the fire out and that nobody was injured.The costly stunt is thought to have been six weeks in the making, with a source admitting: “Unfortunately, it was miscalculated.”Subtitles for ‘inaudible’ Avengers scene may reference X-Men characterIs Tenet a sequel to Inception? Farfetched theory explainedTimothy Dalton: ‘Why do we need to offer people gratuitous sex?’They continued: “The heat and the friction of the tyres meant that when the bike crashed, the cardboard padding sparked and went up in flames.”According to reports, Cruise is “frustrated” by the delay, with the inside calling the situation “a catastrophe”.The Independent has contacted Paramount Pictures for comment.Earlier this month, the sequel – which is being directed by Christopher McQuarrie – found itself in deep water after it was reported the film’s crew is pushing to blow up a bridge in Poland that is considered a national monument by locals.Part of the disused bridge, which is situated in the village of Pilchowice, would be detonated for the stunt.However, crew members are facing obstruction from local citizens despite Deputy Culture Minister Pawel Lewandowsk claiming that the bridge has no cultural value.Production on Mission: Impossible 7, which will be directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is set to resume in the UK in September, before heading to Poland in April.The film will be released in November 2022.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that although survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) appeared to show a drop in how many people were infectious, from one in 1,500 to one in 1,900, “there’s huge uncertainty about each of those estimates”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe added: “If you want to take a positive view, that’s a small improvement. From a scientific point of view, I think we would probably conclude that it’s not changed very much.” Other epidemiological indicators suggested a similarly small degree of change, he said.From Saturday, beauty parlours and other close-contact services, soft play areas, casinos and indoor performance venues can reopen following a delay caused by a spike in cases.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOf the decision to further ease lockdown, Prof Edmunds said: “I don’t think it’s really been taken on epidemiological grounds, I think it’s really been taken primarily for economic reasons, and there’s of course extremely good reasons for doing that.”Asked if he feared England was moving too quickly, he added: “Again those are political decisions. I think you have to balance the epidemiology with the economics and other considerations. I think all of us would prefer there to be much lower numbers of infections but the government has to balance these things out.”Later in the programme Grant Shapps insisted that ministers had taken their decision based on science, and denied it was done for solely economic reasons.The transport secretary told Today: ”We decide this based on what the Office for National Statistics say about it and they’d expressed concerns about a slight increase in England’s test-positives, and you’ll recall that we put on hold the measures which, as you mentioned, are now coming into place.“They’ve now suggested that that situation has levelled off so, again, just looking at the pure data, we’ve said OK.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Economists predicted, however, that the next set of figures would see an economic resurgence.Delve members wrote: “A tight lockdown that is released too quickly or too fully would probably lead to adverse outcomes in terms of both lives and livelihoods.“To be precise, too quickly or too fully here means relaxing the lockdown without sufficient regard for the state of the pandemic, the capacity of the health care system, and epidemiological markers such as the effective reproduction number.“The rationale is simple. An abrupt and premature lockdown exit would lead to a second wave of infections that would bring with it both a higher death toll and additional costs for the economy.“One reason to believe that the economic consequences of such a strategy would probably be dire is the evidence that perceptions about risk of infection lead to voluntary physical distancing, so that a second wave would lead to falling economic activity even in the absence of a renewed lockdown.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The US and eurozone have both already been confirmed as being in recession.There were signs of a recovery beginning, as monthly gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 8.7 per cent in June but is 17.2 per cent below February 2020 levels, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain faces up to the prospect of mass unemploymentSurvey results showed that businesses are increasing output as demand has risen following the easing of social distancing and lockdown measures.Manufacturing, construction and services all experienced widespread growth in June as businesses were allowed to resume trading, but output in all three sectors remained significantly below pre-pandemic levels.The output of service industries remains 17.6 per cent below the level of February, after growing by 7.7 per cent in June.Manufacturing remains 14.2 per cent below February levels after growing by 11 per cent since May.Construction saw the biggest fall in output and the sharpest rebound. It expanded 23.5 per cent in June as sites reopened but output is 24.8 per cent down on February levels.Some services sectors continue to be more severely affected as many businesses remain closed, the ONS said. Among the biggest declines were in the food and beverage services industry where output was barely a quarter of pre-lockdown levels in June. Government ministers and economists will be closely watching the data for signs that any recovery continued to gain momentum in July and August as pubs, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, among other businesses, were allowed to reopen.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While that was largely expected as broad sections of the economy shut down, it remains to be seen how quickly people will have returned to their old spending habits in recent weeks.  Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: “The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.“The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and housebuilding continuing to recover.“Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.“Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.”Economists forecast that, although the coronavirus recession is unprecedentedly deep, it should be of short duration.“While the UK recession involved a record contraction, it should at least be limited to two quarters,” said Howard Archer, chief economist of the EY Item Club. “The economy has been growing at an increasing rate since May and it appeared to take a further step forward in July as lockdown restrictions were eased further.“The substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus that has been enacted should provide ongoing support to the economy.”He added: “There should also be some pent-up demand following the overall reduction in consumer spending in the second quarter, while household purchasing power is being helped by very low inflation. Global economic activity is also now improving as other economies recover from the impact of coronavirus. This will help UK exports.”Moving out of the technical recession does not mean that the economic pain is over, however. Businesses hit hard by the pandemic are expected to lay off large numbers of staff over the coming months as support measures such as the furlough scheme come to an end.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the ONS figures “confirm that hard times are here”.“Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.“But while there are difficult choices to be made ahead, we will get through this, and I can assure people that nobody will be left without hope or opportunity.”Official data showed this week that around 730,000 UK workers have been removed from the payrolls of British companies since March when the coronavirus lockdown began.The number of hours worked each week plunged by a fifth and 7.5 million people were temporarily absent from work in July.The Bank of England forecast last week that the economy will shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 after a rebound in the second half of the year as restrictions ease and activity gears up again.It upgraded its forecast after energy usage and travel data suggested a faster pick-up than had been predicted. The bank previously predicted a 14 per cent contraction.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new report provides insight into the species’ devastating decline. Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Such high levels of infections have not been seen since mid-April during the height of national lockdown.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe French health ministry’s public health arm, Santé Publique, said the infection rate in the week beginning 3 August was fastest among people aged 15 to 44, adding it was a “troubling situation”.Data from the agency showed the incidence rate of Covid-19 in the 20 to 29 age group rose to nearly 45 per 100,000 people, over six times the rate it was in early May.As race for home begins, there\u0027s no space on Channel crossingsFrance quarantine throws holiday plans into chaos as mask fines riseInside Politics: Grant Shapps adds France to quarantine listHow France joining ‘no-go’ list will affect British travellersUK imposes quarantine measures for travellers coming from FranceThe incidence rate also rocketed to 26.5 from 6.1 (per 100,000) among those aged 30 to 39. Last month, France’s health minister Olivier Véran confirmed the newer positive cases were “younger than during the previous wave” of coronavirus.He said this suggested that “people in more vulnerable groups have doubtless remained more prudent” while younger people “tend to pay less attention”.Experts warned that a more blasé attitude towards virus control measures, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, was resulting in rising numbers of Covid-19 cases across the continent.Richard Peabody, an epidemiologist leading the High Threat Pathogens Team at the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe, called on European governments to take note of the lessons learned when the pandemic first hit.France escalates coronavirus response as outbreak hits ‘tipping point’Prime Minister Jean Castex urged French citizens to stay vigilant on Tuesday, adding: “If we don’t act collectively, we expose ourselves to the heightened risk that the rebound in the epidemic becomes hard to control.”On Thursday night, the UK added France to its travel quarantine list, which meant travellers arriving from France after 4am on Saturday will be required to quarantine for two weeks.France joins Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Bahamas on the travel quarantine list.

The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Scotland, they were over-generous to the tune of  per cent — and even more so in some “deprived” areas.The Scottish schoolkids were pretty hacked off to find their grades reduced by the boards, and moaned about it. So the Scottish government caved in and let them have their original grades. The ones that were overvalued.And so when little Jimmy proudly displays his long list of As and Bs to prospective employers — or, God help us, a university — people will just snigger.They know he can’t spell his own name or, like the rabbits in Watership Down, count past five. Nobody will take the results seriously after the Scottish government did its cowardly U-turn.Sadly for the youngsters, they will be pretty meaningless results. Which is a horrible thing to say after they’ve been studying for so long.South of the border we’re doing things a little better. Kids will be able to take the grade awarded to them. Or they can choose to use the result they got in their mocks — exams taken before Mr Covid arrived on the scene. Or they can take a special written exam in the autumn.That’s more sensible. But I suspect, even so, that employers and the universities will be a little wary of taking the results at face value. They will have their doubts.All of this has happened because we’re trying to be kind to the kids. And the reason we’re being kind is because these past six months we have let them down badly. The Government has let them down — and even more so, the teachers.Too many schools had no virtual classrooms at all during lockdown. The kids might have been sent a few worksheets. But time with their teachers was non-existent, even via Zoom.Too many teachers have been absolutely bone idle. Two-thirds of children have taken part in no virtual lessons whatsoever. Schools refused to make them — so the kids skived. And that’s in schools where there WERE regular virtual lessons.My own child, a girl of , completed five physics papers during lockdown. And being my daughter, sent them to the wrong email address. Nobody checked, nobody cared.The truth is our kids have had six months of doing nowt. Being nice to them now because we ignored their needs through spring and summer is all well and good. But it does not excuse the disgraceful behaviour of the teaching unions. Nor the failure of the Government to stand up to the unions.The result of all this will be a bigger ide than ever between poorer and richer kids. The middle classes are flocking to the private sector — where schools WILL be open and there’s always a full timetable of virtual work.For the rest — just the suspicion that they have been treated very badly indeed. By the people whose responsibility it was to look after them.It’s time Labour came clean about our teachers. Do they want the schools to reopen or not  And no more weasel words about keeping everybody safe. You cannot eliminate risk entirely, as Sir Keir Starmer well knows.We are now in a recession. Nothing will drag us out of it more quickly than the schools reopening, full-time, no s nor buts. Then the rest of us can get back to work.THE former boss of McDonald’s is in trouble for having exchanged nude pics with fellow workers.Brit Steve Easterbrook, pictured with Alesha Dixon at the London  Olympics, is also in trouble for having slept with a few colleagues.Now, those pics.I don’t knowSteve has a Whopper, a Quarter Pounder, a Big n’ Tasty – or just a chicken nugget. But nobody complained about them at the time. All of his relationships were consensual. And Steve was a orcee. What seems to me wrong is McDonald’s banning all of its staff from having relationships in-house.I WONDER how Prince Andrew has been coping during this heatwave If you remember, he explained to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he has an inability to sweat. Just can’t do it. He must be bursting, underneath his skin. Perhaps he will explode.Me, I’m sick of sweating. A three-minute walk to the local river ends up with me looking like I’ve just swam a mile in it.I’ve even started wearing shorts, which I hate. The noncey scout leader look – it’s all the rage.The BBC was worrying about this hot spell. Wonderedit was the result of global warming.Isn’t it something to do with that thing called “summer” I seem to remember it kind of happening before, you know I’m talking about the people who, in the middle of a global pandemic, travel abroad for their holidays. And are then surprised there are problems on account of the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic.Truth is, I have about as much sympathy as I do for people who travel to appalling war-torn countries for their hols then whine at the British Government to get them out.Would it hurt THAT much just to stay in the UK this summer WEDNESDAY was a pretty bad day for grouse.They have it circled in their diaries each year, in red. The “Glorious Twelfth”. This is when City boys and braying toffs take to the grouse moors and start blasting away at anything that moves. Especially grouse. Slow, heavy birds. Not very bright. Hard to miss them from eight yards with a -bore, evenyou’re a halfwit.It’s a bad day for the rest of us, too. And for our countryside. Grouse moors take up an astonishing eight per cent of our land. And yet they are kept solely for the grouse and the , or so numpties who try to shoot them every year.As a result, these moorlands are almost entirely devoid of wildle. Just barren deserts full of heather and nothing .And the gamekeepers burn the heather every spring – just when any songbirds might be nesting. The rest of their time is taken up shooting or trapping our most beautul and endangered birds of prey.Gamekeepers have almost wiped out our hen harriers, for example. Those moors should be teeming with le. Andthey were they’d be a much more attractive proposition for tourists – who would really bring money in to the local communities.Why do we preserve eight per cent of our land for the benefit of just . per cent of our population  Just so they can wear tweed for a day and pretend they’re Carlos The Jackal Probably end up glowing like one of those light sticks kids have on Bonfire Night. One expert reckoned that a side-effect was swelling up until you’re the size of the Kremlin.In the US, President Trump was suggesting swallowing disinfectant as a cure.

I am proud to “confess” that I have been on two foreign holidays in the past month, utilising legal air bridges, and I am far from ashamed.The myth in coronaphobic Britain is that overseas trips are for the elite, rich and powerful: If you dare get on a plane to low infection-rate locales such as Italy or Greeceyou’re not showing solidarity to the Covid cause and risk spreading the damned virus.That rhetoric hasn’t been helped by the Government’s feeble air bridge policy, which puts any country with a region experiencing a minor outbreak at risk of being added to the quarantine list.The reality is the total opposite. If you and me are shamed into staying home now, travel WILL soon be limited to the elite, rich and powerful.The democratisation of tourism has been one of the most pleasing developments of this new millennium, with the explosion of budget airlines causing price wars and a move towards all-inclusive package deals.Yet our ability to keep seeing the world is now in real peril.Airlines are on their knees. Hotels are closing at an alarming rate. Many popular European tourist destinations remain ghost towns.Goons in the Extinction Rebellion movement have already talked weak parties including Labour into backing the introduction of more travel taxes.All for a virus that, albeit nasty, killed just a fth of the number of people who died from run-of-the-mill flu and pneumonia in the final week of July in the UK.If you’re one of the many people currently tormented over whether to take the risk and book that break, I implore you to go for it.On a practical level, both my week-long trips to Europe were pure ecstasy, with responsible and reassuring safety measures that never came close to overshadowing the glorious experience of being overseas again, something unimaginable just a couple of months ago.Yes, the airport is a little more torturous than usual and you do have to keep the mask on at all times.When I arrived on the Greek Island of Mykonos last week, I was random Covid tested at immigration, causing a touch of nervousness while I waited -hours for the result.  And you’re not going to be able to dance or listen to loud music at night.But the benefits are endless. Your favourite tourist destinations are emptier than they’ve ever been during peak season, you’ll always get into your favourite restaurant, and the staff on British Airways have never been happier to see you on board.Most importantly,more of us choose to fly now, we will help keep affordable travel and tourism viable for years to come.I was one of just three people in total in a gym this week for a pre-booked, hour-long session.When we were booted out the moment our  minutes were up, the entire fitness centre was shut for a -minute deep clean.While we should, of course, encourage cleanliness, these types of self-imposed and over-the-top rules will make it impossible for most businesses to survive long-term.A healthy dose of common sense should be required, too.THE Prince of Woke emerged from his latest multi-million pound Calornian mansion this week to preach to the world, yet again, about racism.In an online conversation with Rashad Robinson, president of US civil rights group Colour Of Change, the usual clichés and judgy mumbo jumbo were out in full force.He spoke of “acting, rather than just saying”, going to “the root of the problem” and charity being “like bringing a bucket of water to a forest fire”.But what Harry didn’t talk about was his own notorious past of racist language and cultural insensitivities.After all, this was the Duke who was forced to undergo racial sensitivity training in the Army after using the P-word to refer to an Asian soldier.And this was the Duke who wore a Nazi unorm to a friend’s birthday party.If Harry wants to help spark real change and debate, it would be much more effective for him to stop the meaningless platitudes and talk publicly in some detail about his own journey.How did he realise that using the P-word as an adult is not unacceptable in any circumstances How did he learn that larking about with a swastika around your arm as a member of the Royal Family is just plain wrong The Duke does have a valuable contribution to make about the need to stamp out everyday racism in society – one that will involve less pious preaching and more examination of his own notorious follies and foibles.LIKE Emily Maitlis, Naga Munchetty has become such a powerful BBC News presenter she believes the rules of the public service broadcaster no longer apply to her.First, the Breakfast presenter threw impartiality out the window to express a negative view about the US president Donald Trump.Now this week she has been caught pocketing cash to appear in corporate videos for the troubled car company Aston Martin.The Sun’s TV Editor Andy Halls revealed Naga didn’t follow protocol by seeking approval from her Beeb bosses and did not declare the fee she received either.That would be a sacking offence for most Beeb newsreaders.But Naga received the most minor slap on the wrist, with BBC bosses saying, “She has been reminded of the risk of conflict of interest when undergoing external engagements”.No wonder other BBC news presenters don’t want to follow the rules either.The corporation’s weak approach is asking for trouble.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It should have been a day of excitement, a day I was hoping to keep the promise I made to you four years ago at your brother Haydon’s surprise st party.That day I crossed my fingers and hid them behind my back as I smiled and said, “I promise I will not throw you a surprise birthday party on your st. We will go on holiday instead.”Leah, I had no intention of ever keeping that promise.Yes, we wanted to take you on holiday, we wanted to take you to Costa Rica for your st.But I was planning one big surprise party before we went, with family and friends all there to help celebrate.We had a meal with family for your th — that is what you wanted. You were never one to look for attention.Always trying to hide in the corner, usually attached to you phone.You like a family party, you just don’t want to be the reason it is being held.Tomorrow it is another milestone in your disappearance — you will have been missing exactly  months.On Friday, February , last year you woke about ten minutes after we left the house to go to work.You got ready for work, opened the curtains, made your bed and left the house at your usual time.CCTV caught you walking, on your phone as usual. We know you sent Snapchat streaks to friends as always. And then you vanished.Roughly  minutes after being captured on CCTV your phone was switched off and it has never been turned on or used in any way again.That is when you vanished for real. No one has seen or heard from you since. No one has found any of your belongings.That was my reality  months ago and is still the same today.We have had so many acts of kindness.

We will never heal from the needless and heinous pain you have caused.You have taken a kind, naive young lady who had everything to look forward to and stopped her le in her prime.You have robbed her family and friends of a caring, loving inidual. You broke her brother, Haydon, mentally.You have taken away grandchildren that we will never meet. Stopped two wedding days that we will never get the chance to plan.To lose one child is the most horrendous experience in le, one you would not wish on your worst enemy.To not know why that child is no longer with you, or eventhey are OK is torturous.To lose two children is soul-destroying.I do not know how I get up every day.

We look forward to our day in court and receiving justice.”Grishin claimed that he was duped into loaning , to a production company run by the pair – alleging that the money was used to fund their lestyles and to lease a Bentley.But the pair countersued, claiming Grishin started a campaign of terror against Anna.The court papers also make dramatic allegations that Grishin confessed to taking credit for a scheme that stole billion from the Russian Central Bank in the s.He is said to have made the confession in a now-deleted selfie video uploaded online.In court documents, seen by The Sun, it is alleged that he sent numerous death threats, violent images, and pornographic images to his we and Sulkess in text and video messages.The court papers claim that he texted his we saying he had a Glock gun with an I-round clip for her.He allegedly added in the text: Everything happens at the Four Seasons, on the bouled, in daytime when theres plenty of light. Special bullets so they bury you in a closed casket.Chillingly, the Russian was accused in the court documents of trying to kill his we by pointing a gun with a silencer at her head and forcing her to strip at gun point.The court papers claim that he then punched his we in the face and head-butted her – breaking several of her teeth.He is then alleged to have text Sulkess stating that his we is not pretty anymore and missing some teeth.Grishin is also claimed to have threatened to hire a hit man to take care of  people in rambling recordings he sent to his wes mother, according to court docs.Grishin – said to have had restraining orders taken out against him - is also alleged to have made a  police report in Russia that got Fedoseeva arrested and imprisoned for ten days.The Russian authorities are said to have started an investigation into the incident, according to the lawsuit.Anna also claims, in court papers, that he hacked into to her computer, and published private selfie photos of her and Sulkess on the internet.He was approached for comment on Thursday.A spokesman for Grishin denied the allegations and told the Daily Mail that he was the unfortunate victim of a fraud by Fedoseeva in respect of which he has been obliged to file legal proceedings against her.His legal claim sets out that fewer than two months after their marriage, Ms Fedoseeva became romantically involved with another woman and thereafter entered into a scheme to defraud him out of millions of dollars to finance her and her lovers lestyles.When that fraudulent scheme failed, Ms Fedoseeva made a series of  and highly defamatory allegations about Mr Grishin – including of physical threats and violence – which are utterly fancul, hotly denied and have no basis in truth whatever, and which Mr Grishin trusts will be proven to be entirely  when the matter comes before the court.Sulkess, , also told the outlet: I keep reading articles which say that Harry and Meghan have quietly bought this house.I would try and keep it quiet tooI bought a house from a Russian oligarch who was…in court for terrorising his we with a gun. He is a monster.Clearly whatever advisers they have cannot have done any kind of due diligence.Grishin is no stranger to big real estate deals in Montecito after he owned the sprawling mansion made-famous by the  gangster movie Scarface.He sold that iconic property, which in the past hosted the likes of Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, for m in .Harry and Meghan have reportedly taken out a .m mortgage on the nine-bedroom property which was previously listed for m.Their huge ,-square-foot palatial pad, known as The Chateau, was bought by Grishin in  for m - however he has struggled to find wealthy buyers able to meet the asking price.It was eventually listed again in January, for around m and sold to the royal couple for around .m under that asking price.According to real estate agents who spoke with the LA Times, the deal was closed in an “off-market” sale in June.Tax records for the mansion match the limited liability companies previously created by Meghan, it has been reported.Pictures from a previous listing of the property on five acres of land show it appears to have a stripper pole installed in its gym.It is not knownthe quirky feature has since been removed. The huge pad also has its own kids playground.A source close to Meghan and Harry says the couple are calling the luxury mansion their sanctuary.“Harry and Meghan have settled into their new home and say they are still figuring things out, they hope when Covid lets up their lives will become easier,” a source said.“They realised they needed a big home with a lot of space for Archie because they can rarely leave the house due to their fame, they are still quite nervous about going out and about.“They have been worried about Archie as hes been inside so much during lockdown and not interacting with other children, but everyone has reassured them that they’re doing a great job.“Meghan wanted somewhere with a spectacular garden and the house has a giant pool and pond for them to enjoy.They say this new house is their sanctuary.“She has been speaking about getting an easel to sit outside and paint during quiet moments, she loves the Calornia sunsets.“Harry seems a lot more relaxed, he’s walking around the house in shorts and a t-shirt, unshaven and is friendly with the staff, they think he’s adorable.“He is particularly relaxed now they have a full security team and he’s talked about how impressed he is by the team, who are former LAPD and ex-servicemen.“They are still looking for a housekeeper and hope to find one when the pandemic eases up, but they do have staff who are sent out with a list for groceries.”Located inside a secure gated community, the mansion has a giant swimming pool, sauna, wine cellar and a five-car garage.It also has a two bedroom guest house, which would be perfect for Meghans mom Doria to stay at.An old ad for the property describes it as being in the heart of Montecito and recently modernized with up-to-date Lutron lighting and Crestron high-tech iPad controls.The . acre site has beautully clipped hedges bordering the entry gates before opening out onto a wide lane that is paved with Santa Barbara stone.The lane then leads through a stunning arch of trees up to the main building, which boasts a library, office, spa, gym, separate dry and wet saunas, games room, theatre, arcade, wine cellar, and a garage that can house five cars.The property is surrounded by large manicured laws, tiered rose gardens, blooming lavender, -year-old olive trees and tall Italian cypress trees.Other facilities include a tennis court and a swimming pool, while the estate also has several outbuildings - including a childrens cottage, a tea house, and a two-bedroom, two bathroom guest house.Frank Abatemarco, a local realtor for Sotheby’s told The Sun: “This is a semi-rural neighbourhood that has everything.It’s a great place for children and families. I can’t think of a greater place for them. The schools are also exceptional.”Asked how celebrities are treated in the area, he added: “People leave them alone. There’s no paparazzi here, people don’t make a fuss and allow them to have their privacy here.My guess is people will be very protective of them here, I’m a fan and we’d like to welcome them to Montecito.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris Johnson finally introduced the rule more than three weeks after his experts said wearing a clear plastic visor wasnapost enough to stop Covid-.The only compulsory thing hairdressers have had to wear since they reopened on July  has been a face visor. A covering hasnapost ever been needed over their nose and mouth - despite becoming compulsory in nearly all indoor public spaces and on public transport.In a meeting on July , a sub-group of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesruled visors alone are unlikely to be an effective control for aerosol transmission.SAGE added: We recommend that guidance for UK hairdressers and barbers should be strengthened to include wearing of face coverings. Yet the government dawdled over the findings for weeks, leading experts to speak out in protest. Now the guidance has finally been updated - and goes even further than what SAGE said on July . Instead of wearing a face covering, which can include a scarf or piece of cloth, anyone working in close contact services must now wear a full type  surgical mask. This includes hairdressers and barbers, as well as nail and beauty salons, tattoo, tanning and massage parlours, and dress fitters and tailors. Each mask must be worn only once and then discarded safely, ideally into a non-touch and self-closing bin.  New guidance adds: A Type II face mask should be worn with the visor. Type II face masks are not PPE but will provide a physical barrier to minimise contamination of the mouth and nose when used correctly. Ensure you are hydrated before putting a mask on. Face masks must also not be touched once on the face, and must be changedthey become moist or damaged, or dficult to breathe through. Downing Street said the move was taking into account new evidence provided by SAGE and consultation with industry. A statement added: This will help protect the customer and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking.  The original guidance to hairdressers, when they opened on July , said wearing a face covering may only be marginally beneficial, and the evidence it would protect customers is weak and the effect is likely to be small. Those phrases were removed on July , the day after the expertsapos meeting, and replaced with the words: There is growing evidence that wearing a face covering in an enclosed space helps protect iniduals and those around them from COVID-. However, face coverings are not an alternative for employees who wear a visor in close contact services. The guidance has now been updated yet again. The scientists made their recommendation after a US study found two COVID- infected hairdressers, who wore face coverings, did not pass on the disease to  clients.

The Department of Health and Social Carethis week announced the recall of tests supplied by Randox, which had been sent to care homes and for at-home testing, over concerns swabs included in the kits may not be sterile. They said the recall is a precautionary measure, the risk to safety is low, and test results from the kits are not affected.

Thereaposs no suggestion of any wrongdoing in how the contract was awarded.  Randox has claimed to supply % of the UKaposs coronavirus tests, though a DHSC source said the true figure is nearer %.DHSC said they recalled the tests, after pausing their use last month, because Randox were unable to provide safety documentation for one of their suppliers. The Mirror understands some swabs had a CE mark on them, but Randox failed to provide the government with certication to prove the mark was legitimate. DHSC has suspended the part of Randox’s contract which supplies swab test kits - but the government will still use the firm’s laboratories for coronavirus testing.

Test and Trace chief Dido Harding is also a member of the Jockey Club board, and was a close friend of Mrs Paterson.

Following the pausing of the ‘Randox COVID-  Home Testing Kit’ on  July, Randox have now recalled the testing kit as a precautionary measure. “Our testing support for care homes continues as any resident or member of staff with symptoms can immediately access a free test and we are exploring ways to increase the amount of testing, making full use of available lab capacity.” A spokesperson for Randox said it had been the firmaposs decision to recall the test kits.

The train derailed near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, on Wednesday, leaving three people dead and six injured. The accident happened after the .am Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street ScotRail service crashed as heavy rain caused a landslip on the track. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told how he understood an off-duty conductor managed to get off a carriage and run to alert operators, while a member of the public raised the alarm having seen smoke billowing from the trees. The unnamed conductor reportedly walked a mile to the nearest signal box to get phone signal, prompting officials to shut the line. As the train derailed, two carriages tumbled down the embankment and went up in flames, while another seemed to have been flipped upside down. A massive multi-agency response was launched to get to the scene and rescue as many people as possible. Nearby, a farmeraposs field resembled a car park for ambulances. It was later announced that three had died and six were injured. Driver Brett McCullough, , conductor Donald Dinnie, , and passenger Christopher Stuchbury, , sadly died in the tragedy.Network Rail said it will use in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys to assess dozens of sites with similar characteristics to the stretch of railway near Stonehaven. It will also work with meteorologists to strengthen the information it receives about flash flooding while its engineers are reviewing the remote monitoring of high-risk sites with motion sensors and CCTV to test whether it can be improved.

The UK government announced late last night that all travellers ing from France must now self isolate for  days from am Saturday. The Foreign Office also advised against all non-essential travel to France It sparked a mad rush to get back to the UK before tomorrow with big queues forming at the ferry port this morning as Brits tried to rush home. Are you on holiday in France at the moment or due to fly out  Email us at webtravel@trinitymirror Eurotunnel and Brittany Ferries have warned people not to turn up at terminals unless they have a booking. But savvy Julia Burnett, , and husband Craig, , had already cut short their camping holiday fearing the worst and were just  miles from Calais when the announcement was made. They drove yesterday for an incredible  hours from the South of France to Calais with their three children Rory, seven, Isabella, five and Finley, one.  They were due to come back next Wednesday but yesterday decided to set off from Biarritz, after reading rumours about a potential quarantine. The family, from Taunton in Somerset, managed to book onto a ferry less than an hour before the government announcement. When they were  miles from Calais they discovered their gamble had paid off when they saw news of the rule change. They were in the queue for the ferry crossing feeling “tired but relieved” this morning.  Julia said: “We’d been trying to book onto the Channel tunnel but we eventually booked on the ferry instead. “Then I checked back on the tunnel website straight after the announcement and I was ,th in the queue - it was crazy. “Quarantine would have really affected Craig’s work as he runs a dental services business and can’t do it from home.” The Burnett family were among half a million Brits said to be on holiday in France, with around , expected toto the UK before the summer holidays end.  Lucky Brits who were already due totoday or who managed to get a last minute booking arrived back in Londonaposs St Pancras station this morning. But many others scrambling to get home face paying hundreds of pounds and blasted the government’s decision. Lewis Kitson, , was desperately trying to book a ticket at the ferry port in Calais this morning. The IT manager, of Putney, south west London, said: “This is just a complete shambles. They’re making it up as they go along now. It’s chaos.  “They can’t justy this. It’s guess work. I’m not bothered about quarantineI’m too late. I’ve just come through France on a road trip. “They’ll have to put me in prison before I comply with quarantine. “The whole thing is ridiculous. It’s still not enough time. I’m really trying to get a ferry booked.” Michael Smallwood, , booked eight days’ camping in Calais with four pals. He was due to travel back on Monday but was today frantically trying to transfer his tickets after his we this morning called him from their home in New Ash Green, Kent, to tell him of the new rules.  Michael, who owns a cleaning business, said: “I’ve got lots of work planned in the next two weeks and soI don’t get back today, this could severely affect me financially. “It was announced late at night and I wish we had been given more time to get out. “PO’s response has been pretty disappointing so far. I haven’t been able to get through on the phone and I’m struggling to change our tickets.”British businessman Charlie Varley – who owns holiday homes in northern France - launched a scathing attack on Boris Johnsonaposs decision to impose quarantine. He said: “Itaposs a bloody nightmare. “Weaposve been hit all season because of the Brit government’s indecisive bulls**t. “We have already had several cancellations we have had to refund earlier in the season and here we go again. “Ourselves and countless other gîteowners have lost a large part of our customer base. “And then the insurance companies refuse to pay out those customers who took out insurance because the British government just gave them a get out clause. “If the government imposed a quarantine, most people’s holiday insurance is null and void because technically they can still take the holiday. It’s not a valid reason to cancel and for the insurance to pay out. “One of our guests who cancelled earlier said it left her children in tears. “They were so looking forward to their visit and the kids, just youngsters couldn’t understand why mum and dad had to cancel their holidays. “And this was before the quarantine. “They cancelled because of the uncertainty. “And let’s not forget it was ok for Boris’ dad to sneak off to Greece to check on his rental properties and for Cummings to take trips to stay with mum and dad. “Itaposs hard to keep up with the hypocrisy, indecision and buck passing of the British government these days.” People trying to get back to the UK face sky high prices.British Airways is charging £ for the cheapest tickets to fly direct from Paris to London Heathrow. The same journey on Saturday can be made with the airline for just £. The cheapest ticket on a Eurostar train from Paris to London is £, compared with £ on Saturday. The cost of taking a car through the Channel Tunnel on Eurotunnel Le Shuttle services on Friday is £. This is £ more expensive than journeys taken on Saturday.

Areas around the market town of Halax now have infection rates higher than key hotspots such as Leicester, Blackburn and Darwen and Luton, she said. Government data shows the ward of Pellon East has seen a stark rise in cases, with  recorded between August  and . Pellon West and Highroad Well had  cases of coronavirus recorded across the same week. Debs Harkins has now appealed to the people of Calderdale to in a desperate bid to get help from residents to bring the rate back down again.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereYorkshire, along with other major northern hubs such as Manchester and Leeds were placed back on lockdown meaning two households were no longer allowed to meet. The rules means families and friends could only socialise with those who they lived with or one other person living alone who had already formed a bubble with another houehold. The rules applied to both indoor and outdoor socialising.In her statement, Debs Harkins said it is clear that too many restrictions were lted too quickly and said she cannot stress how serious the situation is, reports Yorkshire Live. She said: The first of August was four months to the day since I started working in Calderdale. I began my work here at the beginning of April, a couple of weeks into the national lockdown. I marked my four-month anniversary with the introduction of local restrictions, brought in because the borough has one of the highest COVID- infection rates in the country. I have to say, these four months have been some of the hardest times in my  years working in public health. Just to give you some perspective, the only time that compares to this for me was the  months when I worked from a hospital isolation room as I underwent treatment for an aggressive form of Leukaemia, which I only had a % chance of recovering from.  Being the voice of doom doesn’t come naturally to me. I try to find the positives in every situation, even being treated with a le-threatening illness! But I’m sorry to say that I’m writing this today to stress how serious the situation in Calderdale is, and to ask for your help to tackle COVID-. I have been out and about in the borough, talking and listening to people in our communities, and I have heard from many people how shocked they are that COVID- is still here with us. I heard that people made enormous sacrices to keep infection rates low, and when the restrictions were lted in June, they believed that things would start toto normal and we could all start to enjoy the things we used to take for granted. People in high incidence areas told me they feel stigmatised and blamed for the situation we now find ourselves in. When we look at the trends in confirmed cases in Calderdale, it’s clear that too many restrictions were lted too quickly.  In parts of Halax particularly, the infection rates are among the very highest in the country. The situation can change rapidly, and at the time I’m writing this, there are no areas in Leicester, Blackburn with Darwen or Luton, where the infection rates are higher than those we can see in some parts of Halax. Infection rates in Calderdale are currently increasing faster than in any other borough in the Yorkshire and Humber region. She continued: I’m asking for your help today to bring the infection rate down. This is important to us all for many reasons. We all want to get our freedoms back so we can visit family and friends outside our households. Many of us will know people who are medically vulnerable to the serious effects of COVID- and will want to ensure that the infection rate remains low to protect them, as the national shielding programme ends and we prepare for the winter demands on health and care services.

Abbie Cooper, from Cwmbran, Wales, said it felt like there was a letter generator which gave out grades. Disappointed with her results, she said how can I go anywhere with these - and she is not the only one left feeling there has been injustice. Abbie, , told the Press Association yesterday: Last year, I couldnapost attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work, Iaposd still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predictedat the end of the year was a B-B-B. I thought Iaposd pretty much secured at least a C, but I checked my results this morning and it said U-D-D. Abbie, who attends Coleg Gwent, received D grades in politics and psychology and a U in biology and is now worried about what the results will mean for her university prospects. It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that, she said. It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predictions for university. How can I go anywhere with these  Abbie, who is a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament, said she knows many people whose grades were lower than they were expecting.  Abbie said: Iaposm quite distraught. But Iaposm good in the sense itaposs out there now and people know andpeople are in the same boat they know theyaposre not alone. I know people who were predicted A*s and theyaposve been getting Bs. Itaposs awful. She hopes to appeal over her grades. With no exams possible this year because of the pandemic, teachers were asked to submit the grades they felt each student would have achieved and a rank of all their pupils. Exam boards then moderated the grades to ensure the results were broadly in line with previous years. Student gutted after predicted As downgraded to a D Chloe Ray who was predicted straight As has told of her disappointment after she opened her results.  The student, from Elswick, had been awarded a D in her physics A-level following national moderation – signicantly lower than the grade her school originally predicted.  aposI put unimaginable effort into my studiesaposLaura Hodgson says she aposput unimaginable amounts of effortapos into her studies at Pendleton Sixth Form in  Salford, studying for A-levels in biology, chemistry and a diploma in sport and exercise science.But despite being predicted A and B grades, she was awarded two Cs, along with a distinction for her diploma.I logged on at am and saw the Cs and just started sobbing for about an hour, Laura told the MEN. I just feel angry about it. When you get results from doing exams then youaposve only got yourself to blameyou do bad, but this has been out of our control.   Pupil says his future is aposup in the airapos Thomas Chandler, , Richmond, North Yorkshire A pupil has told how he feels left dangling after failing to be awarded an A* in either English literature or German to study Classics at Cambridge. Thomas was graded As for both, scoring an A* in art. He said: “It’s frustrating. I was getting A* in course work and in class. Cambridge are waiting to decide.” He hopes to have his English literature upgraded. He said: “Everyone  can celebrate and I am left up in the air.”  aposI feel I canapost fully own my resultsaposRanya Kumar, , from Norwich, plans to study medicine at Cambridge and got four A s – on top of an A in maths last year.But despite being happy to get the grades, it was dficult to know they were awarded by algorithm. She said: “I feel I can’t fully own my results, which is a hard feeling. But as long as you get to the next stage, that’s what matters.” She said there “always will be” a stigma around results awarded this year “but when you get to university you will earn it again”.

Greggs launched its Quorn sausage roll as an experiment and found it was a runaway success. That proved to be just the beginning. For me the start was in childhood. My dad, a health freak, used to go in for “nut meat” which my mum did her best to dress up by grilling to make it more palatable for my sister and me. We hated it.Fast forward a few decades and the big fast-food chains have found fake meat to be popular. Burger King’s meat-free Rebel Whopper is doing well in Europe and the UK, and McDonald’s PLTburger is on the market. Meatless burgers are on sale in all Wetherspoon pubs.

The photographer, from Leek, said: I’m usually up there a few times a week. I was sat taking a photo of the sunset minding my own business. I then nodded off but then could hear someone coming. I looked around and couldn’t believe it. I thought I was dreaming. I nearly slapped myself to wake up. He was wearing a bum bag but nothing . He ran past two men. He then hid behind a wall when he saw a Asda delivery van come down a farm drive. The photographer was sat close to Roach End on the far side of the craggy rocks when he got an eyeful.  He added: I’m told he’s been seen in other areas. Heaposs been seen at the Manold and a friend of mine saw a naked man bathing at Three Shires. It’s wrong because a child might see him.

Victoria Jenkins started experiencing the painful side effect of intercourse around two years ago, when she was also left with a swollen stomach. The -year-old was forced to take painkillers each time she wanted to be intimate with boyfriend of eight years, Jack Morgan, after being diagnosed with pelvic congestion syndrome. The condition causes veins in the pelvis to become enlarged and sensitive. Victoria was officially diagnosed in , but as pain became unbearable over the years, she decided to research more long-term solutions. She discovered a procedure that could help - at a cost of an eye-watering £, to have the vein embolisation performed privately at the Whiteley Clinic, in London. After saving for the op, Victoria finally went under the kne where doctors inserted a tube into her neck, down her body and into her pelvis while she was awake. The freelance clothing designer for Unhidden, an adaptive fashion label for people with disabilities, was only given a local anesthetic on her neck and a small dose of diazepam to calm her nerves. She was then told to squeeze a stress ball as  metal coils were inserted inside the tube to travel down to her pelvic veins and scar them, which will close them off permanently, stopping the pain. After two weeks of healing, Victoria was finally able to have intercourse with Jack for the first time in three months and says the pain is finally bearable and she is getting better every day. Victoria said: Weaposve had sex once after I had the operation a week ago and already I could feel a huge dference - especially in my left side. I was in pain during sex before but the agony of the procedure itself was horric. Over the past eight years Iaposve built up a high tolerance to pain - I admitted myself to AE two days after my stomach ulcer burst! But this procedure was like nothing Iaposve ever felt before - I felt like my pelvic area was on fire and had razor-blades cutting into it. I was given a syringe to bite down on and a stress ball to squeeze. I also had a nurse holding my arm to comfort me, but nothing helped and I was shouting out from pain.  Even though it was the most painful procedure Iaposve ever experienced, Iaposm happy I had it done and hope that the effects of the operation will only get better. Victoriaaposs nightmare began in  when she started to experience dull, period-like pains all the time, shooting pains down her legs and swelling of her stomach when she walked. Sex became excrutiating. I thought it was a cyst on my oies, Victoria, of Islington, London said. Iaposve had them in the past and the symptoms were similar so I thought it would go on its own. But the pain continued and it got to the point where I needed to go and see someone to get some answers. Experiencing pain during and after sex isnapost normal and I didnapost want my relationship to be effected because of it. But a gynaecologist revealed that Victoria was actually suffering from Pelvic Congestion Syndrome and there was no treatment or cure she could have on the NHS. I was desperate to sort it out so went to a private doctor who gave me painkillers but they didnapost do anything, she said. The pain during sex was really extreme, and because I couldnapost relax Iaposd seize up.  Sex would leave Victoria with a swollen lower abdomen and the condition could also leave her bed bound. There were times when I couldnapost get out of bed for a week, it was so bad. Victoria tried to cope with the pain before paying another private doctor to prescribe lidocaine pain patches - which work by stopping nerve signals to the brain - but they didnapost help either. It became painful to even stand up and walk for more than  minutes and Iaposd be swollen and bloated just from that. Sometimes Iaposd look three months pregnant and could only wear leggings as they were the most comfortable thing I had. Finally, Victoria decided to have surgery done privately as it wasnapost available on the NHS. In January this year Victoria went for a consultation, supported by her boyfriend, Jack , a market researcher. He was shocked to discover the extent of her pain during intercourse. We were talking to the consultant and he said that I must have problems being intimate and asked meit causes me a lot of pain, she said.  I blushed at that point and Jack was shocked, as I hadnapost been honest with him about just how painful it really was. I was worried about putting a strain on the relationship. Weaposve been together for eight years and I thought thatI told him then he would be too worried that I was in pain to have sex. Butyou take sex away then itaposs just like youaposre living with a friend. I wanted to show Jack just how much I loved him. After Victoria admitted the truth, she and Jack didnapost have sex for a month as he didnapost want to hurt her.We just hoped that once the procedure was done, Iaposd be out of pain and we could get our sex le back on track, she explained. Victoria was meant to have surgery performed in May, but it was postponed until July  because of coronavirus. I have a high threshold anyway from years of chronic pain, she said. But nothing could have prepared me for the agony of the procedure. I thought Iaposd be getting some kind of anaesthetic so that I couldnapost feel anything at all, but I didnapost.  I lay on my side wearing a face mask while the nurse gave me a small dose of diazepam because I was so anxious. I also had local anesthetic applied to the area of my neck that they were inserting the tubes in - but that was it. I was given a syringe to bite down on and a stress ball to squeeze for when the pain became overwhelming. When the coils reached my pelvic area it felt like razor blades cutting into me. It was horric pain, the worst Iaposve ever felt - like cystitis times a thousand. Doctors then inserted nine platinum and two tungsten coils down the tube and into her pelvic area. Victoria estimates that each coil was mm wide and cm long. That bit was so painful I kept on shouting out while squeezing the ball and biting down hard on the syringe, she said. My leg kept jolting because of the pain and I thought at one point I was going to accidentally kick one of the nurses. I was told the average procedure time was  minutes. But it ended up taking hr  minutes as they had to put in more coils than they planned. Finally, the procedure was over and she was wheeled to recovery. The second I saw Jack I just burst into tears she said. I told him how badly it had hurt and he gave me a hug and was really supportive.  Victoria was told to wait for  hours before having sex but left it over a week instead. I wanted to make sure I was completely healed and give the coils a chance to work, she says. But when we finally had sex the pain was already so much more bearable, especially on the left side of my pelvis. I hope that it will have even more of an effect than it already has and will make having sex completely pain-free again. The coils will stay in for the rest of my le. I canapost physically feel them inside me, but my body is aware that theyaposre there. The effects of the vein embolisation are meant to last for le - unless more icose veins appear in Victoriaaposs pelvis. Victoria suffers from nine other conditions - including IBS, gastroparesis, erticular disease and Raynaudaposs syndrome - which all cause her chronic pain. I find it hard to stand up for more than  minutes at a time. I bought a walking stick in January to help me move about more easily which has really helped. Victoria has also had her gallbladder and appendix removed and has had an additional exit made from her stomach into her intestine to help her digest food more easily following her gastroparesis- a condition where the stomach cannot empty itself of food in the normal way. The clothing designer believes that her health fell into decline following a burst stomach ulcer in , which she was visiting the doctors for three years before it burst.  Every time I went to the doctor with stomach pains theyaposd tell me I was stressed or had IBS, she said. I knew it wasnapost either, but had to wait until my ulcer burst for anyone to listen to me. Surgeons tried to do keyhole surgery but had to cut me open to drain out the stomach acid and check there was no damage to my organs. After I spent five days in hospital and had a morphine pump, but the vein embolisation procedure was so much more painful than the stomach ulcer.apos But looking back now Iaposd say the operation was worth the pain. If more icose veins developed in my pelvis and I needed the procedure done again, I would have it but would ask to be sedated first this time. The procedure has enabled me to have a normal sex le again with my partner and even thought it was nearly two hours of excrutiating pain it was worth it.

They spoke highly of the league and said they think I could come and do well.“Man City hold Scotland in high regard, as they should. City are very good, they’re in contact a lot.“They spoke to me at the weekend after the game and are always looking come and visit.”Of potentially facing Frimpong at Tannadice when Celtic call in a week on Saturday, Bolton continued: “It should be good.“If I’m picked and he plays on my side then it’ll be a good battle.“He’s a year below me so we’ve kind of grown up together, we were at the same school with all the City lads.“I’ve seen him grow up and have played with him over the years. He’s a good lad.“There’s no fakeness with him, he’s just a down to earth lad. He’s done really well.“Fair play to him because he’s taken his opportunity and, obviously, I’m hoping to do the same here.“Patrick Roberts is another who did well in Scotland and, like I said, City are keen to use the league as a playground for their loan stars.“Long may it continue. It’s brought people on that have previously done it.”Although they had no prior relationship, Bolton insists Tangerines boss Micky Mellon was also a major factor in him joining the club.“My agent had spoken to the manager before me and said he spoke really well,” the City kid added.“I’ve also had a few people I know tell me he’s a great manager and, after speaking to him, I got along with him and believed in what he wanted to do.“I’m really enjoying it, to be fair.“The lads are great with me and I’m enjoying working with the manager and being in a new league.“There’s a lot of exposure to the league, which is good for my personal profile, but obviously I spoke to the manager about his plans, too.“We’ve shown so far that we’re an established Premiership team and we back ourselves.“I couldn’t turn it down. He spoke well of the club and the city so it was easy.”Bolton has no in-depth knowledge of Scottish football but insists he is learning every week.After a spell on loan at Luton Town last term, he believes the Premiership is somewhat comparable to the English second tier.Bolton commented: “Obviously I’d watched Scottish football for years, all the Old Firm games and cup matches on Sky but knowing the actual league in and out, not too much.“I’m learning week in, week out the dferences and stuff like that.“It’s very similar to the Championship down south but what I would say is here it’s mph.“It’s end to end, and the Championship in England is known for that, but I think it’s even more so here.“All the teams you go up against are fit and will run constantly. It’s about adapting to that and I think I’m doing so.“I feel like we play some good football and mix it up at times but, obviously, in every league you come up against teams that want to go long and some teams that want to play the ball.“They’re very similar in that sense.”Dundee United manager Micky Mellon says Hibs# goal at Tannadice last night was offside as he delivers injury update on Lawrence Shankland\" title\"#Dundee United manager Micky Mellon says Hibs# goal at Tannadice last night was offside as he delivers injury update on Lawrence Shankland# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-hibs-offside-lawrence-shankland embed # secretFLLuDSKvL\" data-secret\"FLLuDSKvL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Her success to date is further evidence of the growing demand for such facilities that make the arts accessible to everyone.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

On-loan teenager Ryan Edmondson has ed to parent club Leeds United having suffered an ankle injury in training earlier this week.It is feared the England U international, who made his debut off the bench in the - loss to Rangers, could be sidelined for up to four months.Last season’s leading scorer Sam Cosgrove is out for  weeks with a knee injury and Curtis Main is also sidelined.However, Anderson has been forced to self-isolate as he was one of the eight players who flouted lockdown protocol by recently visiting a busy city centre bar.The SFA and SPFL Joint Response Group are today set to reveal their punishment for the Aberdeen eight – Anderson, Jonny Hayes, Scott McKenna, Craig Bryson, Cosgrove, Mikey Devlin, Matty Kennedy and Dylan McGeouch.As well as delivering sanctions for recent breaches, including Celtic’s Boli Bolingoli who did not self-isolate after travelling to Spain, the JRG will also set out punishments for any future breach of Covid--specic football protocols or government public health guidelines by Scottish footballers.The Scottish football authorities could also punish Aberdeen and Celtic, in addition to their players, for the recent breaches.It is understood Pittodrie chairman Dave Cormack will today make a statement on the internal investigation into the Aberdeen eight.Two of those Dons players subsequently tested positive and had to quarantine for  days. The remaining six had to self-isolate for  days.Irvine said: “What has happened recently certainly doesn’t look good for the game in Scotland.“However the eight Aberdeen players have acknowledged it was a mistake.“Unfortunately the club have had to deal with the consequences of not playing those games.“It is a tough situation to have to deal with.“It is dficult for the club but also for the supporters.”In response to the recent breaches the JRG, along with the Scottish Government, have outlined a wide range of measures to “reinforce Scottish football’s commitment to public health and adherence to protocols.”After the Dons players have been hit by their sanctions Irvine insists it will be time for focus toto football.He said: “It was the right decision for the players to come out and identy themselves.“They made a mistake, admitted they had done wrong and will now have to deal with the consequences.“Hopefully it was a genuine mistake.“Now it is time to draw a line under it, move on and focus on playing football again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us.

Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

All of our funding comes from donations so this really is incredible.’John explained the inspiration behind the exhibition: ‘I did a lot of drawing of Holland on trips made over the years but I’d never painted it. The landscapes there made a huge impression on me. The sunrises and sunsets are amazing because the land is so flat.‘I love canals, so I decided to make that the theme and bring in paintings based on drawings I had done in Holland and Venice and around the Crinan Canal.’John and his we Maureen first visited Venice a few years ago for a special wedding anniversary and he has been painting the city since.He said: ‘Everyone said ‘Oh so you’ll be painting in Venice then ’ and I said ‘No, everybody and their Granny paints Venice and I’ll not be painting it’. Got off the Orient Express, walking down the  to the Grand Canal and then just looked across the water, thought ‘oh my goodness!’ and got the sketchbook out. Hundreds of drawings, , photographs – I just couldn’t believe it. I still love it and I still want to paint it.‘These paintings are paintings of memories. I have a photographic memory and can always recall a sunset or particular kind of light. Often I am painting things I remember from years and years back, like the lily pond by the Crinan Canal which is gone now, but I still miss it.‘Holland blew me away when I first saw it and Venice did too. I’ve been in Argyll for  years and it blew me away too when I first came here in the s.

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket..

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher.

No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal

day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on

midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"new-head-education-named","story":"Ms Brown is currently the chief operating officer for education with the local authority and will take the place of Fiona

Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant.

You might be able to get hold of some crayfish or lobster baskets, which give an area a nice seaside feel,\" Talbot advises.\"Thick ropes, which you often see tying a boat to a mooring, are a great accessory. You can get a garden-sized boat and plant that up, putting it on a small shingle bed, with alpine grit over the top to finish.\"Display beach finds carefullyPerkins says you have to be careful when putting shells or drtwood youve found on beach-combing walks on display at random points in the garden. \"Instead of dotting things around, make a display cabinet of perhaps a series of shells, which makes sense of them being there.\"Create a beach-inspired social spot\"For me, being on the beach is about getting together in the evening and relaxed social gatherings, so I would think about fire pits, deck chairs and that sort of low-slung seating you can really relax into. Fire pits are great, whether you choose gas or wood fire,\" Perkins observes.Hammocks and outdoor bean bags could also be added to create that beach feel, he suggests."},{"url":null,"title":"travel-royal-family-retreats-scotland-every-year","story":"Travel: This is why the Royal Family retreats to Scotland every yearUndated Handout Photo of the Morrone Birkwood trail.

WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature TRAVEL Braemar.The Aberdeen-born poet and writer, whose face now adorns the Scottish pound note, made it her les quest to find the \"essential nature\" of the Cairngorms. In the process of exploring its graceful, gleaming rivers and high plateaus \"as delectable as honey\", she discovered a lot about herself too.Twice the size of the Lake District, East Scotlands Cairngorms National Park is a wilderness area of crisp, clear lochs, ancient forests and glens bristling with vibrant purple heather. Promising calm, quiet and the freedom of space, it seemed an obvious choice for a post-lockdown adventure with my mum, Gabriella.Aged over  and recovering from heart surgery, my mum had been shielding since March. Im not a fan of Zoom or FaceTime, so when we met at Heathrow airport to catch our flight to Aberdeen, it was the first time Id seen her in four months.In a world where every move seems to be dominated by Covid-, the decision to travel isnt an easy one to make at any age. But as days disappear and months march on, theres an urgency to get moving. Ive never really understood why time accelerates with age. The harder we grip, the more it slips away. Maybe its the realisation that everything is finite, including us.Then there was the risk of being indefinitely confined by anxiety.\"If I dont go out soon, Ill never have the confidence,\" my mum confessed.So, armed with face masks, sanitiser and a sensible degree of caution, we refused to be beaten by fear.Nan chose to camp her way around the Cairngorms. But weve opted for a greater degree of comfort at the Fe Arms, a regal Victorian property in the village of Braemar on the banks of the River Clunie, matched in magnicence to its surrounding mountain landscape.After having our temperatures checked, were ushered inside by the hotels welcoming ghillies who apologise profusely for the impersonality of Perspex  on reception, visors and the absence of Fes bespoke tartan blankets in rooms.Scotland only recently emerged from lockdown on July , and the hotel Is quickly adapting to a new and unfamiliar way of working. Rooms are deep cleaned between guests, breakfast buffets have been ditched in favour of timed sittings, and a one-way system is in place throughout the property.Otherwise, it all feels refreshingly normal.Owned by art dealers Iwan and Manuela Wirth , who breathed new le into its rundown shell and re-opened in , the Fe is filled with , artworks, antiques and collectables.When youve been indoors for so long, everything has a new and shiny appeal. But here in this Disneyland of culture and creativity, my mum has the wide-eyed wonder of a child embracing infinity and beyond.Paying homage to Braemars Victorian roots, furnishings reflect the grandeur of that time: an ornately carved walnut wood fireplace depicting works by Scottish poet Robert Burns dominates the reception chairs upholstered in Liberty fabrics decorate the drawing room and natural history specimens are displayed in curiosity cabinets, or used to create whimsical tableaux in bell jars. Not to everyones modern PC tastes, one corridor alone has  pieces of taxidermy, upstaged only by an eery waxwork model of Queen Victoria in the library, purchased from Madame Tussauds.If a wall of stags heads is isive, modern artworks incorporating antlers are pleasingly palatable: hanging above the main staircase, Richard Jacksons Red Deer Chandelier is a tangle of neon bagpipe drones and glass antlers.From outspoken sculptures to understated sketches, every corner of the Fe is covered in conversation-provoking art.Works by Picasso, Brueghel The Younger and Man Ray hang on walls one of Louise Bourgeois bronze spiders straddles the courtyard. But an even more impressive find are some watercolours of royal estates painted by Prince Charles and a sketch by Queen Victoria of a stag shot by her close confidant John Brown.Braemars relationship with royalty reaches back to  when Prince Albert purchased Balmoral Estate for his sovereign we. \"She was passionate about this place,\" Katy Fennema of Braemar Highland Experience tells me. The former musician, whose family have  years of history in the area, now runs local history, wilderness and wildle tours with her husband, Julian.During a morning driving tour, she shares tales of brigands hung from tree boughs, and delights in stories of Chanels fashion rival Elsa Schiaparelli, who became fascinated with Braemar when her friend, Vogue editor Frances Lovell Oldham, married a laird. The two ladies would literally go on to paint parts of the town shocking pink, and an art deco bar at the Fe is named after Elsa.Much of the land here has been shaped by aristocracy. Patchworks of charred heather on the hillside are the remnants of controlled burns, used to boost a grouse population in time for shoots.Yet so much remains wild. Along the Queens Drive walking trail, trees are laden with tufty beards of lichen, an indicator of the airs purity.At .am one morning, mum and I ramble through the Morrone Birkwood, a relic of deciduous woodland that once covered the Cairngorms. On the way up, we watch hares and red squirrels scamper through a stadium used to host the Braemar Gathering, one of the most popular Highland Games. And we detour past the house where Robert Louis Stephenson spent a miserable, rainy three months in , emerging with the first  chapters of Treasure Island.Its a very dferent scene today. Sunlight splinters through gate pickets as we clamber onto a trail scattered with pinecones. Streams trickle melodically from the mountainside and the scent of honeysuckle is dizzying.Juniper, blaeberries, meadowsweet and yarrow - so many plants thrive in this healthy environment. Later in the day, herbalist and forager Natasha Lloyd introduces us to her open-air medicine cabinet. She recommends treatments for my mums liver, and I learn how to eat a raw nettle without getting stung. The common nettle is packed with Vitamin D, which may boost the immune system against respiratory viruses such as Covid-.Fortunately, there were no cases of coronavirus in Braemar. Although one famous figure down the road made headlines: Prince Charles self-isolated at Balmoral when he fell ill at the beginning of lockdown.Its easy to see why the royals come here to escape and recuperate. This month, the Queen will arrive for her annual summer holiday. We follow one of her favourite trails through the Ballochbuie Forest, a protected tract of -year-old pines saved from felling by Queen Victoria, leading to the Honka Hut - a simple cabin where Elizabeth II likes to picnic.In the past, hikers claim to have \"run-into\" Her Royal Highness walking the corgis, but blissfully, we dont see a soul.It was silence and solitude that guided Nan Shepherd into the mountains.

Everyone wins. And all shall have prizes.:IndyRef: New poll shows % would back independence as SNP set for record Holyrood majorityMind you, I dont think Mr Swinney will be interfering in many future examinations. I cant think of any ministerial U-turn that has been quite as humiliating as this one. Not least because Mr Swinney spent half of his statement defending the very moderation system that he had just discarded.No serious government can conduct its business in this way. Mr Swinney gave no principled explanation of why he was abandoning the work of the supposedly independent SQA ndash other than that a number young people felt that the system was unjust. That is undeniably true and we all felt for them.But this capitulation leaves the SQA in an impossible position, and brings the whole examination process into question. Indeed, I dont see how the SQA can continue in its present form. Certainly, it cannot conduct its normal moderation of exam results with any confidence in future years.And nor can Mr Swinney. He must surely go now, after this fiasco, and without delay. Someone must come in to restore respect for the standards in Scottish education and serve the last rites on the Qualications Authority.Indeed, standardised assessment through competitive examinations looks to have had its day. As Mr Swinney hinted, it has become increasingly unpopular in recent years. Though every country including Finland, the leading edge of pedagogical progressivism, uses objective testing.But after this fiasco, examinations like the Highers will surely lose their unique status and will likely be supplanted by teacher estimates of ability which, according to Mr Swinney, is the most reliable way to gauge academic achievement. This, even though he himself concedes that in the past teacher assessment has been no reliable guide to exam performance.The impact on grade inflation will be as the First Minister herself forecast last week ldquoincredible. A % increase in Highers grades means that this years students will forever be marked out as the year when exam credibility went out the window.Whoever called the process by which the Scottish Qualication Authority adjusts exam scores to reflect past school performance ldquomoderation had a dry sense of humour. It has caused fury amongst teachers, pupils, parents.The anger shows no sign of moderating even after Swinneys desperate attempt to put a lid on the worst exam crisis in  years. This was a statement that was as humiliating as it was self-contradictory.:UK falls into recession after lockdown sees record contractionHe began by explaining atwhy the moderation applied by the SQA did not disproportionately downgrade students from deprived areas, as has been widely claimed. This is because the grade inflation, against historic standards, was higher in schools in these areas, at %, than in schools in more prosperous areas, which inflated by only around %. Greater moderation was therefore applied out of fairness, not classism.He then commended the SQAs ldquoopen and transparent adjustment methodology and insisted that it was ldquoin use throughout the UK and across the world\". But, er, not in Scotland any more. Mr Swinney then let the algorithmic cat out of the bag by pointing out that exam moderation happens every year to some extent as the SQA, and its English equivalent Ofqual, manipulate grade boundaries. But not presumably in future.He even announced, solemnly, that the remit of the SQAwas to ensure that every student got ldquothe qualications they deserved. The teacher estimates: ldquo awarded without moderation, he said ldquo would have led to an increase in pass rates without precedent.Sothe methodology was so fair and robust, why was he over-ruling the independent SQA and allowing this unprecedented grade inflation to take place  Well, Mr Swinney had spoken to young people who felt ldquotheir future was being determined by statistical modelling. The credibility of exam grades was of secondary importance to ldquothe risk that people would lose faith in the system. Well, they certainly will now.But does anyone seriously think that the SQA actually marked down working class students because they were living in a deprived postcode  Of course not. The SQA anyway subjected its moderation regime to an Equalities Impact Assessment ndash as it is obliged to do ndash before it published them.Moderation by algorithm is a pretty blunt instrument and doesnt take account of inidual performance. But, as Mr Swinney says, it is very widely used. Capitulating to grade inflation of up to % may win political points in the short term, but it will store up big problems for the future.:John Swinneys SQA U-Turn: Seven things you need to knowEvery year, grade boundaries move up and down to ensure fairness and comparable outcomes. Tens of thousands of pupils have their exam results routinely moderated. The English equivalent of the SQA, Ofqual, uses a very similar ldquostandardisation model against which to correct scores which depart from the historical average.Englands pandemic moderation is, according to reports, even greater than ours ndash % of grades have been adjusted downwards from the estimates provided by teachers, against % in Scotland. We wont know the final figures until tomorrowwhen the English A level results are unveiled. But, strangely, there has not been anything like the controversy over moderation that we have seen here.The inconvenient truth is that the Scottish ldquopandemic cohort, as they are already being dubbed, has exchanged one unfairness for another. They may have got the grades they and their teachers wanted, but those grades will forever be tainted by the chaotic and unprincipled way in which they were awarded.

Leaving aside the independence issue, to leave a legacy worth remembering, it is time to throw caution to the wind.The obvious first, and probably most important example, is uppermost in our thoughts this week: education. Our focus currently is on an acute issue in the form of the exam results, just as a few months ago it was on the acute question of when children wouldto school. But those are snapshots, stories, symptoms.:Jobs guarantee for young Scots backed by poundm fundingThe real issue here is not the acute but the chronic we have a state school system which is inadequately preparing our children for the world which greets them when they leave. I have now acquired direct experience of this, with four children in the state school system.It is not hyperbolic to say that I have encountered almost nothing which has genuinely impressed me. We are living a lie in this country, blindly accepting old tropes about Scotland having a world-leading education system. We do not. It is unambitious, with very little encouragement of the pursuit of excellence. It is secretive, with decisions iniably favouring councils and unions at the expense of pupils and parents, who are often treated as an inconvenience. And it is iniquitous, with thosewho have been able to pay for a house in a good catchment area effectively purchasing a chance for our children to emerge unscathed.Education leads to economic success. Education leads to high tax receipts. Education leads to good health and wellbeing. Education reduces welfare dependency. Education is everything.

As a citizen I recognise that the SNP will be in power for the next term of government and I believe that Mr Swinney has the skill, knowledge and respect to lead a rethink of everything. Starting age. Term times. Class sizes. Curriculum. Everything. We are all invested in his success.This is true not only of education. When the story of Covid  is told, Irsquod put the mortgage on the NHS emerging from that story as the hero. The NHS, as has often been said, is this countryrsquos national religion, and the hysteria which accompanies any sceptical comment about its quality ensures that the only political intervention it attracts is no-strings-attached increases in funding.:Letters: This is the final nail in the coffin of our education systemThat is no longer acceptable. As we try to analyse, in Scotland and the UK, whether we have coped well with Covid  relative to our peers, to leave the NHS out of that discussion would be an act of national self-harm.There are facts here, and they sit stubbornly in the way of the narrative. Our NHS has  percent fewer doctors per head than the OECD average. We have barely half the average number of hospital beds per head. We have less than half the number of MRI scanners, and one-third the number of CT scanners per head.We scrape into the OECD top- for survival rates for major cancers ndash colorectal, breast and cervical. We perform even worse ndash outside the top  ndash in mortality rates for heart attack, haemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. And all of this is despite comparable financing of the system. Readers, we are not the envy of the world.This is not OK. We should stop thinking this is OK. We should stop saying this is OK. It demeans us to do so. You can support taxpayer-funded healthcare, as I do, and support the people who work in it, as I do , whilst also advocating a renewal of the delivery mechanism.However the critical first hurdle in a national renewal ndash the part we in Scotland have always found ourselves unable to leap ndash is to admit that we have problems. That we too often bask in our own mediocrity. So herersquos one idea. The Scottish Government should create a small National Renewal Unit. Give them a big travel budget.

The credibility of a nationrsquos education system is based mainly on its examination processes and is the point at which international comparisons are often made. Those looking in from abroad must draw the conclusion that the robustness of the Scottish system has vanished and, in its place, are standards that should be openly questioned.

The decision should be welcomed. But this is merely a first step to what needs to be the most fundamental reform.A claim that this decision will destroy the \"credibility\" of end of schooling certication in Scotland, because it is unfair to those who earned their grades in previous years, is woefully misinformed. There is an important historic injustice to be addressed but it is not that those who earned so-called \"good\" grades in the past have had these devalued by the awards in . It is that the SQA system that so grossly underestimated the achievements and performance of learners this year, has been doing the same thing to students, mainly from disadvantaged backgrounds, for at least  years.Evidence of predictive validity ndash the extent to which end of schooling grades correlate with subsequent performance in either higher education or employment ndash is conspicuous by its absence. If employers and universities base their admissions processes on grades earned through external examinations alone, they are truly \"buying a pig in poke\".The reductionist myth that it is possible to devise a \"national\" examination system that can accurately and fairly assess, at the end of formal schooling, the multarious skills and abilities of young people and convert these into meaningful numerical scales is plainly erroneous. The counter argument is that national assessments merely serve as an elaborate ndash but grossly unfair ndash social sorting process. This means that those with sufficient funds to live in \"leafy suburbs\", employ private tutors or patronise independent schools, can ensure the progress of their offspring to the most prestigious universities and careers.What would be a genuine insult to credibility would be a , after this year, to the previous system. It is welcome that there is to be an immediate inquiry. What this process needs to do is open to public scrutiny the assumptions and processes that have led us to this sorry state. What we do not need is another, glacially-slow-moving bureaucratic grand committee, led by the \"great and good\" and stuffed with nominees from education quangos ndash such as HM Inspectorate, Education Scotland and the SQA. The unimaginative institutional groupthink of these bodies is a major cause of the problems we face ndash they are most unlikely to spawn a solution.We should congratulate all those learners who earned their awards in this dficult year. We must also acknowledge a debt to the young people who took to the streets to protest at the injustice done to them. In this they have alerted a much wider community to the source of serious inequalities in Scottish society. It would be to betray these young people,those who can do not now ensure that this system is changed.Jim Rand, Blanefield.THE hagiographical accounts by contributors on todayrsquos Letters Pagesof the Damascene conversion of humble saint John Swinney on the road to next Mayrsquos elections, paled into insignicance against the more accurate and sober judgement of your columnist, Iain Macwhirter, who rightly identied Swinneyrsquos performance, not that of the SQA, as the fiasco .The decision by Mr Swinney, with the encouragement of his party leader, to complete a volte face over the exam results, is naked populism, based on a fear that droves of - year olds and their families might desert the SNP at the ballot box next May. It smacks of total panic and complete capitulation.An independent body of markers will, in my opinion, always be best placed to grade exam results. This is because, unlike teachers marking their own pupils, independent markers have no emotional ties with the pupils they are grading, and therefore can mark dispassionately and objectively no vested interest in the school doing well, and possibly rising up educational league tables, and use a standardised system across the whole of Scotland, not one applied dferently in each school, by each teacher, most of whom, no doubt, will have had little experience of objectively grading course work.In times of crisis, one expects onersquos political leaders to maintain a cool head in the penalty box. Instead of that, the SNP has gone into a blind panic and, at a stroke, has degraded this yearrsquos exam results and potentially put the future of the SQA in doubt.A definite \"E\" grade performance from Mr Swinney and Ms Sturgeon, Must try harder, I think is the phrase that best applies here.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.HOLYROOD has descended through farce into some form of infantile Punch and Judy Show where the aim is to score points and humiliate opponents rather than to further the interests of the general public.

Imagine the furorethe original announcement showed pass-rates had soared to the now readjusted level there would have been demands that the outrageous results were downgraded as being unrealistic and that Mr Swinney should go.Why isnrsquot the finger of accusation being pointed at the SQA for having an assessment system where the exam results are so out of alignment with the estimations of teachers in both the private and public sectors who actually know the students  One-off exams are an imperfect form of assessing ability, we all know knew ldquosmart people who were good at passing exams but who couldnrsquot put a nut in the proverbial monkeyrsquos mouth what I canrsquot understand is how so many of them end up as politicians and civil servants.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.THIS week I wrote about the inequity facing poor students whose success was capped by statistics not merit . We have now seen the Education Secretary apologise and share how long he knew about issues. Signicant issues have been facing education for some time now around assessment, inequity, culture and governance. The announced retrospective review of the most recent crisis may collate issues. These were rightly raised by academics calling out issues. Some issues sadly remain now for eternity ndash teachers judgment was questioned and some students got uplted grades because the system rewarded rich, high-attaining schools.However, where are the forward-looking improvements  Education reform in Scotland has been spasmodic and unsatisfactory. One academic suggested only a third of reforms were successful. Furthermore there is still no date for the OECD review. Why canrsquot this happen remotely  Indeed, Scottish education missed a wider opportunity during this crisis. Shts to school online learning and other much-needed reform have not taken place.

Which  is now calling for the financial regulator to take urgent steps to extend support for people who are struggling due to the coronavirus crisis to prevent millions of people from facing serious financial consequences.It says protections that are currently in place, which provide crucial support for those that are struggling, should be extended by three months until  January  to ease the financial impact on consumers when the furlough scheme ends on October , .CAS chief executive Derek Mitchell said:ldquoItrsquos essential that governments and policy makers take the right steps to

We want to see flexibility from the Chancellor so people arenrsquot pushed into unsustainable financial insecurity.ldquoThe Citizens Advice network in Scotland has seen a huge increase in demand for redundancy advice during the pandemic and we can only see that demand increasing in the months the ahead.\"Which  says that while payment holidays are not a long-term solution and it is in the best interests for consumers to repay where possible, there is likely to be a rise in the number of consumers falling into financial distress as a result of the furlough scheme ending who will need to access this support.It said lenders should offer wider \"forbearance options\" such as payment rescheduling or freezing interest when another deferral is not in the consumers best interest.The consumer organisation said it was too early toto existing forbearance rules - designed for those facing financial hardship - raising concerns that firms will be unable to offer tailored support to struggling customers.It also suggests that normal credit reference agency reporting rules should not immediately be applied after the October  deadline has passed.Anyone who has already accessed a payment holiday due to the extraordinary circumstances created by the pandemic - or who accesses one between now and January ,  - must not have their long-term creditworthiness negatively impacted as a result, it said.The timescales of forbearance complaints should be reduced so consumers can get urgent support when they need it, the consumer organisation added.Gareth Shaw, Head of Money at Which , said: ldquoThe regulator has acted quickly and effectively to help those struggling financially due to the pandemic, but it must be prepared to take further bold action to prevent millions of people from being hit by a perfect storm of financial pressures in the coming months.ldquoThe huge number of payment holidays taken highlights the scale of financial dficulty people in this country are facing - a situation that is likely to become worse as support measures like the furlough scheme come to an end.ldquoThe regulator must treat all consumers fairly - ensuring financial support is still provided to those who need it and also available for those who may face financial problems for the first time after October .The number of people in work in Scotland fell by , between April and June as the impact of lockdown hit, according to the latest figures show.The proportion of people aged  to  in employment north of the border fell over the quarter to .% , data from the Office for National Statisticsindicates.The unemployment rate rose over that period to . per cent with , people out of work.

Meetings also donrsquot have to be registeredldquofactual information or views on a topic were requested by ministers or MSPs.Members of the Scottish Alliance for Lobbying Transparencywhich includes groups like Transparency International and the Electoral Reform Society ndash have made their concerns known to policy makers to mark two years since the Scottish Lobbying Register was introduced.So far this year the number of reported regulated lobbying engagements has slumped by a quarter from  last year to just  this year.With the numbers slumping in particular during the lockdown, the campaigners fear this is simply because lobbyists are moving from in-person meetings to \"undeclared phone calls and written materials\" in the run up to next yearrsquos elections.In February alone, before the coronavirus lockdown, the number of reported regulated lobbying engagements dropped by half from  last year to just  in .An analysis of the lobbying register between March, last year and July, this year found that most lobbying of Scottish ministers has been carried out by big businesses and farmers.Ten of the top  lobbyists over the last two years represented private vested interests. They included major companies, salmon farming multinationals, supermarkets, the whisky industry and landowners.The most frequent ministerial lobbyist by far was the Confederation of British Industryin Scotland, which says it speaks for , UK businesses. The second biggest was the National Farmers Union in Scotland , which represents over , farmers.Campaigners say Scotland is \"noticeably out of step with other major Western democracies\" such as the Republic of Ireland, Canada and even Westminster, which record oral and written communications as lobbying.And unlike lobbying transparency registers in the EU and US, Scotlandrsquos does not provide any information about the amount spent on relevant activities by those seeking to influence key decisions.The campaigners say that gives the impression that there is equal opportunity for organisations and groups to present their views to ministers and MSPs when there might be a substantial disparity in their resources.That comes against a background of growing concerns over the scale of oil and gas industry lobbying as Scotland tries to move towards a zero-carbon economy, SALT said.Steve Goodrich, senior research managerwith Transparency International UK said: \"Far too much remains unknown about access and potential influence at Holyrood.\"Although the current law as drafted is a welcome step, there is still a long way to go. This provides a critical opportunity to bring greater transparency to lobbying in Scotland and bring it closer to better practice where, like in Ireland.ldquoThe current rules fall well short of international standards, and provide an obvious loophole for those seeking to avoid transparency. The definition of lobbying should include all forms of communication with decision makers, not just face-to-face meetings.\"SALT is also concerned over what they have described as the lsquoZoom lobbying loopholersquo.Under the current rules, video-calls from lobbyists would have to be declared as lobbying. Butthey turn the camera off, it suddenly becomes unreportable, and \"entirely hidden from voters view\".With such a signicant information gap, it becomes dficult to identythere has been any wrongdoing in controversial situations, SALT says.ldquoA major and concerning loophole in the current rules is that only face-to-face or video call meetings count as regulated lobbying. Counter to good practice standards, this means all other forms of written and oral communicationare withheld from public view.\"Bizarrely, as drafted, the law means that at the click of button in a Zoom call a meeting with a minister, MSP or senior civil servant can avoid regulation and the details withheld from public view. While democracy campaigners welcomed the introduction of the lobbying register, they are warning it does not go far enough in a digital age.SALT is calling for written and oral forms of communication to be covered by regulated lobbying and says that commercial lobbyists should disclose or estimate spending on campaigns.It maintains there should be an increase in the frequency of reporting to provide more timely information on lobbying activities. At present lobbying activities only have to be reported twice a year.Willie Sullivan, director of Electoral Reform Society Scotland, which is a leading member of the SALT coalition, said: ldquoThere are major gaps in the lobbying laws which are leaving voters in the dark. The Zoom lobbying loophole is so glaringly obvious that it should be closed as a matter of urgency. Ordinary voters ndash who donrsquot have millions to splash out on corporate campaigning - need to know who is targeting their representatives, and how much theyrsquore spending.ldquoScotland can lead the way in democratic transparency, but as things stands our rules are in some ways more lax than Westminsterrsquos, and need tightening to create a level playing field. We know first-hand that it would not be burdensome to regularly report how much resources are put into lobbying. Letrsquos close the loopholes and give voters the transparency they deserve.Only four of the  top lobbyists in the last register analysis could be said to represent the public interest. They were the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Scottish Trades Union Congressand charities for the blind and cancer research.Analysis also revealed that the four most lobbied ministers since March  were the former finance secretary, Derek Mackay the energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon and the rural economy minister, Fergus Ewing.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoThe operation and review of the statutory framework for lobbyingis amatter for the Scottish Parliament.ldquoIt is the responsibility of those who lobby to consider whether any engagement they have with lobbyees should be registered.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

Three Northern Ireland school principals on the controversy surrounding a covid-hit results day.Amanda McNamee, principal of Lagan College: #We#re dismayed to see our young people unsure of future pathways#This year, our school community, like all others, has experienced unprecedented levels of change and disruption since March , but throughout the Covid- pandemic, we have been extremely proud of how our Sixth Form students have coped with the situation that the education system found itself in. Students had their learning disrupted, were denied the opportunity to sit examinations and experienced serious uncertainty about their future, but throughout it all they held an unwavering confidence that their teachers, who knew their learning best, would not let them down.As a centre of learning, Lagan College agrees that statistical modelling has its place in a normal given year.However, we believe more passionately that a teacher#s knowledge of their student#s learning, continuous assessment and potential supersedes this and this has been anything but a normal school year.So, our school community feels extremely disheartened and disappointed that some of our students believe that the education system has let them down.This year, we have recorded a signicant disparity between teacher centre assessed gradesand the final grades awarded by the Northern Ireland examination board.Some % of all A-level grades awarded were reduced, % of AS-level grades awarded were reduced.Unfortunately, until we receive more information and transparency about the awarding process used for an inidual learner, we do not feel confident that grades awarded to every student were a fair reflection of their work to date and potentialthey had been able to sit examinations.We were dismayed to see some of our students upset and disarmed yesterday and uncertain of their onward pathways. However, teachers were on hand to reassure our young people and their families that all of this was simply beyond their control.Let#s now all redouble our efforts in the education system to reflect upon yesterday#s events and ensure that the wellbeing of our young people is not unnecessarily and further impacted upon this year.Alan Hutchinson, principal of Glastry College, Newtownards: #Students# hopes dashed by farce and systemic discrimination#Yesterday Glastry College students arrived to collect results full of hope for their future many excited about fulfilling their dreams by accessing higher education courses that will shape their lives and the lives of their families for decades to come. Instead, they were graced with what, at best, can be described as a farce and at worst systemic discrimination.At A-level % of our candidates were downgraded in at least one subject, while % of all Centre Assessed Grades were adjusted downwards.The statistical modelling used by CCEA appears to have taken no account of any work completed, or progress made by students in the seven months they studied during this academic year up until lockdown.Over the last five years our internal tracking data has indicated that we have predicted the overall A-level outcome for students to within -% either way.However, based upon the grades awarded by the examining body this year, our predictions appear to be out by an incredulous %!The question arises, do we trust and value the expert judgment of teaching professionals who have many years# experience, know the students as iniduals and have access to multiple sources of reliable assessment and tracking data, or data scientists who are more interested in decidedly limited and dubious data than the devastation caused to students, parents and teachers Statistics aside, we are dealing here with young people, with human beings, all of whom have hopes and aspirations, many of which are now dashed on a system they were promised would not disadvantage them.Moreover, the policy to go into lockdown appears to have dealt a signicant blow to those deemed to be least in need of the protection afforded by it.On top of this, we must acknowledge the trauma this cohort of pupils has already suffered.The opportunity to showcase their ability, skills, and knowledge acquired and developed over the last seven years was stolen.Their school career abruptly ended with no time for farewells or celebrations.Further anxiety was added by the enforced separation from their peers due to lockdown.Now, instead of aiding and supporting these pupils, CCEA has compounded this emotional distress, predominantly it seems, in non-selective schools by permitting what is nothing short of an incongruous travesty.I sincerely hope that immediate and rectying action is taken in the interests of all the young people unjustly penalised this year by a very flawed system.Gary Kelly, principal of St Kevin#s College, Lisnaskea: #My excitement turned to upset when I saw the pupils# grades#With over  years of teaching experience and  years as principal, yesterday was one of the most upsetting results days I have experienced.After arriving in school on Wednesday excited about downloading the A-level results, this quickly turned to upset when I had seen how many pupils# grades were marked down at A-level.I was expecting, as St Kevin#s College was ranked as the highest performing non-selective school in  and second highest non-selective school in , that this year#s A-level results would follow the student cohort pattern from when these pupils were doing GCSEs one or two years ago. But no - approximately % of Year  A-level pupils had A-levels downgraded with the CCEA exam board. The picture with other exam boards was better than this, down slightly.It was with a heavy heart that I awoke this morning to release grades and speak to pupils and parents.Normally I take delight chatting with pupils and parents on results day and congratulating them, but not this year.I was consoling them and offering a shoulder to cry on and a possible hope of an appeal to help their well-being and mental health, with the knowledge that this could take weeks and months to sort out -ever.In all my years as principal I have never had to deal with so many upset pupils and parents as this year.I understand this is a very dficult process to estimate A-level and GCSE grades with the Covid- outbreak.But why ask teachers to spend days and weeks examining past pupil work, holding standardisation meetings online and socially distanced in school, and entering marks for the majority of the teacher predictions to be downgraded as we did in our school and most schools across Northern Ireland It is not all doom and gloom - the vast majority of our pupils have got their first preference course at university, which is good, our three A*-C pass rate is up on last year.But what we have discovered is that it is the high performing pupils# grades that have been downgraded most and that Northern Ireland CCEA exams have been downgraded more than any English exam board.Pupils are saying you know me Sir or Miss - I am much better than these grades. Look at my exams in school, my coursework, my GCSE results.They say: I might have got into university but I have to carry these results for the rest of my le and put them down on every application form I write - what does this say about me. I have had lots of parents and pupils in tears today - normally we get four to five appeals on a normal exam result day. This year it#s more like  to .I don#t often complain, but when there is such an injustice, I feel we must speak out for our young people both hear and across the whole of Northern Ireland.

B is not a bad grade at all but I was just hoping for the A because I needed it.

However, he said the problem was not within the remit of the council, and added pressure had to be put on Stormont to deal with it.Residents believe the air pollution is connected to an industrial site.People Before Profit councillor for Michael Collins said the situation was very worrying. It#s going back as far as January last year and there have been complaints from all parties, he said.He said the odour was detected across the Colin area, which includes Dunmurry, Ladybrook, Lagmore, Poleglass, Stewartstown and Twinbrook.He told the committee: Even yesterday I had people ring me from Willowvale and from Lenadoon, which is on the opposite side of the constituency. In fact, it#s not just Belfast, it#s also affecting Lisburn. The council there are also looking into this issue.It is very serious, particularly when you consider one in  deaths in Belfast, according to the Centre for Cities Survey, is related directly to air pollution. We have to do something urgently to address this and to get to the root of the problem.He proposed the Colin area be targeted in the council#s Belfast air quality action plan, which was set up to monitor particulate matter and other harmful substances.The committee unanimously agreed to Mr Baker#s motion, which will go to the next full meeting of Belfast City Council for ratication.This is the second time in less than a month that Belfast residents have kicked up a stink about a stench.Last month people in the north of the city complained about a mountain of illegal waste that had built up in a unit at the Edenderry Mill complex on the Crumlin Road and nearby derelict land.Clouds of flies forced residents to keep doors and windows closed.There were also complaints about rats.Belfast Most ReadBrexit will lead to united Ireland in  years, says Sinn Fein#s O#NeillNorthern Ireland Centenary: Nothing to celebrate for nationalists, says O#Neill A Level results: Northern Ireland#s students and principals #shocked and angered# as exams board lowers % of gradesShock as BBC NI axes popular traffic and travel bulletins #out of the blue#Coronavirus Northern Ireland: R number rises to . as A Level results controversy rumbles on,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen.

In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This is unacceptable, has reducedthe future options for many school leavers and caused immense distress. Teachers’ assessments should have been trusted much more than they have been.

It is not good enough.“The SDLP first raised these issues with CCEA and the Department of Education many months ago.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr McGurk added: “This program aims to help local families reduce the cost of purchasing unorms. “However, we are relying on the generosity of the local community to donate items of unorm which are in good condition and are no longer needed by their own family. “We would appeal to all families whose children have moved out of school, or outgrown items of unorm, to donate to the program at any on the drop off points advertised in social media.” googletag.cmd.push Once items are received and sorted, families will have an opportunity to book an appointment to pick up items they need at Benbradagh Community Support or Hands That Talk.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Along with drivers of internal combustion enginecars using EV charge points as makesht parking bays, EV drivers listed poor maintenance of the existing network as a major problem. Phil Gordon, a Donegal resident who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, said the majority of the city’s charge points are not ing. “It’s been slowly falling apart for years and nobody is doing anything about it. It was developed around -,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I got my EV in  and at that point, in Derry alone there were seven standard chargers and one rapid. At the minute there are only two of the slow chargers left working. “There one on Carlisle Road has been broken for as long as I can remember. There is one in the Diamond that has been out of order for about  or  months. “We’ve been told by eCars that it’s beyond repair, they can’t fix it and there is no plan to replace it. The north west in general has been very badly served by eCars for a long time. googletag.cmd.push “You look at how many there are in Belfast. It’s the biggest city and it has four or five rapid chargers. Derry is the second biggest city in the country and it’s only ever had one.” A map showing EV charge points across County Derry. Responsibility for the network across the island of Ireland lies with eCars, a specic section of Electricity Supply Board . The company began charging last year for the use of its rapid chargers in the Republic of Ireland and further pricing for standard network charging points came into effect yesterday. ESB have said they hope to be able to replace broken chargers, but that ‘planning issues’ are causing a delay. “In County Derry, there are  chargers in total each with two charge points. Of these  are working correctly and our systems indicate recent usage,” a spokesperson said. “There are, however, a number of chargers in Derry City which have faults which cannot be resolved, and new chargers are required. “This is due to the age of the equipment and that they are no longer supported by the original charger manufacturer. “In addition, one charger was removed at the train station due to building works and which is due to be reinstated in coming months by the building contractor. “ESB ecars has plans to replace a section of the existing Standard AC network in Northern Ireland including in Derry. “There are a number of planning issues which need to be resolved first and work is on-going with relevant stakeholders in relation to it at present. “It is hoped that these issues can be overcome with a view to beginning to replace chargers in the coming months.” At present, it is free to charge an electric car using the Northern Ireland network, something EV driver Ronan McElholm feels leaves the system open to abuse. “They’re free, and this is half the problem. When you get something that is free, it’s subject to abuse,” he said. “There is a lot of funding from the government in the Republic, but added to that is the fact you’re now having to pay for it and it makes things easier. “It’s not a fortune to charge your car. It’s only slightly more than the day-time rate. It keeps the freeloaders away because it’s now cheaper to charge at home than on the network.” While the lack of maintenance on the network has caused problems, EV drivers are also having to contend with ICE drivers using the charge points as parking bays. “A lot of places, they’ll put a charger in but don’t enforce the parking, so people park an ordinary car in it because it’s a handy space and they leave it there,” said Phil Gordon “There is no punishment for that. In Derry City, you will get a ticketyou’re parked in an EV charging bay, but a in lot of places, that’s not enforced. “It’s ridiculous. They call it ‘ICE-ing’. Internal Combustion Engine. If they’ve parked an ordinary car in your place, you’ve been ‘iced’. It’s such a common problem there’s a term for it. “You wouldn’t park a car at a petrol pump and walk off and leave it. That’s the equivalent.” Ronan McElholm regularly travels from Derry to Belfast and Dublin for work, and has encountered the problem on numerous occasions. “It causes a problem. I was going to Belfast, finding an abandoned car on a charger with no way of knowing when this person is coming back,” he said. “I’ve never had any issues with the rapid charger on the Glenshane, for example, apart from non-electric cars parking in it. One day there was a van parked and left there for three hours. “Once you hit five o’clock, non-electric cars just park in it, which is an incredibly selfish thing for anyone to do. “They can get a ticket for it, but once the traffic wardens go home, there is no one to ticket you, because the police say it’s not their responsibility. “In the Republic, they are upgrading all the street chargers to rapid chargers, which is a good thing, but unless there is proper policing on it, people just pull in and park. “It needs a change to legislation and the police need powers to ticket cars parked on them.” DfI Minister Nichola Mallon arriving for work in her EV. The political lag caused by Stormont’s two-year period of stalemate has resulted in a backlog across all departments which has delayed any upgrade to the EV charging network. Department for InfrastructureMinister Nichola Mallon raised eyebrows when she arrived in an EV on the day Stormont ed in January. “That was a show. People like myself have tried to contact her to get something done about it and they just don’t reply. All talk and no substance,” said Phil Gordon. “When I got my first Leaf in , there were only about ,-odd cars in the whole of the Republic of Ireland. Now there are about , in the south and -, in the north. “The users are there, but bureaucracy and red tape has left it way down the list of priorities to get the network to a al level.” “They really would need to get their finger out,” added Ronan McElholm. “They certainly do need to get things moving with regards to legislation. The complete charge network needs and overhaul and massive funding. “As an electric car user, I’m prepare to pay for it like it is in the Republic. They’ve really started to upgrade the network there in the last few years, but you can see a big dference.” The UK government has committed to banning the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles from . The DfI have said they are engaging with the UK Office of Low Emission Vehiclesto ‘determine how to meet this challenge’. A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department provides advice and guidance in relation to electric vehicles, working closely with OLEV. “The Department is working to identy actions to support the decarbonisation of transport including how best to support the uptake of ultra-low emission vehicles to the Northern Ireland market. “The Minister has engaged with the DAERA Minister to begin working collaboratively to promote the use of electric vehicles and specically to improve the charge point network in Northern Ireland. “She is committed to exploring all options and new solutions to enhance the charge point infrastructure, improve lives and tackle the climate emergency. “The DfI continues to closely monitor funding opportunities for the installation of additional charge point infrastructure. “We will work with commercial providers to ensure that the installation of any additional charge point infrastructure remains fit for purpose commensurate with growth.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The poll, conducted before the NI Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face coverings compulsory from yesterday, indicated that .% would be in favour of the move. When askedthey would comply with a ruling to make face coverings in shops compulsory, the amount of positive responses increased to .%. % of respondents who listed Maghera as their nearest town or village indicated they would not complythe wearing of face coverings was made compulsory. googletag.cmd.push The survey also found that a large majority of residents in the county are already in possession of a face covering. .% of respondents indicated that they had either bought or been given a face covering since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic. Of that number, the most popular setting for wearing a face covering was the supermarket, with % of respondents indicating they had worn their covering there. Petrol stations and local shops were the next highest on .%, with hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons close behind on .%.  Just % said they had worn a covering on public transport, where they have been compulsory since July , while .% of those who took part in the survey said they never wore one. googletag.cmd.push Asked to comment on face coverings, many of those opposed to wearing one said they didn’t feel it would have any impact on the spread of the virus. One respondent said: “I really dont think they are necessary. Wearing them is not effective. Hand washing  social distancing are the best preventative measures. Others felt the issue should be a matter of personal choice, with one respondent stating, ‘it should be a choice, not an order’. “If it’s not safe enough to go out without a face mask then its not safe enough to go out period. The number of people with ill-fitting masks is unbelievable,” said another. “Gaping holes, noses uncovered, constantly adjusting them with their hands are all defeating the purpose of the masks.”  Protecting the vulnerable was a motivator for many of those who were in favour of mandatory face coverings. “We should protect each other as best we can. Currently the advice is that face masks help prevent the spread of Covid-, so take responsibility and wear one,” said one respondent. Some also felt that coverings should have been mandatory since the start of lockdown, while others who are shielding said the lack of face coverings makes them anxious. “I dont see enough people wearing them coming out of shielding myself,” said one respondent. “I feel really unsafe and anxious about going into enclosed places as it is with my mask on so when people are not wearing them it concerns me and my safety.” As the requirement came into force yesterday, the NI Executive launched their ‘Wear One For Everyone’ campaign, stressing the move was to make things safer for everyone.  A joint statement said: “The use of face coverings is a vital defence in our battle against Covid-. “This is about looking after each other and doing everything we can to stay on top of this virus. It will help to save lives. “It also has to be remembered that some people cannot wear face coverings, due to a disability or health condition. “There should be no stigma attached to anyone in these circumstances. If those of us who can cover up do so, then it will help keep everyone safe. “We are confident most people will comply, but those who do not wear a face covering without a reasonable excuse risk being issued with a fixed penalty notice by the police.” Mid Ulster MLA, Emma Sheerin, said making face coverings mandatory was a positive step. “I welcome the move to make face coverings mandatory, and I think that we all should be doing whatever we can to minimise risks to ourselves and others,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

The Latvian event is the first loose surface event of the ERC season and despite fluctuating travel restrictions around Europe, the event has attracted a strong entry and Devine will start the event at number  in the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy entered Hyundai i R. Despite limited loose surface experience in the  wheel drive Hyundai, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy are looking forward to seeing what they can do in Latvia. googletag.cmd.push “Obviously Italy was a disappointment but thankfully the car has been repaired. I need to put that behind me now”, Devine said. “I’ve only had a little bit of loose surface experience with the Hyundai so at the moment my preparation has been about watching onboards but we have the official test ahead of the event which will be a help. It’s going to be a bit of a challenge but we knew from the start of the year this would be the toughest event, just because it’s something we are not used to. Myself and Brian both did Finland a few years ago as part of the Junior World Rally Championship and it wouldn’t be too dissimilar, but that was in an R car, an R car is so much faster! From what I’ve seen the rally looks really good and the stages look nice but it’s a place where you wouldn’t want to get it wrong because it’s so high speed. googletag.cmd.push A lot of the guys will be quite used to it having done it before andyou are not on it from the beginning, you can get left behind very quickly. But we have to start somewhere, that’s how we are looking at it this year. I also have to remember that I need points on the board.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Customer Racing Junior Driver programs also saw him take in Rally di Alba recently. “It was great to get out straight after the disappointment of Rome and especially on such a star studded event. It was also interesting to run with a new team for that weekend which was a great experience and I’m very thankful to Hyundai Motorsport Customer Racing for setting it up, he added. Callum and Brian will be partnered in Latvia by  other all Irish crews in Hyundai’s. Craig Breen and Paul Nagle will tackle the event as they continue their development of MRF tyres while Cathan McCourt and James Fulton will join Callum is the PCRS camp. “When you’re abroad, it’s nice to have a few competitors from home around too, it helps you relax a little”, said Callum. Rally Liepāja will begin on Friday, August  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle  stages before a further  stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just over km  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to

not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my

Most of Europe was basking in a heatwav and race morning arrived with temperatures already at  degrees.The race statistics were scary with , metres of climbing to be covered in only .km race distance. The lsquowallrsquo to the finish line had a maximum gradient of an eye-watering %..In the early stages Hanna found himself in the leading group of five with the cream of the Italian mountain racing scene.Included in the quality field were lsquovertical kilometrersquo specialist Henry Aymonod, Davide Magnini, one of the best uphill and sky runners in the world, former European mountain racing champion Martin Dematteis and Frenchman Sylvain Cachard.At around half distance Aymonod put in a surge and Hanna tried to follow with Dematteis being ped from the group.On to the upper slopes and Hanna was at the back of the group of three in fourth place. Then with less than m nearly vertical metres to go, he surged past Cachard to move into thirrd place and crossed the line in  minutes and  seconds. The winner, Aymonod, was home in : with Magnini second in :. Hannarsquos training regime, which included running upwards of  miles a week near his home on the Slieve Croob, gave him the strength to tackle back-to-back races.So after the lung-bursting steepness of Saturday, Sunday morning at :am brought the challenge of the Fletta Trail over close to half-marathon distance with climbing and descending back to the starting point in the village of Malonno.Francesco Puppi, the local Italian favourite and second in the World Long Distance Championships in Patagonia last November and world champion in , was in the race, fresh after not racing on Saturday.Seasoned Italian international Cesare Maestri was also in the field and he too had not raced the day before.As the race set off, these two were joined at the front by Francersquos Sylvain Cachard. Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness.

Yesterday, the prime minister announced the establishment of a Centenary Forum and Centenary Historical Advisory Panel to help shape our programme of events to mark this important national anniversary for the entire United Kingdom. We will work with a broad spectrum of people and voices, including those from the political parties, business, tourism and the voluntary and community sectors to deliver an ambitious and exciting programme of events. The Historical Advisory Panel will provide expert insight on the historical facts and themes of this period, encouraging wider engagement with, and reflection on, our shared history.Despite the many challenges it faced over the course of the twentieth century and a long and dficult journey to the peace and prosperity it enjoys today, Northern Ireland has a wonderful, rich and vibrant cultural and industrial heritage.Since my appointment over a year ago, I can personally attest to the warm welcome and hospitality which is offered all across Northern Ireland, no matter who you are or where you come from.We believe the centenary of Northern Ireland represents a huge opportunity for us to look towards a shared and more prosperous future for all of us, as one United Kingdom. This anniversary will allow us to showcase Northern Ireland as an attractive place to live, visit and do business and reinforce its position at the forefront of global developments in science and technology — from the ingenuity of firms such as Wrightbus and Stratospheric Platforms, to the expertise of the Centre for Secure Information Technologiesat Queen’s University Belfast.Northern Ireland is a truly special place — and we intend to make this a memorable centenary that we can all be proud of, as we celebrate all that is unique about Northern Ireland and look ahead to its bright future.• Robin Walker MP is minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos not only the right thing to do, itrsquos in our best interest.ldquoUnless every country has access to Covid- vaccines and treatments, the whole world is at risk.The Janssen vaccine, which is being made available on a not-for-profit basis, is expected to begin the next phase of clinical trials later this year and will look at whether two doses can provide long-term protection from coronavirus.Meanwhile, Novavax plans to make some of its vaccine at Fujilm Diosynth Biotechnologiesrsquos facilities in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east of England one it is available.The Government said thatthe Novavax and Janssen vaccines are proven safe and successful in clinical trials they could be delivered to the UK in mid-.The vaccines would first be given to priority groups such as front-line health workers, those with serious diseases, the elderly and ethnic minorities.Publishing weekly data on Friday, the Office for National Statisticssaid while recent figures had suggested the percentage of iniduals testing positive for Covid- in households in England had risen slightly in July, this trend now appears to have levelled off..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: UK reaches agreements on access to m doses of potential Covid- vaccines article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports.

facilities at GosfordNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPoliticsPlan for  homes in Portadown gets green lightA controversial plan for a further  houses to be built near Lisnisky Lane, was approved at August’s meeting of Armagh, City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s planning and regulatory services committee.By The NewsroomThursday, th August , : am\"\"The outline application lodged by agent Alan Patterson Design Ltd, on behalf of applicant Sustar Ltd will see approximately  dwellings and a crèche built on lands to the east of Bracken Lodge Lisnisky Road and Lisnisky Lane.The development of this . acres site will be delivered in phases, each of which will require further planning approval.There are also conditions attached to phases withplanning officers wanting to ensure plans for the proposed crèche are submitted and approved by the Council by the time the th dwelling is approved.The crèche must also be completed and operated prior to the occupation of the th house.This is to ensure that the community facility approved within the application is provided.One of the conditions attached to this approval will ensure a two lane approach to roundabout  is submitted to and approved in writing by the Council and this work shall be completed prior to the occupation of  households.The outline proposal also includes a new access point to these lands to be created approximately m south of No  Lisnisky Lane.The application has receiveda total of  letters of objection from four separatepostal addresses and one letter of support.Speaking against the proposal on Wednesday afternoon, Councillor Margaret Tinsley said she was not against the application for new housing but was very concerned about “traffic congestion in the area at peak times”.“Prior to COVID, traffic was queuedback from roundabout  to roundabout  already so how will these roads cope with potentially another , cars,” said the DUP representative.“Any improvement the Department for Infrastructureare to make to the roads need to be in place now, not when the houses are built.“I am not against these new homes totally I just want to ensure these traffic problems do not escalate further.”Speaking on behalf of the application, SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson reminded the committee the lands are already zoned for housing.“These proposals are for very high quality development, there will becrèche facilities on site and homeowners will be able to walk to local places of employment.“This fits in with the singular concept of Craigavon and will be a great boost to the local economy with development costs of over £ million.“I understand the concerns around traffic but I trust the DfI engineers have done their job and I commend the developer and the team working on this proposal as they have clearly worked hard to come up with this excellent proposal.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson identied traffic congestion as the biggest bugbear with regards to this application and asked road service how they had got to the point where they are happy with the application.A member of Road Serviceinformed the committee that a transport assessment had been submitted as part of the application and was found to be acceptable.“A range of road improvements are being delivered with this application in a phased manner, including a link road to Old Lurgan Road and a two lane approach to roundabout ,” said the DfI representative.It was also revealed that traffic management modelling showed Craigavon’s roundabout’s worked in isolation but when joined together, the problems stemmed from the hospital roundabout junction.“This was passed on to my colleagues in development control and it was their decision to accept what was presented,” said another DfI representative.Following questioning about the condition of Lisnisky Lane from Councillor Peter Lavery, Council’s case officer in charge of the report advised this application was an outline application.“In future applications access will have to be considered and no development shall commence until work has been carried out at roundabout ,” said the case officer.“Proposals for a new access to the hospital have been submitted this week but that has to go through due process we can’t take for granted that will be approved when considering this application.”Alderman Sydney Anderson said he saw this development as an opportunity.“As the development is being built I would like to think Road Service would take on board the need to develop the road network as well,” said the DUP representative.Sinn Fein Councillor Paul Duffy describedthe area as “growing” while his party colleague Councillor Garath Keating said it was clear that traffic was a problem in the area but didn’t feel this was the developer’s fault.“I don’t think we can lay the blame for traffic problems on a new development,” said Cllr Keating.“If you are going to use traffic problems as a reason to refuse this application it would be very prejudicial on availabilityof new housing.”Councillor Peter Lavery said he was in agreement with this assessment but was mindful of the need to continue to monitor road use as the dferent phases of this application were submitted.Ulster Unionist Councillor Sam Nicholson said there was work to be done with this application.“The traffic problem is not a unique problem and I don’t think we can blame the developer for that, the onus is on the Department to future proof the road network,” said Councillor Nicholson.SDLP Councillor Mealla Campbell said she had been reassured by all she had heard and proposed accepting the outline application.This proposal was seconded by Councillor Paul Duffy and committee members voiced their agreement.Speaking on behalf of Sustar, development consultant Michael Hannath welcomed the positive decision for this application which he said will be very signicant for the local area. He said: “Demand for new homes in this location remains very healthy and our agents have already received direct expressions of interest from over  parties for future housing in the next phases since the first phase at Bracken Hall was completed.”Michael went on to point out that the application has already gone through a rigorous planning process and has been subject to a wider environmental impact assessment and subsequent comprehensive environmental statement. As part of that process, he said, there have been detailed traffic assessments carried out and important input from a multi-disciplinary team of competent experts led by planning consultants Oriel Planning. Detailed surveys and reports have been carried out in Traffic and Transport, Ecology, Hydrogeology, Geology and Soils, Drainage and Flood Risk, Noise and Vibration, Air Quality and Contaminated Land and Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment. In addition, community consultation events have taken place at which feedback has been received and taken on board. He said: “Some local residents have objected to the proposal because of concerns that they believe increased housing will add to an already congested stretch of road between the Lisnisky Lane roundabout and the hospital roundabout and heading into town. The main concerns appear to be around traffic congestion at peak am times particularly where we have the merging of traffic from the two-lane carriageway into a single lane coming from Craigavon direction and heading towards the hospital.”Michael pointed out: “Numerous consultations with Dfi roads over the past three years have informed the proposals and detailed design considerations have been integrated in order to address these concerns. The development team are confident that the development meets the design requirements and policy set out by Dfi Roads and this has been confirmed by Dfi roads in their final consultation responses. “The current proposal includes the widening of Lisnisky Lane at the approach to roundabout . There will be a flare lane added at the bottom of Lisnisky Lane for traffic turning left towards town which should reduce the traffic backing up in this area and permit traffic flow coming down Lisnisky Lane to go around the roundabout and head out of town.“In addition, the approval has a condition which requires the delivery of a second access to the lands before the occupation of the th house.“Sustar have been working with Dfi Roads and the Trust to assist with the delivery of a suitable option and a design for a new roundabout on Lisnisky Lane at the back entrance to hospital has now been finalised.“The developer has been working with Dfi roads and the Trust to facilitate the delivery of this for some time now and we understand a planning application is expected to be lodged imminently by the Trust. The proposed roundabout approved will provide a new well needed second access to the Hospital, a realignment of Lisnisky Lane heading to the old Lurgan Road and a connection into the development lands. This roundabout would greatly relieve the peak hour traffic congestion.”Michael was keen to point out that the positive economic impact of this development is “very signicant for the local economy. It will generate employment and jobs across a iety of disciplines, construction jobs, both skilled and unskilled as well as jobs in the materials supply and marketing sectors”. In total the development costs of this housing scheme are estimated to be in excess of £ million at present day costs “with a consequential inflow of benefits both financial and social into the local and wider economies”.
