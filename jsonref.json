Why are they called that?Here is everything you need to know…The Empire Windrush arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica (Picture: Getty Images)The Windrush Generation is a term describing the people who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971.It garnered its name from the ship HMT Empire Windrush, a former German troopship acquired as a prize of war, which was the first to carry workers over from Jamaica in 1948.It landed at Tilbury Docks, Essex, in June of that year, carrying 492 passengers and a number of stowaways.Immigrants from Jamaica arrive at Tilbury, London, on board the Empire Windrush in 1948 (Picture: Getty)This was the first in several boat trips over the next two decades, and is not known how many people belong to the Windrush Generation as a whole.People began moving over from the Caribbean after a call from the UK for more workers in industries such as agriculture and mining.In short, they were invited to help the country which was struggling after WWII.The petition is gaining momentum (Picture: parliament.uk)The Windrush Generation is cut off at 1971 as that is when the Immigration Act came in.This allowed Commonwealth citizens already in the country the option to stay indefinitely.Any people yet to move to the UK had to have a work permit and prove that a parent of grandparent was born in the UK.The immigration was poorly documented and the Home Office did not keep accurate records or issue paperwork to those with the right to remain in the UK.Jamaican immigrants welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship HMT ‘Empire Windrush’ landed them at Tilbury (Picture: PA)This has not been a problem for years, but those without documents are now being told that they are necessary if they want to work, use public services or just live in the UK.Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary,  said there was ‘absolutely no question’ of the Windrush generation’s right to continue to live and work in the country.‘People should not be concerned about this – they have the right to stay and we should be reassuring them of that,’ she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Barbados high commissioner Guy Hewitt told the BBC: ‘I have held as a great honour the fact that I am the first London-born high commissioner for Barbados.‘This is the first time I have felt that the country of my birth is saying to people of my region “you are no longer welcome”.’Labour has called a public meeting with affected people on April 19, while Prime Minister Theresa May has issued an apology to the Windrush Generation.Meanwhile shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ‘The treatment of the ‘Windrush generation’ of migrants who came from the Caribbean is scandalous.‘Many came here as children, their parents invited to the UK to work. They have been here decades, worked and paid taxes, set down roots and created families of their own. This is their home.‘But the Government is treating them as illegal aliens. They are denied the free NHS care they are entitled to or even threatened with deportation. This must stop.’MP David Lammy described the Windrush scandal as ‘a day of national shame’.MORE: Seven inmates killed after eight-hour riot at prison holding some of America’s worst criminalsMORE: Planet Earth just survived an asteroid sneak attack – but we might not be so lucky the next time"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pjimage-141.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;crop=1","title":"floss dance created everyone","story":"The floss dance began on Instagram and now everyone is flossing away (Pictures: InstagramITV)Just when you thought you were getting the hang of the dab, a brand new on-trend dance move comes along.It’s called the floss dance, and if you want to be down with the kids you better learn how to do it.Unfortunately, it requires a lot more coordination than the Cha Cha Slide or the Hokey Cokey. Or any moves from Flashdance.But hey, if a stern-faced child known as ‘the backpack kid’ can do it and seem cool, surely you can as well? Here’s the low-down on the floss…After building confidence, you can also bring in other moves with your arms if desired, but this is not mandatory.The floss dance originates from an Instagram-famous American schoolboy, 16-year-old Russell Horning, known as the backpack kid.Back in the summer of 2016, Russell’s dance videos began to include the floss, so it’s taken a while to build this level of buzz.Dele Alli attempts the dance to mark his 22nd birthday (Pictures: Snapchat)Fans of the backpack kid started to copy his moves and the floss became his signature dance.Then in May 2017, Russell – who now has nearly 2 million Instagram followers – was invited on to Saturday Night Live to perform his dance alongside Katy Perry when she sang her tune Swish Swish.Celebs who have now attempted the dance include Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown, Tottenham ace Dele Alli and GMB’s Kate Garraway and Charlotte Hawkins.Why is everybody doing it?

Pictured above is a cobblestone street that split into two causing a cart to fall into the gap caused by the earthquake          Another striking image reveals the fires that broke out after the earthquake, showing the sky filled with smoke as the fires roared high above public buildings, as people stared helplessly at the relentless blaze. Pictured above are residents overlooking downtown San Francisco as the fire rips through the city          The massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Northern California coastline, at precisely 5.12am local time on April 18th. Pictured above are people gathered following the quake as the fire continues to burn in the city          Although, the earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created, so the magnitude is an estimate. Some experts estimate the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3. Pictured above is a horse drawn fire engine in front of the Harbor Emergency Hospital and the Union Ferry Building is in the backgroundThe earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created - which didn\u0027t happen until 1935 - so the magnitude is an estimate, but some experts believe the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3.The extent of the intense shaking was felt from Oregon, to Los Angeles and even as inland as Nevada proving its undeniable strength.The epicenter of the earthquake was predicted to be offshore, in a north-westerly direction of the Golden Gate Bridge as a minor local tsunami was recorded by a tide gauge in a nearby location.In the immediate aftermath of the quake, 375 deaths were confirmed, however, the total is thought to be up to 3,000 deaths making it one of the worst and deadliest quakes in the United States history. That death toll also remains the greatest loss of life in the state\u0027s history from a natural disaster.

The destruction of the quake and the ensuing fires is estimated to have cost roughly $350 million – the equivalent to $8.97 billion now.For the past few years, scientists have predicted a big earthquake could hit California at any moment and a new report from the New York Times states that \u0027at least 100 buildings taller than 240 feet were built in areas that have a “very high” chance of liquefaction\u0027 if another large quake hits San Francisco.  Royston Leonard colorized the original images using Paint Shop Pro X2.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. GDPR: All you need to know Rob Kardashian \u0027begging Khloe Kardashian to dump Tristan Thompson during NBA playoffs\u0027International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrencyNational Lottery: EuroMillions results for Tuesday, 17th April 2018 Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

Shortly after take-off we heard a loud noise and the plane started shaking like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced before.\u0027It sounded like the plane was coming apart. It was terrifying,\u0027 she said. Phillips shunned glory, hailing others who tried to help as \u0027heroes\u0027.\u0027Andrew and I ran the CPR, he was just the most courageous young man. We had a lot of, I don\u0027t consider myself a hero by any stretch, but there were heroes on that plane. I was just doing my job. Andrew was doing his job. \u0027I just did what I do.

She later became an instructor, as the Navy did not allow women to fly in combat, and she finally resigned in 1993 when she joined Southwest Airlines.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics   The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia.

It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The National Transportation Safety Board says a preliminary examination of the blown jet engine  shows evidence of \u0027metal fatigue.\u0027In a late night news conference, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades was separated and missing. Sumwalt says the blade was separated at the point where it would come into the hub and there was evidence of metal fatigue. He said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. Horrific accident caught on camera leaves three deadPrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave HarryBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental torture\u0027The mouth is for eating\u0027: Uganda\u0027s president warns against oral sexGeorgia woman attacks pregnant soldier at restaurant and gets arrestedRuth Smeeth gets standing ovation for anti-semitism speechFormer First Lady Barbara Bush dead at age 92Terrifying moment surfer is mauled by four-metre great white sharkTwo surfers have been mauled by great white shark just hours apartDrug smugglers caught at Heathrow trying to move £16m of cocaineAlfie Evans\u0027s father front row of Pope\u0027s weekly general audienceSouthwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing.

Fact.\u0027 Meghan’s half-sister appears to be left off the guest list along with her brother Thomas Markle Jr, his ex-wife Tracy and their children Thomas and Tyler Dooley. Today Meghan met youth delegates taking part in this week’s high-profile Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm) in London. It is unusual for someone who has not yet married into the royal family to be involved in a high-profile occasion such as the Chogm summit.But the Queen, who is Head of the Commonwealth, has made clear she sees Harry and his future bride as lynchpins of her work with the so-called ‘family of nations’. Miss Markle, 36, who has given up her acting career to devote herself to being a full-time royal, has no previous links to the Commonwealth, but has worked with the UN as a women’s advocate for Political Participation and Leadership and undertaken several humanitarian missions.     Ms Grant initially expressed excitement at the prospect of being invited the the Royal wedding          Ms Grant called the decision to not invite members of the extended family the \u0027elephant in the room\u0027          She claimed that no-one had been invited to the Royal wedding so far from the Markle familyMs Grant has also confirmed she is writing a book about her half-sister.In the past, she claimed to have raised Meghan for 12 years when she was growing up in California.But other sources speculate that the pair had little to do with one another.The Palace announced last Wednesday that world leaders and politicians would not be included on the list of those attending the wedding.US President Donald Trump, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and the Obamas have not been invited to the wedding.But they invited an extra 1,200 members of the public to the castle for the celebrations as reward for their community work. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/14/4B47DBFA00000578-0-image-a-108_1524059151952.jpg","title":"Presenter Fern Britton pays touching tribute mother Ruth","story":"    Fern with her mother Ruth in an image she uploaded to Twitter after she died aged 94          She also posted this picture and a touching tribute to her mother describing her as \u0027funny and ferocious\u0027It\u0027s healthy for children to see their parents row, says...Share this articleShe added: \u0027So brave and uncomplaining.

Elan-Clan\u0027s lawyer said the current system has forced people to deny a fundamental part of their identityHowever, legal representatives for the Home Secretary argue that the current policy does not \u0027interfere\u0027 with rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.In written submissions, the Home Office argued that the current gender policy was necessary to maintain security and to combat identity theft and fraud, and \u0027to ensure security at national borders\u0027.  Home Office lawyers added that a change in current policy would \u0027create a huge administrative burden. There would be associated financial costs.\u0027 Elan-Cane said in a statement before the hearing: \u0027Legitimate identity is a fundamental human right, but non-gendered people are often treated as though we have no rights.\u0027The UK\u0027s passport application process requires applicants to declare whether they are male or female.\u0027It is inappropriate and wrong that someone who defines as neither should be forced to make that declaration.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/16/4B48950900000578-5630539-image-a-44_1524065842405.jpg","title":"GDPR need know","story":"    The GDPR, General Data Protection Regulation, compliance deadline is fast approachingWith over 87 million users estimated to have had their data mined through the ‘This Is Your Digital Life’ quiz, it has also emerged that private Facebook Messenger conversations may have also fallen into the hands of Cambridge Analytica. But what is GDPR?What is GDPR?The General Data Protection Regulation has been created over the course of four years in order to strengthen data protection in an era in which people are continuously giving social media websites permissions to use their personal information in exchange for ‘free’ services.GDPR will be replacing the Data Protection Act 1998, which itself was brought into law so that the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive could be implemented and give people more control over how organisations use data.The regulation also introduced penalties for those who do not comply with the new rules and in turn, suffer from data breaches. It also standardised all data laws across the European Union.A significant change in the new regulation is that if companies fail to provide adequate security to protect data, they could be fined heavily under GDPR.Why do we need GDPR?  The advent of the Internet and the emergence of the cloud led to organisations being able to use personal user data for their own purposes, which caused problems when iniduals wanted to know how their information was being used.  GDPR was planned because of the EU’s need to align data protection law with the 21st century, a time where people use free services like Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook and offer their information openly.Alongside this, the EU wanted to align data protection law across all member states so that companies are clear about what they need to comply with.          The General Data Protection Regulation will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member statesWhen will the GDPR be implemented?The GDPR  will apply from May 25, 2018 in all EU member states automatically, without the need for each country having to draw up their own legislation.While businesses have until May 25 to ensure they have applied the new rules, the directive came into force on May 24, 2016 after the EU agreed to the final text.Who does the GDPR apply to?GDPR will apply to those who decide how and why personal data is processed, the controllers, as well as those who actively process the data, otherwise known as the processors. This means that GDPR could apply to anyone working in a company, charity, government or IT firm.It will also apply to controllers and processors that are based outside the EU, but deal with data that belongs to EU residents. Controllers are responsible for ensuring that processors abide by the new law and process data lawfully, who themselves are required to maintain records of their activities.After the GDPR is put in place, data must be processed with consent and transparently, for a purpose and once it is no longer needed, data should be deleted. Alongside this, consent must be granted in an active fashion by the user, not passively with pre-ticked boxes.What is personal data?Under the GDPR, the European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other online identifiers such as IP addresses, mental health, cultural and economic information about an inidual.Iniduals already have the right to access information that a company has obtained and to know how and why their data is being processed, as well as who will see it. Data can also be rectified, changed or deleted at any time by the person it belongs to.          The European Union has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include other identifiersHow much are GDPR fines?When a data breach occurs, the people who are at risk of being affected must be told within 72 hours of the company being aware of it. Those who do not meet this deadline could face a penalty of two per cent of their annual worldwide revenue, or €10 million (£8.7m), whichever is higher.Then, the data protection authority should be contacted and in the UK, this means the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, or the ICO. The authority should be given information about the nature of data breach, how many people have been affected, what the consequences could be and what measures have been actioned.If people’s rights are ignored, the fine could reach up to €20 million (£17m) or four per cent of your global annual turnover, whichever is higher.Does Brexit affect GDPR?With Article 50 being triggered in March 2017, the UK has two years in which to leave the European Union, but this means that the GDPR will be implemented before this time. In August 2017, the UK government put forward a new Data Protection Bill, which replicates the requirements of GDPR ahead of Brexit. The new bill allows the ICO to issue fines of up to £17 million, or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is highest.GDPR: All you need to know Rob Kardashian \u0027begging Khloe Kardashian to dump Tristan Thompson during NBA playoffs\u0027International Champions Cup 2018: Fixtures, dates, teams and ticketsJohnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrencyNational Lottery: EuroMillions results for Tuesday, 17th April 2018 Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

Diaz-Canel would be the first non-Castro to hold Cuba\u0027s top government office since the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro (pictured) and his younger brother RaulRaised and educated in the city of Santa Clara, Diaz-Canel graduated from the local university in 1982 and performed three years of obligatory military service. In 1987 he joined the Young Communists\u0027 Union. He also went on to work as a professor of engineering at the University of Santa Clara and travelled to Nicaragua as part of a government-run mission to support that country\u0027s socialist revolution.Santa Clara residents remember him wearing his hair long and openly admiring the Beatles, who were frowned on by ardent communists who considered the group as representative of the decadent culture of Cuba\u0027s capitalist enemies.Nonetheless, the young professor was named first party secretary in Villa Clara province in 1994 and gained a reputation as a hard-working public servant with a conspicuously modest lifestyle. Residents said that Diaz-Canel was the first official they remembered who didn\u0027t move to a new government-provided home after accepting the position of first secretary.Diaz-Canel travelled the city on a bicycle during the economic crisis spawned when the fall of the Soviet Union cut off subsidies for Cuba, and he accepted visits at all hours at his home and office from residents with complaints or suggestions.When he finished work, residents said, he would start his shifts with the local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, a mix of a neighbourhood watch committee and local militia.\u0027Some comrades didn\u0027t want to put him on watch because he would be overwhelmed with work, but he would say, \u0027\u0027I\u0027m a citizen of this country and I\u0027ll stand watch like anyone else,\u0027\u0027\u0027 said Liliana Perez, whose house faces the  home where Diaz-Canel lived with his wife and two children.          The proposal is subject to a vote later in the day by the national assembly and the result will be formally announced on Thursday. Pictured: Diaz-Canel on Wednesday          Diaz-Canel had been seen at greatest length in a leaked video of a Communist Party meeting where he sombrely pledged to shutter some independent media and labelled some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversionIn 1996, he began appearing on a local radio program during which he would take two hours of live phone calls from people complaining about problems ranging from bad state restaurants to pothole-rutted side streets, radio journalist Xiomara Rodriguez said.In a country where the state controls most daily activities, Diaz-Canel also made surprise visits to government-run establishments such as the local funeral parlor to check on the quality of services.Diaz-Canel also became known for pushing back against the intolerant tendencies of the Communist Party, an organisation with strains of deep social conservatism and conformity.Canada recalls diplomatic staff and their families from Cuba...Blind leader of Colombia\u0027s Revolutionary Armed Forces is...Share this articleAs first secretary of Villa Clara, he was an active supporter of El Menjunje, a cultural centre that hosted rock \u0027n\u0027 roll shows and became a focus of activities by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Cubans, including some of the country\u0027s first drag shows. Diaz-Canel was known for bringing his children to the club, an unusual assertion of support in a society with deeply rooted antipathy toward homosexuals.Two of Diaz-Canel\u0027s children have gone on to play in Polaroid, a well-known Cuban rock band.In 2003, Diaz-Canel was named first secretary of the eastern province of Holguin, where he ran into complaints.           Diaz-Canel also became known for pushing back against the intolerant tendencies of the Communist Party, an organisation with strains of deep social conservatism and conformitySome say he focused too much of his six years in office on beautifying the city centre while neglecting the needs of poor and working people. In 2003, Diaz-Canel was also named to the Communist Party\u0027s Politburo, one of its highest-ranking bodies. Six years later, he was named minister of higher education and was praised for modernising curricula and introducing computer technology to many university programs. He was also known as one of the first high-ranking officials to bring a laptop to government meetings.In 2012, conservative Communist Party officials shut down \u0027Young Cuba,\u0027 a blog run by young academics at the University of Matanzas who supported Cuba\u0027s socialist system but who criticised corruption, inefficiency and resistance to change.Diaz-Canel called a meeting between the university rector and the blog\u0027s founders and pointedly asked them, \u0027What do you need to keep running \u0027Young Cuba?\u0027\u0027 The blog was unblocked and remains an important forum for debate among Cuban intellectuals calling for gradual reform. Diaz-Canel also intervened when a government official denied a travel permit to the U.S. for Humberto Rios Labrada, a sustainable agriculture expert who won the U.S-based Goldman Environmental Prize, said Gregory Biniowski, a Cuba-based Canadian lawyer who nominated Rios Labrada for the honour.As first vice president he has mostly stayed out of view, but many observers see that as a wise strategy for survival in a system run by ageing revolutionaries who have ended the careers of many young politicians who rose to prominence early in their careers.   The reign of the Castros: How brothers Fidel and Raul led a revolution and controlled Cuba for decades As Raul Castro passes the presidency on to his mentee, Miguel Diaz-Canel, it marks the end of the reign of Castros at the helm of politics in Cuba.Raul became president in 2008 when his older brother, Fidel Castro, formally handed over power as his health deteriorated. Fidel died in 2016 aged 90.The brothers overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, were exiled in Mexico and survived a disastrous start to their rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana on January 1959.At age 32, Fidel became the youngest leader in Latin America and put his younger brother Raul in charge of the armed forces.           Brothers Fidel (left) and Raul (right) Castro overcame imprisonment at the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, were exiled in Mexico and survived a disastrous start to their rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana on January 1959          Despite initial setbacks, the bearded guerrillas operating in the eastern mountains steadily gained support across the country. Pictured: Fidel is seen with his brother Raul Castro (left) and Camilo Cienfuegos while operating in the Mountains of Eastern Cuba in 1957 Despite initial setbacks, the bearded guerrillas, operating in the eastern mountains, steadily gained support across the country. On January 1, 1959, Batista fled and Fidel became the unquestioned leader of Cuba, with his younger brother put in charge of the armed forces.Fidel\u0027s government initially executed or imprisoned many foes, and veered to Soviet-backed socialism in the early 1960s.Cuba backed revolutions across Latin America, and while most of those failed, the Castros\u0027 resistance to U.S. domination inspired millions across the continent and beyond.Fidel\u0027s control survived repeated U.S. plots to overthrow or kill him, and even the hardships that followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, which had kept the island\u0027s economy afloat.But illness finally forced Fidel to turn over power in 2006 to Raul, who formally became president two years later.Raul announced that he will step aside as president in April - though he plans to remain in what is probably a more important position: head of Cuba\u0027s lone permitted party, the Communist Party.           But illness finally forced Fidel to turn over power in 2006 to Raul, who formally became president two years later.

When will the industry tackle its failings?The year is 1971. In London, Robert Morris’s Tate show, Bodyspacemotionthings closes after four days because viewers, encouraged to climb over its adventure playground-style structure, have become too boisterous. In New York, the Whitney Museum faces a huge backlash for appointing a white curator for its Contemporary Black Artists in America exhibition. Meanwhile, Linda Nochlin’s essay Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists is published to the delight of campaigning feminists everywhere. She argues not that women artists aren’t great, but that their greatness has been overshadowed and ignored by a canon comprised almost entirely of men. Its publication is a watershed moment, one that shakes the lofty and complacent art world to its core. Forty-seven years later, much has changed. Female curators are now commonplace within national museums and galleries the head of the Tate is a woman, Maria Balshaw and there is a much greater awareness of the way women artists have been marginalised over the years. However, there is one aspect of visual arts that remains overwhelmingly male (and white): criticism. As Jerry Saltz, megawatt showman for New York magazine, receives his deserved Pulitzer win for his art criticism, it is worth taking note of the absence of female art critics who are similarly feted. Despite numerous female winners of the Pulitzer prize for criticism specialising in architecture, TV, fashion or film, the last – female art critic to win was Manuela Hoelterhoff of the Wall Street Journal, back in 1983. Since then, little has happened to dislodge the notion that men are the cultural gatekeepers. From John Ruskin’s enthusiasm for JMW Turner to Robert Hughes championing Lucian Freud, male art critics have been invested almost exclusively with the power to make or break entire artistic movements, shaping the cultural legacy of generations and deciding whose work is worth celebrating – and collecting in museums. So where are the women? Rosalind Krauss, Lucy Lippard and Griselda Pollock, all feminist art writers well known in their fields, largely write for academic and specialist titles rather than the mainstream press. At the other end of the spectrum, young UK-based art critics Gabrielle de la Puente and Zarina Muhammad are dedicated to making art criticism accessible and ersifying the structures of the arts industry. They make the case for a new brand of art criticism, as concerned with Love Island as it is the White Cube’s latest offering, and their success without the patronage of the mainstream press is laudable. But it speaks volumes about the kind of voices national titles are willing to give status to. Meanwhile the lead art critics for the Sunday Times, the Washington Post, the Independent, the Telegraph and the Guardian are all male. Laura Cumming at the Observer, Rachel Campbell-Johnston in the Times and Roberta Smith, co-chief art critic at the New York Times, are rare examples of female critics given a broadsheet platform. It’s not as though the visual arts industry is devoid of women – in fact statistics point towards a gender disparity in the opposite direction: arts, design and history graduates are overwhelmingly female. Yet the art press is still a boys’ club.  The problem must lie in an arts and media landscape that sees men as the voices of authority. Feminist art collectives the Guerrilla Girls and Pussy Galore, and art theorist Hito Steyerl have all attested to an art world still in the heavy grip of patriarchy. Like a bad rash, the effects of the arts industry’s problem with unpaid labour are catching. With the majority of unpaid work being taken up by women, is it any wonder that they are turning away from a career in arts criticism for more stable work elsewhere? Add to this the reduction of space for arts criticism in many newspapers, and common microaggressions like mistaking female journalists for PR assistants, and the circles of access for women art critics get smaller and smaller. Despite important work by people such as Taylor Renee Aldridge and Jessica Lynne – who have highlighted the significant lack of black art critics – the issues have been ignored, erted and at worst, forgotten. Unwelcoming and certainly not inclusive, it points at an art press seriously out of touch with the modern world.At a time when barriers in other branches of the arts are being dismantled – from Kendrick Lamar winning a Pulitzer to Beyoncé’s historic headlining set at Coachella – the art world is lagging badly behind. It’s about time arts criticism began to assess its failings. In the harsh light of a year dominated by the revelations of the #MeToo movement, Nochlin’s legacy remains a troubling reminder of the work that still needs to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a991fd62798f90eb6935fb361c442e3aa221d94/0_0_1600_1042/master/1600.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e08ca9ac8f963ace794ecfee304613dc 3000w","title":"the last town in sovietland vorkuta russia tomeu coll in pictures","story":"Up above the Arctic Circle, 40 hours by train from Moscow, sits the Russian city of Vorkuta.

Seven other people were injured. The pilots of the twin-engine Boeing 737, travelling from New York to Dallas with 149 people onboard, were widely praised for showing “nerves of steel” after they took the plane into a rapid descent and made a successful emergency landing in Philadelphia.  Passengers said oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and they were instructed to brace for impact, leaving some in tears, while others shouted encouragement. In a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, the captain, Tammie Jo Shults, reported that there was a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.A passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, from Corpus Christi, Texas, said a man in a cowboy hat had rushed forward a few rows to grab Riordan and pull her back in. “She was out of the plane. He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,” he said.Images of the plane on the tarmac showed a missing window and damage to the left engine, including part of its cover. A piece of the engine covering was later found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia, the National Transportation Safety Board said.The NTSB said a preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of metal fatigue. A full investigation is expected to take 12 to 15 months. The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009.David Gleave, an aviation safety investigator based at Loughborough University described the incident as a “completely freak event”, caused by an unlikely series of coincidences, each of which would have to be examined in detail. “Why did the engine fail? Why did the engine fall apart? And why did the blade get thrown forward out of the engine and hit a window? It’s an unfortunate series of things, but that’s what we need to get to the bottom of,” he said.Gleave said the engine’s metal cowling, or cover, should have prevented any parts flying out. Design flaws, manufacturing or maintenance issues were all possible explanations for what happened, he said.Passengers said Shults walked through the aisle and talked with them to make sure they were OK after the plane had touched down. “She has nerves of steel,” said Tumlinson. “That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”The US transport secretary, Elaine Chao, said the pilot, crew and others onboard had prevented a greater tragedy. Shults was among the first female fighter pilots in the US military, according to friends and the alumni group at her alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene University.Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York, said everyone had started shouting to brace for impact when the plane prepared to land. “I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed. And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”She said she was seated near the back of the plane asleep, when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Bourman said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask but added: “You had a few passengers that were very strong and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this’.”The airline said in a statement that the fatality was the first of its kind inSouthwest’s 51-year history and extended its sympathy to all those affected.Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said there were no problems with the plane or its engine when had been inspected on Sunday. Nevertheless, the airline announced on Tuesday night that it would inspect similar engines in its fleet over the next 30 days as a precaution.A Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine in 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16 inch (12-by-40cm) hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely. The NTSB said a fan blade had broken off, apparently because of metal fatigue.Gleave said the cause of the 2016 incident was still to be fully determined, but now that it had reoccurred there was greater urgency to do so because there were 2,000 737s in the air at any one time.Riordan, from New Mexico, was the vice-president for community relations at Wells Fargo bank, working with non-profit groups. The Albuquerque mayor, Tim Keller, said the city had “lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be9d82a842308afb3703c2e10a95085e8e5781a6/0_176_5271_3163/master/5271.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a944ac8e59cf212ef9db2308953cea6e 1240w","title":"opinion polls unreliable banning elections","story":"Pollsters have been getting it wrong a lot, of late. Among their most recent forecast failures: the 2015 Tory majority, the 2016 vote to leave the EU, the 2016 Trump win, the 2017 Tory close shave. Each wildly wrong prediction left “respected” pundits eating their words, as well as many other things they had oddly promised to eat live on air – a hat, a book, an insect – as if deciding this was the moment to propel themselves, with resignation, into the “I’m a Celebrity …” phase of their careers.Efforts by British polling companies to sort themselves out have not worked. The “shy Tories” thought to explain polling errors in 2015 had somehow improved their self-esteem too much by 2017, causing the opposite error. (In their defence Tories have always maintained that they are not shy but simply very busy, unlike their Labour counterparts who will typically hang about at home all day hoping for a call from a pollster or someone selling PPI.)So now the House of Lords has decided to take the matter into its own hands. Its committee on polling and digital media has called for the polling industry to “get its house in order” or else the case for banning polling in the run-up to elections “will become stronger”. It wants to monitor methodologies and to review polling performance after each general election.This would all be very well were it not for the fact that recent prediction problems are likely not the fault of the polling industry. Because when it comes to predicting how people vote, this may be as good as it gets. A paper by Will Jennings of the University of Southampton published in Nature, which looked at polling over the last seven decades, found that polling has not in fact got worse in recent years. And there is general consensus that you can reduce bias and anomalies, but, as one pollster put it, “you can’t abolish the laws of probability”. Polls are good at sensing a national mood, but their margins of error – about six percentage points – make them bad at anything much more precise. In other words, using polls to work out which party is ahead in a neck-in-neck election race is like using Google Earth to measure your food portions, or Boris Johnson to run your Foreign Office: they’re simply the wrong tool for the job.But threatening to ban them in the run-up to elections is the wrong move too. The last few elections have roundly proved that in a week without polls the media will turn to whatever omens and portents are closest to hand: Twitter, rally attendance, even, in the case of US columnist Peggy Noonan, the number of Mitt Romney lawn signs they had recently walked past. And if you want a sense of what happens to party campaigns when official polling is scarce, look at the use of “private polling” in byelections, and see these deeply suspicious predictions on the front of party literature, often depicted in touchingly unmathematical bar charts. Ban polling in the run-up to elections, and you might as well go ahead and ban all discussion of the state of the parties, too. Polls are the best we’ve got.If new rules around reporting are introduced, we must take care how we do it. In France, a polling commission forces newspapers to declare when a polling company they quote doesn’t use official methods. But some suggest this makes predictions worse, as companies are put off from trialling new and innovative ways of polling. Regulation isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s a good first step.• Martha Gill is a freelance political journalist and former lobby correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2655dee1ddb9dcc4a31d914fb0313d190a815a9/0_95_4024_2415/master/4024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34793f825841e79ebbf7db8b0df7c79f 1240w","title":"political platitudes have masked cruel policies time to stop swallowing them","story":"Rightwing politicians spout rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree, while we wait for a catastrophic injustice to expose the realityThe politics of the platitude – the statement with which no reasonable person could disagree – has been dominant for at least the past 20 years. Who doesn’t want zero hunger? Who thinks education is bad? Who doesn’t want clean and sustainable energy or responsible, pro-social businesses? Who wants poverty entrenched, children from poor families to have no aspirations, opportunities for only some, inequality to thrive and some people to be treated as worth less than others?The language became so anodyne and meaningless that we had to look for the sense of it in the cracks, in the things that went unsaid. What did “lacking aspiration” really mean? Did it mean a person didn’t want a good life, or just that they weren’t middle-class enough? How was it that all unfortunate circumstances were driven by their hapless or feckless victims, and there were never any other factors? Why, when everybody was against inequality and for human rights, did equality get further away, and “human rights” become the new “red tape”, amorphous, troublesome, indistinct, someone else’s idea?In tandem with the new discourse, where everybody wanted the same thing – better, less impoverished lives for all – and all that was left was for decent people to choose between a suite of practical options, the actual decisions meted out by politics have become cruel. The “hostile environment” for which Theresa May is rightly castigated today has become the norm not just for immigrants, but for everyone who falls short of what the “decent citizen” of her conception should be. Anyone economically unproductive, unless they are old anyone insufficiently healthy, unless they are in the Paralympics anyone who doesn’t belong here, a category whose dimensions have become theoretically limitless, now that the criterion for belonging is that you can prove you belong, yet the Home Office holds the proof and is liable to destroy it at any moment, for “data protection”. It transpires – who knew? – that not every stamp of politics does want the best for everyone. Being unable, under the 21st century’s Convention on What’s Normal, to admit to not wanting the best, instead rightwing politics has reconfigured what it means by “everyone”.There’s historical precedent, sure, for conservative politicians not saying what they mean. Margaret Thatcher famously wanted to solve her disputes in the industrial heartlands by just putting a wall around Liverpool and leaving them to it. Even though this view was pretty well understood at the time, it took the release of historical cabinet papers before anyone could stick it on her. But the new element, the shiny modern bit of our predicament, is the sluggishness: we’re aways waiting for the hostile environment to explode into human tragedy, for a man to be refused cancer treatment, for a woman to be deported, for a hunger strike, for a suicide, always waiting for a catastrophic injustice to have a face, before we can say “this is unjust”. It’s not a collective amnesia, where we have forgotten what justice looks like, or a sudden, generalised lack of sincerity or compassion. It’s just a logical consequence there’s no space to argue about principle, because everyone claims to believe the same thing. So we wait and see what it looks like in practice. This has the pleasing scientific veneer of an evidence base, but is destructive to the lives capsized in the process. We need to stop buying it: stop swallowing the rhetoric with which no reasonable person would disagree. Then we might see the meanings beneath it in time to halt the consequences rather than bemoan them.“Am I being unreasonable?”, asked a woman posting on Mumsnet. That would have been the moment to look away. The answer is always either: “No, that’s fine, though it’s quite unreasonable that you wasted my time by asking,” or: “Unreasonable doesn’t even begin to cover it, you are so boilingly unhinged that someone should tattoo you with a warning sign or stripe you yellow and black like a bee.” But I had got as far as the subject line, whence there is no escape, like a spell invented by Tolkien.A mother of three was complaining that her husband, having started a job, had announced he needed “full personal assistance” in the morning. I assumed it was a sex thing, but no: he needed his keys and his wallet laid out, and his shoes and suit neatly arranged, unless he was cycling, in which case he wanted them in a bag, but she wouldn’t be informed of his method of transport until such time as she’d already done the other thing. Responses ided three ways: “If my husband said this, I would laugh in his face” “I used to have a husband like this, then I left him and my current husband is much nicer” and “How disappointing, I thought this was going to be a sex thing.”The outrage was superb – I want to say comradely or supportive, but no, it was just so vividly enjoyable. If someone had suggested forging the man’s Brompton into stocks and setting him there in a town square, I would have been in. Any one of us would have been. Which all made me feel a little sorry for the great villains of the internet age, the Zuckerbergs, the Russians trolls, the many facilitators of a social rage that previously didn’t exist.

Often people can act on implicit bias in prejudicial and discriminatory ways without even realizing it, such as assuming a black man is less qualified for a job than a white man, despite having similar résumés and skill sets.While the line between implicit bias and explicit bias can become murky at times, the Starbucks incident is a clear case of explicit bias and to call it anything less is outrageous. To consciously pick up the phone to call the police on two black men sitting at a table doing nothing is an explicit act.What is more concerning than how this incident is being represented to the masses is the willingness of non-profits and social justice organizations to discuss overt discriminatory incidents through the lens of implicit bias. Implicit bias frames offer these organizations an ability to discuss race in a disarming, nonthreatening means because the idea is implicit bias affects everyone’s minds unconsciously and no one is safe from its grasp.There is some validity to this argument. However, the concerning part is when implicit bias workshops – which rely heavily on social psychology to understand and overcome our brain’s unconscious racial biases and stereotyping – are offered in place to mask explicit and structural bias qualifiers that form racial violence and attitudes. As such, implicit bias workshops have become nothing more than a neoliberal PR stunt for both corporations attempting to avoid legal liability, and race organizations seeking to be solutions and funding-oriented. It’s an easy out when genuine solutions to racial violence are much more complex, time-consuming and expensive.In the Starbucks case, consider that Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), has been brought on as one of the “experts” to develop the implicit bias workshop curriculum. The ADL is a staunch supporter of Israel and advocates against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which calls for an end to Palestinian occupation. How ironic is it that ADL is involved in a racial bias workshop while supporting Israel’s policing and oppression of Palestinian people?Additionally, the ADL has sponsored exchange programs that allow Israel’s military to provide training to US law enforcement officers. During a time when Black Lives Matter is galvanizing against the militarization of police and an end to police brutality against black and brown bodies, this is a grave oversight. These are the politically charged structural-level issues implicit bias work is deflecting from. Because it makes people uncomfortable.The ways by which neoliberalism has co-opted social justice work is not new though. Most recently, Cornel West called out Ta-Nehisi Coates for being the “neoliberal face of the black freedom struggle”. Coates’ contribution to mainstreaming the black narrative is undeniable. Yet West has very valid critiques of Coates’s work that apply to the emerging implicit bias field as well. West underscores “any analysis or vision of the world that omits the centrality of Wall Street power, US military policies and the complex dynamics of class, gender and sexuality in black America is too narrow and dangerously misleading”. This is where implicit bias workshops fall short – in both analysis and vision.There is a place for recognizing the critical role of implicit bias in racial disparities it’s just not here. Bottom line – don’t be too quick to label Starbucks’ racial implicit bias trainings a victory. It’s far from it. The process for change is uncomfortable and if it’s not, then it’s probably not working."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ccc227688b4527a344250d8b7c6498691f5bd1f/106_610_3198_1918/master/3198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=afcc4acaa0aec1a295099a14775b0123 1240w","title":"british girl wins gold medal at international maths competition","story":"Emily Beatty from King Edward VII school in Sheffield came joint-first among 200 teenagersA 17-year-old Briton has won a gold medal in an international mathematics competition, becoming the first UK entrant to achieve full marks. Emily Beatty, who attends King Edward VII school in Sheffield, came joint-first among nearly 200 teenagers who took part. She was one of only five competitors to get a perfect score of 42 out of 42.The British team finished third of 52 in the European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad, which took place in Florence, Italy.Her teammates Alevtina Studenikina, from Cheltenham Ladies college in Gloucestershire, and Naomi Wei, from City of London Girls’ school, won silver medals for their scores. Melissa Quail, from Longsands academy in Cambridgeshire, won a bronze medal.The team was chosen by the UK Mathematics Trust (UKMT), a charity set up to advance young people’s education in maths.Speaking the day before the competition, Beatty and her teammates explained why they loved the subject. Beatty said she has always found “elegance in doing mathematics” and that she likes the way “structures weave into each other”. Studenikina said: “I find Olympiad-style mathematics questions interesting because, even though they do not necessarily seem to have useful applications, principles and skills obtained from solving them help solve real-life problems.”Quail said she enjoyed solving maths problems as they allowed her the freedom to use her imagination and creativity.Speaking to the Times Education Supplement, Beatty’s maths teacher, Graham Harvey, said that older pupils could be good role models for young mathematicians.“Probably the biggest impact on Emily was from one of our former students, another girl, currently at Cambridge studying maths,” he said. “We have always encouraged our older students to help us run clubs for the younger ones. Emily herself is currently mentoring one of our year 10 students. We also have a significant number of female maths teachers in the department.”Linda Gooden, the headteacher at King Edward VII school, said: “As a headteacher, I alongside all the other staff in school are really proud of Emily’s success and achievements. We always encourage staff to develop and enhance depth of mathematical understanding from an early age. We are really pleased with Emily’s achievements and know her parents will be proud too.”Rachel Greenhalgh, the director of the UK Mathematics Trust, said: “The team demonstrated their outstanding problem-solving skills and it is great to see their mathematical potential recognised.“I thank all those involved, from the maths teachers who support our activities and the UKMT volunteers who run them on our behalf, to our sponsors and supporters, in helping make this possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d67ee8bfc87dc037d2bb3b900dad29472045355/14_39_2986_1791/master/2986.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ca0162241e3c8c4b8b95b74ccc5cf5a 1240w","title":"inclusion in education works we must respect it","story":"It was my great privilege to lead an inclusive secondary modern school in the selective nightmare that is Lincolnshire (Forcing schools to abandon inclusion leaves us all poorer, 16 April). We actively welcomed those with complex social and emotional needs, and our school community benefited enormously. Clive (not his real name) had Asperger’s. Everyone got\u0026nbspto know him. Everyone recognised his difference.By educating all about Asperger’s, it was possible for Clive\u0026nbspto be himself and be accepted. We learned more from him about the autistic spectrum than any course any of us attended. He blazed a trail\u0026nbspso that staff and students could welcome those with the other alphabet soup of conditions that demand inclusion but are so often met with intolerance and exclusion.Through careful support and reasonable adjustments, and alongside our sensory impaired students, we were able to ensure that opportunity was given to all to fulfil themselves and become the best that they could be.My successor has, due to curriculum changes and budget restrictions, cut back on the availability of courses appropriate to need and removed the support network integral to the success of inclusion. The school is no longer an inclusive one and a light has dimmed in that particular part of the county. I know that this is happening across many schools in England.Inclusion works. It enables understanding, empathy and tolerance. Our education system is moving further away from these qualities that are fundamental to the development of a cohesive society. What trouble are we storing up for ourselves consigning so many to such an experience? What hope do we give them for the future?Martyn TaylorNewark, Nottinghamshire• Fully inclusive schools are vital not only for children with attributes that fall outside the ever-narrowing, exam-grades-driven “norm”, and for their peers, but also for society as a whole. Without the real understanding of human difference with which proudly erse schools endow their pupils, how are the adults whom these children become going to make a good society?Employers and recruiters need to understand what people can do and make adjustments for anything they can’t do in the usual way employees need to work well in erse and inclusive teams and customers need to make their train journeys, do their shopping and enjoy their coffee among a ersity of fellow customers who reflect the population – with no one excluded. Dr Jane FrancesCambridge• John Harris is right to say that central government policies are abandoning inclusion as an educational principle. As he says, this is not entirely a product of education policies but also due to the starvation of funds for local government. However, the problems for education that most directly affect children with additional (special) educational needs is more deeply rooted in the poverty of purposes and ideals for education. Education has become a commercial and technical enterprise and lost touch with humanity. Unless that can be restored we are all the poorer.Dr Simon GibbsNewcastle on Tyne• Forcing schools to abandon inclusion indeed leaves us all poorer. In 1978 the Warnock report was published and the “integration” movement received a boost. The 1981 Education Act made provision for pupils to be educated in mainstream schools. Further progress was made as the statutory assessment process took off and an increasing number of children received statements outlining their special educational needs (SEN).There were always tensions between the identified needs of a child and the budget available to meet those needs, but a high proportion of children with SEN were educated relatively successfully in mainstream schools. The rot began to set in with the reporting of test results, compounded by Ofsted assessments that moved more and more to analysis of schools’ performance. Children with SEN were the losers as the drive for higher test results led schools to adopt the kind of unethical practices outlined by John\u0026nbspHarris.The squeeze on schools’ funding, together with a change in legislation that has had the impact of making it harder to identify and meet children’s needs, has resulted in the deterioration in the quality of educational provision offered to those with the greatest needs. Linda RheadLondon• Your piece on families crowdfunding to take legal action against special needs cuts (Report, 14 April) is both sad and immensely worrying. There is an elephant in the\u0026nbsproom, which I describe as the values inherent in leadership decisions. The leadership roles are in central government, in local authorities and in schools.There are academy executive heads commanding salaries of three to four times the general pay and conditions salaries for a headteacher. Schools are “choosing” to reduce the support for struggling pupils and seeking to shed the blame, while the proliferation of school leadership roles for people who do not teach continues. In local\u0026nbspauthorities, there is a vacuum where there were once assistant directors and advisers with leadership roles that had SEN and schools’ overall quality as their focus. Chief officers are making cuts to local services while earning more than the prime minister does. At the level of central government, there is a lack of moral principle in both education and in\u0026nbsphealth.Dr Mic CarolanWigan• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.comletters"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b88cca3c973ed7bfe5d3eea9a4505e45d0550d/0_29_886_532/master/886.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9e10b7fa5d255f6f7533440dd3fdaea 1240w","title":"balkan dam projects could result in loss of one in 10 european fish species","story":"Exclusive: Plans for a network of hydropower plants in three countries would cause ‘chain reaction’ for endangered species, report warnsNearly one in 10 of Europe’s fish species will be pushed to the brink of extinction by a constellation of hydropower plants planned in the western Balkans, new research has found.Eleven endemic species would be wiped out, seven more would be critically endangered, four types of sturgeon would be devastated and the number of endangered species would double to 24, according to the University of Graz report.Prof Steven Weiss, the paper’s author, told the Guardian: “It is the largest systematic construction plan with negative environmental impacts that I know of, since world war two.”Weiss said: “The high density of what is being planned affects everything in the region. It transforms whole river systems into a series of reservoirs that need to be flushed. It breaks up migration corridors, and drains and isolates wetlands that have a dramatic effect on birds. There is a whole chain reaction.”The 11 fish populations most at risk are: Cobitis jadovaensis Alburnus vistonicus Delminichthys jadovensis Delminichthys krbavensis Phoxinellus dalmaticus Telestes polylepis Telestes turskyi Telestes ukliva Knipowitschia mrakovcici Eudontomyzon hellenicus and Zingel balcanicus.These are all endemic to the Balkans, Europe’s most important bioersity hotspot for molluscs and fish.One EU official told the Guardian that the study “should give us pause for thought. It’s clearly not possible for everyone’s plan to be built. Otherwise, you’re just pouring concrete over the entire region.”RiverWatch, the conservation group which co-commissioned the research, estimates that 2,800 hydropower plants are planned or under construction in the region, more than a third of them on Natura 2000 sites.Just three pristine waterways – the Neretva basin, Morača and the upper Drina system – alone host around 50 endangered and protected fish species.The countries through which they flow – Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro - are all investing in hydro, in a bid to meet the EU’s clean energy targets before joining the bloc, even though research suggests that hydropower annually emits as much methane as Canada.“This is one of the very painful activities we have to go through,” the EU source said. “These countries have plans for hydro to align with the EU’s rules on renewable energy but it is a sad state of affairs. The alternative for a number of them is not solar or wind, but coal and particularly, lignite.”The EU’s leverage over countries not yet in the bloc was limited to offering guidelines on standards, although technical assistance for environmental protection might also be considered, the official added.Ulrich Eichelmann, Riverwatch’s chief executive, said: “This report proves that Balkan rivers are the fish paradise of Europe. At the same time it is unbelievable that in the 21st century, hydro investors and politicians are risking this enormous natural value for something they call ‘green’ energy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48969322d7c394dee4e0acea35f722b60f3d6853/0_918_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18d4e063b828dcddd33bdbbc65cd5add 2600w","title":"stella mccartney designer ethical fashion interview","story":"The designer’s ethical stance made her a style outsider – but now the industry is finally catching up. Ahead of a new V\u0026ampA show, she talks about reclaiming her name, the joy of nature and the trouble with fast fashionStella McCartney is a designer, a businesswoman and an environmental activist, but of the three, she says, fashion will always come first. “It has to, you see. Because the only way for me to start the conversation I want to start is by making a product that you want to buy and that you are going to spend your hard-earned money on. If the product is rubbish, then there is no conversation to be had. If I don’t have a successful business, then I’m an environmentalist who happens to be Paul McCartney’s daughter, and that is a conversation which lasts about three seconds. No one is going to come back for more of that chat.”McCartney is at the V\u0026ampA in London for the launch of Fashioned from Nature, an exhibition opening on Saturday that tackles the complex relationship between fashion and the natural world. In other words, the very axis McCartney has been obsessing over for two decades. She was an outlier when she launched her cruelty-free, sustainably minded brand in 2001, but has found the centre of gravity shifting in her direction. “When I was younger, just saying you were vegetarian at someone else’s dinner table wasn’t often a pleasant conversation. So I learned early on how to navigate those conversations and I learned early on that there were ways of introducing a different mindset.” “I come at fashion with lightness of heart. I shot my last ad campaign in a landfill site for a reason, and to make a point, obviously. But the models looked happy, there was lightness, there was colour. My messaging is not the kind that is going to make you panic or feel rubbish about yourself or not sleep at night, because I don’t think that achieves much.” McCartney and her family – husband Alasdhair Willis and four children Miller, 13, Beckett, 11, Bailey, 10 and Reiley, 7 – live in London but spend weekends in the Worcestershire countryside, where she rides her horses and tends her garden. “Everything comes from nature. I mean, where does colour come from, if not from nature, from the changing of the seasons? Every fabric we use is emulating something from nature. Nature is … oh man, it’s magnificent, isn’t it?”Many of fashion’s great artists have been obsessed with nature. Christian Dior was a knowledgable gardener who channelled his passion into pieces such as his 1952 Vilmorin dress, hand-embroidered by the house of Rebe with thousands of tiny daisies. Alexander McQueen dressed women in dresses of razor clam shells, headdresses of antlers and shoes modelled on armadillo hooves. But the relationship has a dark side, from the fur trade to the monumental environmental impact of a global fashion industry that expends the Earth’s resources on clothes that are surplus to requirements. A survey of 2,000 British women by Barnardo’s last year found that the average piece of clothing was worn just seven times before being thrown away.The Stella McCartney pieces chosen for the exhibition reflect the contrasting emotions swirling around clothes and natural beauty. A catwalk outfit from last year features a horse print from the Stubbs painting Horse Frightened by a Lion, referencing the love of the countryside, of animals, and of horses in particular that McCartney inherited from her mother, Linda McCartney, still a constant presence in Stella’s world 20 years after she died. In another display case, the Mylo Falabella Prototype 1 is a handbag created in collaboration with the biotechnology company Bolt Threads, using a groundbreaking alternative to leather made from mycelium, which is the root structure of a mushroom. (“Please don’t call it mushroom leather, will you,” pleads a V\u0026ampA spokesperson wearily. “Mycelium is completely different from mushroom leather.”)From what feminism looks like on the red carpet to how to dress ethically, fashion finds itself in the eye of the moral storm. The primacy of inidual choice is the ideology of our age, and what we wear is the most public manifestation of that. It has become fashionable among prominent designers to make a moral stand and renounce fur: Donatella Versace last month joined Gucci and Michael Kors in proclaiming her brand fur-free. McCartney is happy to see this shift, although, from where she stands, it has taken too long. “Fur … it’s so medieval,” she sniffs. A personal ideology that was rooted in animal rights grew into “being mindful of the impact that fashion has on the environment, and became a conversation about this industry being the second most destructive industry that there is. And once you are aware of that, as a lover of nature and of life, you can’t ignore that.”Fashioned from Nature is the latest in a procession of fashion-related museum shows, with an Azzedine Alaïa retrospective at the Design Museum and the V\u0026ampA’s take on Frida Kahlo’s wardrobe and image hot on its heels. Central to it, says the curator, Edwina Ehrman, is the need “to get away from the idea that sustainable fashion should look quirky. We need leaders like Stella McCartney, who can tell scientists what the future needs to look like.”An exhibition is always telling a story about the era it is staged in, as much as about the past. Fashioned from Nature s a time period from 1600 to the present day, but it is a very different show than it would have been even a decade ago. Awareness has grown exponentially around the environmental impact of the fashion industry, which produces greenhouse gas emissions of 1.2bn tonnes a year, larger than that of international flights and shipping combined. To tackle this, “we need to completely rewire the hierarchies of fashion”, says Ehrman. The mindset by which a dress made up of rare materials imported from far-flung corners of the globe is the first to be put in a museum is finally being challenged.Those who scoff at the notion that the modern consumer might be made to read a shirt label and be impressed by, say, flax – a sustainable fibre because, when grown in the right climate, it needs no irrigation – should be encouraged by the clean eating movement, argues Ehrman. “The way the modern consumer behaves around food – reading the label, taking pride in knowing about ingredients, wanting to identify as the type of person who is knowledgable and makes informed choices – shows what is possible.” But for this to happen requires us “to reconnect with fabric, and fabric has been forgotten in modern fashion, which is all about surface and decoration. If we feel fabrics again, engage with our clothes on a tactile, sensual level, we might start valuing them sufficiently to be motivated to sew buttons back on, or hems back up.”The emotional trigger of ethical fashion has long belonged to animal rights. McCartney’s refusal to use leather and fur is the one fact everyone knows about her. Many of the most startling exhibits in Fashioned from Nature are those for which animals have grotesquely suffered: a pair of Brazilian red-legged honeycreeper birds made into earrings, their tiny bodies dangling like pompoms, would have been a prized accessory for a fashionable woman of the late 19th century. A dress made in the 1860s features embroidered “flowers” with the petals made up of about 5,000 iridescent green beetle wings, most of which would have been harvested from live beetles.But as awareness of animal rights pushes fur towards being a footnote in fashion history, fast fashion has become the focus. The poor record of workers’ rights in the production of fast fashion, its convoluted supply chains, environmentally reckless dye processes and short wardrobe life make cheaply produced garments the villain of the modern fashion piece. The circular economy is the buzz phrase in the industry – McCartney recently partnered with the RealReal, a resale company, to encourage shoppers to keep clothes in circulation by selling them on. But the issue cannot be tackled on a meaningful scale until it engages with the consumer who has neither the budget for designer fashion nor relatives dropping off piles of hand-me-down cashmere.There is just one high-street garment in Fashioned from Nature, a dress made from recycled ocean plastic from H\u0026ampM’s Conscious range. McCartney’s elegant ethics are beyond the budget of most people. She says she wishes more people “would save up and buy one thing at Stella McCartney instead of the 20 things they buy from a fast-fashion label”, but I am not convinced that most family budgets work like this. McCartney’s label takes another step upmarket this year with the opening of a new London flagship, on which she has been working “like a bat out of hell”, situated, symbolically, on Bond Street. (Her previous store was just off London’s main luxury drag.) What’s more, her name has been mentioned as a possible wedding dress designer for Meghan Markle. “I read this morning that you are designing the royal wedding dress,” I say to McCartney as she is preparing to leave. She laughs and raises a sceptical eyebrow. “Oh, you did, did you? You’re hilarious. How many designers have you said that to today?” That’s not a denial then, I point out. “Well, you didn’t actually ask a question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6199c2342bf2024a7310dc1b94705df9fac0e99/0_190_3120_1871/master/3120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bfcb2e6fc7a0e12d3926507e20cd7e3 1240w","title":"grease review john travolta olivia newton john","story":"Rereleased on its 40th anniversary, the nostalgic rock’n’roll high school musical remains a sugar-rush of a film‘What happened to the Danny Zuko I knew at the beach?” With this stunned and plaintive cry, Olivia Newton-John introduces the main theme and narrative dynamic of this still very enjoyable 1978 movie based on the original stage musical, which is now on rerelease.Newton John plays Sandy, and she’d met such a sweet boy over the summer, enjoying a more-or-less platonic beachside romance and imagining she would never see him again once she went back to Australia. But her family’s plans changed and, with the new term, Sandy shows up at the local high school and is astonished to see Danny, played by John Travolta. Compelled to be super-cool in front of his gang buddies, he is crudely dismissive of Sandy, but secretly still in love with her.We hear the classic split-point-of-view song Summer Nights, in which Sandy regales her saucer-eyed friends with Danny’s gallantry and Danny jeeringly implies he’d had his way with her on the sand. The movie is all about male identity, peer pressure, sex in that pre-pill era and innocently imagined rock’n’roll. Grease was also about race: the title had overtones of “greaseball”. Blond Sandy is as Waspy as they come Danny and some of his gang are regarded as outsiders partly because of their Italian American ethnicity – and the same goes for Rizzo, as tough as any boy, played by Stockard Channing.Grease broke John Travolta through to family audiences who might have been chary about his more adult movie sensation, Saturday Night Fever, the year before. It was part of the 70s fashion for 50s nostalgia that also had its expression in George Lucas’s American Graffiti and Garry Marshall’s longrunning TV show Happy Days, and survived in the form of Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future in 1985. Travolta’s effortless dancing here is different from his lithe and narcotically sexy disco performances in Saturday Night Fever. In Grease it is more family-friendly. Still superb, less about pelvic grinding than about the quiff, elbows and the knees rotating in 45-degree shunts, as if he were appearing in an Egyptian frieze. It’s still a sugar-rush of a film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893007c8bb46b312892379b7b423a8052de7f3ce/0_617_5669_3400/master/5669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e500e47dd3b549b867f70fe1e845546b 1240w","title":"mercury 13 space women nasa 1960s","story":"In a new Netflix documentary, the tales of 13 female pilots who dreamed of becoming astronauts yet were denied the opportunity by Nasa are finally brought to lightBut what if that one small step had been taken by a woman? What kind of leap would that have represented, at a time when the American public was waking up to women’s rights?That’s the focus of Mercury 13, a Netflix documentary that explores the fates of 13 female pilots who were prevented from entering Nasa’s space training program.The women featured in the film passed through some of the same physiological and psychological testing procedures as Nasa’s first male astronauts, as the space race with Russia ramped up in the early 1960s. In some cases, the women, each of them skilled flyers, fared better than their male counterparts, but their testing, which was designed to assess their suitability for space flight, was conducted with private funding without the approval of Nasa.As the women prepared to undergo further testing, which would have included flying jet planes, Nasa refused to extend the project. The women’s dreams were shattered, and it would be more than two decades before an American woman made it into space.After the release of Hidden Figures in 2016, which told the story of three black women who struggled for acceptance at Nasa during the space race, Mercury 13 offers a further glimpse into the difficulty women faced in breaking into the field.“I think it’s important to tell people that women were involved in the space program. There’s lots of films about the space program and lots of stories about the space program but they generally focus on men,” said Heather Walsh, who co-directed Mercury 13 with David Sington.“So I think it’s good to draw out these stories and show that women might not have been talked about but they were there, and they did help, and they did do their bit.”The film follows the story of the 13 women and their legal battle before Congress in 1962, arguing that they were prevented from further space testing and training on sexual discrimination grounds.Their case captured the imagination of the American public, but was rejected by President Johnson. It was a missed opportunity. Russia sent the first woman – Valentina Tereshkova – into space in 1963, winning a propaganda battle that the US could have otherwise claimed.Walsh believes there would have been greater implications than just a propaganda victory, had the US backed the Mercury 13 women.“I think everything would have changed. I think there would have been a female president by now,” she said. “Being an astronaut at that time was the pinnacle of what you could do. You know, the whole world was watching. And when you step out on to the moon there wasn’t a person on the planet that didn’t want to see you and didn’t know who you were.“And I think if that person was a woman it would have would have changed things. It would have seemed normal for women to do anything.”Mercury 13 interviews Wally Funk, Rhea Woltman, Sarah Ratley and Gene Nora Jessen, each of the women participated in space-readiness testing conducted by Dr William Randy Lovelace, who had helped develop the physical and psychological examinations used to select the first team of astronauts for the Nasa training program. Named Project Mercury, it was America’s first human spaceflight program, and would see Alan Shepard become the first American in space in 1962.Lovelace was close friends with Jacqueline Cochran, whose pilot skills had propelled her to fame in the 1930s. Cochran had set women’s national speed records and was involved in setting up establishing Women Airforce Service Pilots, who performed non-combat flying missions during the second world war.Cochran and Lovelace felt women had a role to play in space. Outside his contract with Nasa, Lovelace began a private screening program, conducting the same tests he had devised for men on female pilots.Jerrie Cobb, who later became a staunch advocate for female flyers, was the first to undergo space testing, but faced resistance in the media. Mercury 13 shows one clip from a television interview in the early 1960s that particularly illustrates the opposition the women faced. In the interview Cobb is quizzed as to why “there is a need” for women in space.She answered: “Well it’s the same thing as is there a need for men in space. I mean, if we’re going to send a human being into space we should send the one most qualified. And in certain areas women have to offer, in other areas men do. I think we ought to use both.”Sington, who previously directed In the Shadow of the Moon, a documentary about manned US missions to the moon, said he and Walsh had originally hoped to bring Hillary Clinton’s success in the 2016 election into the film.Clinton has often told a story about writing to Nasa as a teenager, asking how she could become an astronaut. She said she received a letter back “saying they weren’t accepting women”, and Sington said contrasting that experience with her subsequent presidency would have provided an uplifting ending.Clearly, that didn’t happen.We’ll never know if Walsh is correct – and if we would have had a female president by now had a woman been the first to walk on the moon. Even if the Mercury 13 had passed the aptitude tests, they might still have been rejected – perhaps Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would still have proved more able, and the first person on the moon would still have been a man.But as Cobb told her skeptical interviewer in the 1960s: women should have been given the opportunity to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e6a80eed58b1c5b845f1f1643f9d51b925efe9/0_281_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f9ec498d1cd6a958dd344e2bd1eef0f4 1240w","title":"joey barton fleetwood head coach betting ban","story":"Joey Barton will begin his managerial career at League One’s Fleetwood Town on 2 June when a suspension for breaking Football Association betting regulations ends.Barton was at Burnley when he received the 18-month ban, later reduced to 13, for gambling on 1,260 football matches or competitions from 2006 to 2016.“My first job in management was always going to be a big decision for me and I’m delighted with the opportunity ahead, I’m joining a club with big ambitions.

While he was fined six weeks’ wages – two of which were suspended for a week - Tandy later sued Barton, winning £65,000 in damages.After an altercation with a 15-year-old Everton fan at City’s team hotel in Bangkok the following July, Barton was found guilty of gross misconduct and fined eight weeks. Two years later Barton left team-mate Ousmane Dabo requiring team-mate hospital treatment for which he received a four-month suspended jail sentence for assault, plus a 12-match ban - six matches suspended - £25,000 fine.Barton’s nadir came in May 2008 when he got a six month sentence for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool city centre the previous December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eae78171d03d7ce13200a6f8c99138603119dbb/144_87_1915_1149/master/1915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e18e7cc3fc9dd0036e94c1b12b51437 1240w","title":"manchester city dominate pfa premier league team of the year","story":"Five Manchester City players have been named in the Professional Footballers’ Association Premier League Team of the Year.Having been confirmed as champions on Sunday after second-placed Manchester United lost 1-0 to West Bromwich Albion, the Etihad celebrations continue with the choice, by their fellow professionals, of defenders Nicolás Otamendi and Kyle Walker, midfielders Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva and forward Sergio Agüero as part of a three-man attack.

I am strongly attracted to a friend with whom I work. We meet up once a year and work together for several weeks across the summer. The rest of the year, I’m in another country.Last summer I told him I was attracted to him, and his reaction was initially one of joy and surprise. Moments later his attitude changed and he started to talk about his “issues”. Over the next few weeks, he distanced himself from me. We did have one good talk, during which he said he was worried about detrimental effects on his mental health if things didn’t work out. I get strong signals that he would be very interested, except for this fear holding him back.Since separating our work has required us to remain in email contact. Besides work emails, I have sent several personal emails in which I have told him in detail about how I feel about him and how much I value and admire him, in the hope that it will give him some reassurance. I’ve not had much response, other than a brief thank you in acknowledgement, to these.I am in a quandary about what to do when we meet up again this summer. I flip between thinking I will keep my distance and let it go, and thinking I will push things a little further. But I am very worried that pushing things further may constitute harassment.You say you get “strong signals that he would be very interested except for this fear holding him back”, but the signals that you’ve described here are, alas, not that. You told your friend that you were attracted to him in person and he told you that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with you. You told him again, over email, how you felt about him, and you’ve “not had much response”.I’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your friend wants to date you. Who knows why not? It may be the “issues” he professes. It may be something else altogether, but the bottom line is that it’s not your job to persuade him otherwise.That’s not to say I don’t understand your desire to encourage him to feel otherwise! You mentioned that his initial reaction to you confessing your feelings was joyful, and it’s natural to wish that you could help him get back to that feeling. But what I learned from my own experience with ambivalent men (and oh my, I have known quite a few ambivalent men) is that the key to a successful relationship is two people wanting to be in a relationship. You can be kind and you can be encouraging, but you can’t make someone want to be with you by persistence and force of will.Will trying again to persuade your friend constitute harassment? I think it could be viewed as unwanted behaviour. Imagine if the gender roles were reversed: in this post-#MeToo world, a man who asks a female colleague out repeatedly after she says no would be seen as a creep. Even if he did not make a formal complaint if you “push things a little further”, your continued pursuit after your friend gave you a pretty clear no may make him uncomfortable, and have a negative effect on your experience working together. That would be a shame, since you clearly care about your friend and your work.Please don’t lose heart, or at least not too much. That you’ve written to ask me this question and that you don’t want to step over the line shows that you are a thoughtful and caring person. I’m certain that you will meet someone who you adore who will adore you back without caveat or condition or hesitation: someone who, like you, is ready, not afraid. I teach English as a foreign language and I’ve always been a bit wary about relationships related to work – both with colleagues and students (adult students, obviously). Although I’m relaxed about being friends with adult students outside of the classroom, I’ve always personally carried the idea that dating students is something that shouldn’t happen.However, I’ve met other teachers who’ve ended up in great romantic relationships with students (often after they’ve stopped being their teacher) and who now have happy marriages. I’m curious to know what you and others think, especially as it could potentially be an issue for me in the future.You gut feeling is correct: you should not date your students, even if they are adult students. The student-teacher relationship is inherently imbalanced in favour of the teacher’s authority, even if the student pursues the teacher, rather than vice versa. (Jo Livingstone wrote very well about this in the New Republic.) Your no dating students rule is right because it respects the reason that your students are spending time with you: to learn. A classroom is not a singles bar. I would also say that if a teacher is standing in front of a classroom of adult ESL students and thinking about which one of them is most attractive, rather than how to help them learn English, the teacher is … not really doing their job?Drawing the line at dating students also eliminates risks: that your relationship with one student might have a negative impact on your other students, your ability to do your job or your employer’s perception of your motivation and performance. These are all things that you’ll put on the line if you date a student, even if the relationship itself is True Love.Once someone is no longer studying under you, I think you can feel free to ask them out – when they’re not your student, but your peer.

A spokesperson for Roach said that all sales at Alexandra Wharf were at “open market value”, adding that the businessman’s political donations had been properly declared on the Electoral Commission website.They added that the pair had known each other for “several years” but had no business relationship beyond the purchase of the flats.A spokesperson for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. “Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase. “As Jeremy has been clear from the outset, the rental income from these properties will be donated to charity.”Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of complimentary venue hire. The pair were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel in Guildford, Surrey, that was developed by Nicolas James Group. Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman for the committee on standards in public life said: “In terms of public perception of ministerial priorities, Hunt seems more concerned with maximising his personal interests rather than ensuring that there are good public services.“On a local level, there does seem to be an incestuous relationship between a local donor and a local politician in a way which will make the public uneasy.”According to the MPs’ code of conduct, “members shall fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the House in respect of the registration of interests in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests”.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only Hunt’s wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m.The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2019fced7d93af14d85ce6216f74d9ada8979306/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53318337177f31f19695436b134fdcf6 1240w","title":"ministers to announce brexit climbdown as they face lords defeat","story":"Amendment calling for UK to continue in customs union with EU passed by majority of 123Theresa May has suffered an embarrassing defeat in the House of Lords over the issue of Britain’s membership of the customs union, increasing pressure on the government to reopen the issue.An amendment to the EU withdrawal bill tabled by crossbencher Lord Kerr, and backed by several senior Conservatives, as well as Labour and the Lib Dems, was passed by a 348 votes to 225 – a majority of 123.The government suffered a significant rebellion, with 24 Conservatives, including former ministers Lord Patten, Lord Heseltine and Lord Willetts, backing the amendment.The debate on the government’s key piece of Brexit legislation, in a packed chamber, was watched by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. Afterwards, he said: “The passing of this cross-party amendment is an important step forward. Theresa May must now listen to the growing chorus of voices who are urging her to drop her red line on a customs union and rethink her approach.”Explaining why he believed a customs union was so important, Kerr underlined the difficulty of replacing the UK’s trade with the EU with new deals with other countries. “Looking further afield is well worth doing, but it will be very hard not to see a fall in overall exports if our trade with the EU is made more complicated, and it will be much more complicated if we leave the customs union. We must try to limit the damage of our nearest, because closest, market,” he said.The amendment would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken, to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”.A source from the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) had earlier stressed that the government would not keep the UK in a customs union.But opposition peers hoped that a hefty defeat could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons.Once the Lords has amended the bill, it will be returned to the House of Commons, which will decide whether to accept the changes, or refer them back to peers, in a process known as “ping pong”.Separately, Labour peers were expecting the government to signal a climbdown over the separate issue of the UK adopting EU rules on clinical trials.Ministers were expected to accept the substance of an amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Patel, which would ensure EU clinical trial regulations – which have not yet come into force – were enacted in UK law.The rules are aimed at streamlining clinical trials across the EU, allowing drugs firms to submit a single cross-EU application – and making it easier for pharmaceutical companies to conduct cross-border trials.The EU withdrawal bill transfers EU law on to the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit – and grants the government sweeping powers to tweak it in the process.The government was also expecting to lose a later vote, limiting ministers’ powers to downgrade protections in key areas including the labour market and the environment without consulting parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c34991e4cd9f4f17332ff36d37fc9164eb43d2/0_120_3481_2089/master/3481.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a4cdbfd8a0f39fc706af47e4a8d93609 1720w","title":"peter sagan pope cyclist cycling paris roubaix interview","story":"Sagan is the most popular rider in cycling today and, with the murky uncertainty surrounding Chris Froome and Team Sky, his victory felt like a shaft of light which revealed panache and grit. They call Paris-Roubaix the ‘Hell of the North’, because its 29 cobbled sections have a bone-juddering impact on even the toughest and most brilliant riders. It is also the glittering peak among the five monuments which are cycling’s oldest and most prestigious one-day races.This year the severity of the challenge was underlined by the death of the young Belgian cyclist Michael Goolaerts, who suffered a cardiac arrest. For just under six hours Sagan was in a battle and his feat was accentuated by the fact he broke for glory a startling 53km from the finish. The Swiss cyclist Silvan Dillier clung to a narrow lead as they entered the velodrome, but Sagan was imperious in the final 100m.“Twice I didn’t finish Roubaix,” Sagan says, “and in those races I did finish I was in much worse condition than this year. If you’re fighting for first position your emotions are very different. I was not thinking: ‘This is the hell of the north.’ But you realise one, two, three days later how tired you are. Especially the first morning, I was so tired when I woke up from shaking on the cobblestones.”Sagan sinks into the couch in a Maastricht hotel. We’re a week past Paris-Roubaix and it’s the day before he finishes fourth in the Amstel Gold Race – a 261km ride featuring 35 serious climbs – and the toll is obvious. Yet he is much more involved than he had been in a stilted press conference preceding our interview. As the routine questions from the Dutch press corps arrived slowly, Sagan quipped: “Is this a funeral?”Here, in a more relaxed setting, it seems appropriate to consider Sagan’s remarkable rise from obscurity in Slovakia to becoming the world’s premier sprint cyclist and star of the peloton. The 28-year-old, who rides for the German team Bora-Hansgrohe, became the first reigning world champion to win Paris-Roubaix since Bernard Hinault in 1981. This second classic, after Sagan won Flanders in 2016, sits alongside other milestones. Last year only a controversial disqualification, after Mark Cavendish fell heavily in a bunch sprint, ended Sagan’s run of five successive Tour de France points victories in the green jersey. He then won a third consecutive world championship in Norway.After that victory Bradley Wiggins tweeted, of Sagan: “Cycling’s saviour! This man is currently bigger than the sport, look after him. Congrats Peter, a true legend and one of the all-time greats!” This\u0026nbspgushing reaction mirrors the online response whenever Sagan pulls a giddy stunt – as in 2015 when he was John Travolta to his wife Katarina’s Olivia Newton-John and they acted out the fairground scene from Grease.Sagan reaches an audience which might not know the difference between the cobbled hell of Paris‑Roubaix and the hilly agony of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Yet Sagan can also be crass and, after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, he pinched the behind of a podium girl.It feels apt to linger over Roubaix. Sagan’s instinctive daring meant he accelerated away early from his main rivals and hunted down the breakaway riders. “It wasn’t planned. It just happened. I started to believe this year could be the year so I told Silvan Dillier: ‘We must work together because behind us are strong guys. If you stick with me there’s a chance for you.’”Afterwards, Dillier said evocatively: “Sagan is an angel and a devil in the same person – an angel because he took me with him and a devil because I had to go man‑to‑man with him.”Sagan nods. “A race is a race and at the end you take it.”He pauses when reminded of Goolaerts’ fate. “I didn’t know him personally. But it’s a shame and I’m very sorry. I don’t know exactly what happened but I don’t think we can blame the sport.”His victory was watched by his father and the emotion they shared sparked memories of their humble Slovakian past, in the town of Zilina, a world away from cycling’s heartlands. “My parents met at a restaurant where they worked as waiters,” Sagan explains. “After some time my father opened a small supermarket. It was still one of the bigger ones in our city. Lots of people came to us and we were also selling beer in tanks. But after they opened big supermarkets in Zilina – like Tesco and Carrefour – in two years my parents’ business was gone completely. My father opened a pizzeria next but they had to work very hard.”When I mention seeing people chortling at his internet escapades he smiles. “Oh yeah? That’s a pleasure for me. I’m happy.”There are moments when Sagan reminds me of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He is capable of outrageous brilliance, amusing arrogance and sly wit – even if Sagan is a much more measured talker. He still once described himself as an artist. Sagan\u0026nbspnods and points to a bland painting behind us.“For me art is not just a picture like this. Art can take many forms – even in sport. Look at motocross where they do triple back-flips in the mud and land without any issues. That’s art because the rider is doing something impossible for other\u0026nbsppeople.”Sagan might be an artist on his bike but does he feel a responsibility to improve cycling’s battered image? “If you ask me how could I help cycling I would say by being myself. I want to make people enjoy life – because so many people have a hard time. Maybe some of the videos are a little ridiculous, like I’m a clown, but it’s fun. The Grease thing with my wife was my idea. I tried to be good.”I am curious to know what Sagan thinks of Froome. Should the four‑times Tour de France winner be\u0026nbspallowed to race while his lawyers try to clear his name after he was found to have twice the permitted amount of Salbutamol at the Vuelta\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspEspaña last year?Sagan starts to answer but his team’s media officer, an otherwise genial man who accompanies him, interrupts. It is team policy not to comment on the affairs of other riders. I try again and ask Sagan directly. “It’s not my responsibility to discuss this,” he replies.What about the grey area of TUEs – therapeutic use exemptions – as Froome insists his doctor advised him to use his inhaler more when his asthma deteriorated? Sagan shrugs. “If somebody’s sick then\u0026nbsp…”It is, however, an important area as Team Sky have been castigated in a parliamentary hearing for their use of TUEs and Wiggins, another British winner of the Tour de France, has been implicated. “I don’t worry about this,” Sagan stonewalls.Some cycling fans are worried about motors being hidden on bikes but, for Sagan: “If somebody has not been proved guilty then what do you\u0026nbspsay?”Sagan is amused when I ask about his infamous bum-pinching moment on the Flanders podium five years ago. “That was young Peter,” he laughs, raising his hands in guilt. “But she reacted really well and thanks to her for understanding. She did not turn it into a serious problem. But it was a difficult time. I thought: ‘What’s going to happen?”Why did he do it? “Maybe it’s my personality. I don’t know. I was happy I came second and I had my friends around the podium. One of them said, spontaneously, ‘Just touch her thigh or ass’, and I said: ‘Yeah!’ I didn’t think about the consequences. But you have to respect people – otherwise it’s anarchy.”Six months ago Sagan became a father. “Marlon is healthy. He’s laughing, he’s a good boy,” he says of his son. “It’s too early to speak about whether there’s been any change in my perspective because he’s still very small.”As his fame grows so Sagan’s world expands and in January he met the pope. “I was very happy to bring my mother to see the pope. It was her present. I also gave the pope his personal bicycle which was specially made for him. It’s not every day you shake hands with the pope.”Sagan is not the saviour of cycling. He is just an ordinary man, with an extraordinary talent, and so he smiles. “I think being the pope is much harder than being a cyclist,” he says. “I’m not the superhero. I’m not saving people’s lives. I’m just a sportsman. It’s something I’m doing for myself and if people enjoy it then I’m happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24968a80aa7afa710b6bd95110517c76e1f70a5/0_55_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=21ea18d8b3cb34066beaec40e476b5fd 1240w","title":"tms talksport radio change cricket england","story":"Stop all the clocks. Stamp a single steel-toed work boot through Mrs Blenkinsop’s sensational triple-tiered Victoria sponge. Prevent the dog from barking with a bag of gravel. For BBC Test Match Special is dead. Or at least, suspended for a bit over the autumn and winter.Instead commercial radio is back in the shape of TalkSport, which has outbid the BBC for rights to England’s autumn and winter Test tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies. And nothing now can ever come to any good. Except, of course for the fact it may actually be all right.A quick census of the loudest online voices suggests the general response to this news has been somewhere on the spectrum between regret, dismay and a great swirling fudge of mawkish, cake-fondling, doily-clutching Middle England horror.Understandably so, too. It is a mark of the way Test cricket is cherished in England that the idea of different voices bringing it into your kitchen or down through the headphones in the insomniac hours is like a familial loss. Test Match Special is much-loved. For many people its enforced break during the winter will be an absence that goes beyond sport, a missing beat in the rhythms of the day.And yet there are limits to this. The sense of mild hysteria, the social media suggestion that losing TMS for a few months is “worse than Brexit” seems a little overdone. For a start someone should probably check on Jonathan Agnew, who seems to think his employer being outbid for some broadcast rights is a national disaster on the scale of the death of Princess Diana and that ice skating woman falling over all rolled into one. Imagine Princess Diana falling over in an ice skating race, thereby accidentally derailing Charlotte Dujardin’s quest for dressage gold, while simultaneously being denied the right to broadcast cricket on the BBC. That’s how bad we’re talking.Or at least this appears to be the case judging by Agnew’s funereal tweets on the subject. Not only is the self-righteous tone a provocation to every other working broadcaster involved in covering the sport, it also does a disservice to the genuine depth of feeling around this.There are good reasons why cricket on the BBC is an emotive issue. The corporation played a hand in keeping the sport going when it might have died after the second world war, re-spinning its mass popularity into the fabric of the summer. Plenty of us wouldn’t have known cricket existed but for the BBC – Peter West, Tony Lewis and all that, smiling avuncular men in blazers staring right into the camera on a grey Tuesday morning in the dog days of the summer.Plus on a more basic level Test Match Special does a fine job, credit to some brilliant journalists and producers. Simon Mann, Charles Dagnall, Isa Guha, Daniel Norcross and the rest are all excellent. Vic Marks, also of these pages, offers the kind of voice you do not often hear on any media, determinedly anti-sensational voice, wryly humorous in hectoring times. TalkSport will have a huge job on its hands just trying to meet the same standards of analysis and reporting.It should be said Agnew is also a brilliant broadcaster, and hugely popular too, the best out there at simply pointing himself at his sport and talking, with a wonderfully easy style. But he is also a part of why some may welcome a bit of variation, those moments where the sense of vital work being done, of weepy self-importance slips into something else. Imagine the phrase “Bumptious BBC self-regard” baked in a nuclear reactor until it finally grows arms and legs, escapes, kits itself out in chinos and begins talking in a cosy, righteous tone about delivering a vital national service.There is nothing in the rules that says this is the way cricket must be presented, or that everyone will like it. The endless goodbye to Henry Blofeld, for example, was fair enough but I’ve also heard cricket-loving kids say the Blofeld tone is why lots of other kids their age think cricket is just for posh, entitled people. They cringe at the idea of introducing their football-loving schoolmates to the great summer sport only to find Blofeld on, flapping about cakes and pigeons and dear old things. You what, mate?On the other hand new things can be good. Competition can be good. Giving someone else a go can give everyone a lift. At which point enter, to the sound of Darth Vader’s march, the dreaded TalkSport. The new kid will not be to everyone’s taste at first. It can be blokey and relentless, far more tabloid in style and tone. Not to mention overly obsessed with wood stain and van hire, adverts that will jar with the rhythms at first, although past broadcasts suggests this quickly fades.There are deeper currents too. TalkSport is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, which bought the Wireless Group two years ago. Plenty will object to the most ruthless and iconoclastic of media families taking over the presentation of their beloved five-day game. On the other hand the cricket boards of Sri Lanka and West Indies will be grateful for extra funds the BBC would not stretch to.Plus there is plenty of evidence to suggest the product will be decent. Early rumours suggest the excellent Steve Harmison and – yes – even the great David Lloyd may be regulars. Change, different voices, a new audience: these are things cricket has needed for a while. So save the tear-soaked cake crumbs, the sense of bumptious entitlement. You never know, the new world may not be so terrible after all."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Her single-minded determination is a subject that comes up again and again when talking to her close – and very passionate – family and friends about her rollercoaster career.After an injury five years ago, Perri had to learn to walk again and switch disciplines from hurdles to sprinting. And this month, despite doctors and physiotherapists setting her chances of a full recovery at around zero, she’s competing as a member of Team England in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.“She wasn’t so focused at first,” says Chris Zah, her trainer for the past 18 years. “When we started working together, I made her do everything from 60m sprinting to cross-county. She hated it, and didn’t see the point. As a kid from east London, she really wasn’t keen on mud.”Perri’s outlook changed in 2007, after coming second in the 400m hurdles at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships.“She grabbed me and said: ‘What are we going to do about this then?’” Chris says. “From then on, we agreed to think outside the box. I’d watch her competitors and say: ‘This girl gets to the first hurdle in 6.2 seconds, so you’ve got to get there in 6.1.’ She’d reply: ‘Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’”This attitude, along with her natural talent, pushed Perri to the world No 2 spot in women’s hurdles. But in 2013, she suffered a torn ligament and cartilage damage in her left knee at the finals of the World Championships in Moscow, leaving her unable to walk. “It’s when you’re at your fastest that your body is most likely to break down, and I’d just won two gold medals,” Perri says. “I tried to stay positive, but I went to some dark places.”Her family, along with Chris, rallied round to encourage Perri not to give up, even on her lowest days. “I used to be so frightened, I could only watch her run by peeping between my fingers,” says Perri’s mum, Norma. “I’d get so nervous – like it was me on that starting line. I’d tell her to run like she could see me at the finish line with my arms open. So when she got injured, it was a terrible time – I can’t put it into words. There were a lot of tears. It’s amazing to think how far she’s come since she was sitting on the sofa with her leg up, recovering.”Norma is speaking from LA, where she’s helping niece Jodie celebrate her 30th birthday. The pair’s enthusiasm for talking about Perri, who they call “the CEO of the family”, sees them scrambling to finish each other’s sentences.“We grew up together, so she’s more like my sister than a cousin,” Jodie says of Perri. “When she got injured I dragged her out to parties on her crutches. I told her it could be worse, that she’d bounce back. Now, she’s better and stronger than ever, and she amazes me every day.”Part of Perri’s fierce determination is a legacy from her father, Patrick, who for 14 years was one of boxer Lennox Lewis’s fitness trainers. “She’s passionate and competitive, and so am I,” Patrick says. “I’ve always been there in the background to guide her if she comes unstuck and asks her dad for help.“If she’s down, I’m a picker-upper, and I was there for her for physio and hospital appointments. It’s taken determination and grit to get past her injury, but having good people around you, that’s what gets you through.”In 2014, during her rehabilitation, Perri met her fiance, Mike Edwards, an entrepreneur and athlete. Welcomed by the family with open arms – “It’s like I’ve gained a brother and Norma has gained a son,” Jodie says – he helped Perri to connect with the world beyond sport during her recovery.“Perri had a strong desire to get back on top, but I wanted to offer her positive distractions and give her a bigger life beyond track and field,” Mike explains. “With my cigar business, I’d developed myself as a person and, in turn, Perri had achieved athletic goals I was trying to achieve myself. We really inspired each other.“After all she’s been through, she’s bulletproof. It’s great that we’ve been able to support each other.” Perri has come a long way – and as always, her family will be right behind her in Australia. “Everything she feels, we feel, so it’s like we’re all running that race with her,” Jodie says. “We lifted her back up as a family – and when she competes at the games, everyone will see what we see.”npower – proud sponsors of Team England and Jerusalem, their official anthem for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6077ffbd82ba44726ed6319c5fcdc0ebd884814/23_106_2438_1462/master/2438.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0735cc438f529dbf931613d619bf1956 1240w","title":"geese breeding dutch motorists netherlands","story":"Hundreds of geese spotted in grasslands around roads in east Netherlands, with some birds swooping into paths of vehiclesThe emergence of the Netherlands as the most popular place in Europe for geese has prompted an urgent call for Dutch drivers to watch out for hundreds of birds breeding on the grassy junctions and motorways verges.The Netherlands’ intensive farming and temperate climate make it the best country for geese in Europe, according to the Sovon Dutch centre for field ornithology, the organisation responsible for surveying bird populations.The population boom, however, is not without problems. Roadside grasslands are particularly attractive to breeding birds because of their the abundance of clover leaves and protection from predators.Hundreds of geese have been spotted off roads in Gelderland in the east of the country and elsewhere. Others have been swooping down into the paths of cars and lorries, presumably seeking to protect their offspring. A stretch of road in the town of Opheusden, in Gelderland, reported four collisions in a week.Albert de Jong from the Sovon centre called for drivers to be wary, but insisted that it was for the government now to take the risks seriously and build infrastructure to deter the birds from major roads.“We have during the summer more than 500,000 geese and we are a small country,” he said. “That’s because we are very suitable for them. The junctions on the motorways provide small pieces of nature. There is grass, access to water, and they are away from predatory risk as it is too dangerous for the foxes. Geese are very opportunistic.“It is a dangerous situation. I have seen some just flying in front of vehicles or walking on to the roads. They are defending their territory. First of all we need to discover the areas where they are breeding, where this is a problem. We know a lot of them but not all of them. We need to make it less attractive to the geese. Drivers aren’t going to drive more slowly for them.”The Dutch government had said in 2013 that it wanted to reduce the size of its goose population back to its 2005 levels which, experts say, would entail the slaughter of 500,000 birds. The state pays tens of millions of euros to farmers every year to compensate for damage to crops caused by greylag, barnacle and white-fronted geese.Schiphol and Noord-Holland have been in a long-running fight for approval to gas thousands of geese in the area around the airport, one of the biggest in Europe, despite a court ban.A spokesman for the Rijkswaterstaat, which is responsible for road safety, told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that it was constantly erecting fences to keep animals off the roads but that this was impossible for flying birds. “We cannot quite avoid that entirely,” the spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd673b1b51c09e2540fe115527a06191bd63bea3/0_27_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75fa8643351789ab5c1f2d04c5fb0ea2 1240w","title":"raul castro cuba step down leader miguel diaz canel","story":"Cubans view shift with indifference, not hope, as current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel is expected to replace Raúl CastroWhen Cuba’s president stands down this week, it will mark the first time in nearly six decades that the island will be led by somebody whose last name is not Castro.On Wednesday, the country’s national assembly selected the current vice-president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, as the sole candidate to replace Raúl Castro, in a nomination likely to be backed unanimously and officially announced on Thursday. The handover will mark the end of an era: Cuba without the Castros has been the holy grail for Florida-based Cuban exiles – and a policy vigorously pursued by a dozen successive US presidents. But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector, said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a new president were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although he has been in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised on an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c8c49603e451ff4549845248130136c03d3b8d/0_0_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce066730c9982b5fe57ca8a62c8d3221 1240w","title":"turkey to hold snap elections on 24 june says erdogan","story":"Turkish president says country urgently needs to make switch to an executive presidencyTurkey has brought forward elections that could pave the way for a single-party state with few checks on the power of the president to 24 June, a year and a half ahead of schedule.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, announced the new date after meeting Devlet Bahçeli, his ally and head of the nationalist bloc in parliament, who had called on Tuesday for early presidential and parliamentary elections.“We have decided that elections should be held on 24 June 2018,” Erdoğan said at the presidential palace. “Our preference has been to try to hold out till the date in November 2019. However, whether it be the cross-border operation in Syria, or the historic developments in Iraq and Syria have made it so that it is paramount for Turkey to overcome uncertainty.”The winner will assume the presidency of the Turkish republic with broad powers that were approved after a constitutional referendum last year. The elections are likely to take place under a state of emergency that has been in place since a coup attempt in July 2016.Before Wednesday Erdoğan had repeatedly pledged to hold the elections in 2019 as originally planned, but fears of an economic downturn had recently rekindled speculation that he might change his mind. Bahçeli’s proposal and its quick acceptance by the president was a stunning turnaround that will leave just two months before elections that will transform the political scene in Turkey, sealing its evolution from a parliamentary democracy into an executive presidency with sweeping powers.Turkey held a referendum on presidential powers in April last year. Narrowly approved by voters, the constitutional amendments abolished the office of prime minister and allowed the president to be a member of a political party, appoint unelected vice-presidents, and have a greater say in appointing judges to the highest judicial board in the country, as well as issuing decrees with the force of law.On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspThe government, led by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP), has launched a wide-ranging crackdown on dissidents in the aftermath of the coup, which is widely believed to have been carried out by followers of Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in Pennsylvania.The crackdown has gone beyond the Gülenists to encompass opposition MPs, academics and the media, with dissident journalists imprisoned or facing prosecution for allegedly abetting terrorist groups. Turkey this year was the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt. “I think 24 June is going to be a historic day in Turkey,” said Soner Çağaptay, director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute and author of a biography of Erdoğan. “It is when the office of prime minister will cease to exist, when the president will be able to rule by decree and the executive presidency will fully form. We will be switching from one Turkey to another, and it will be a dramatic day.” Bahçeli, whose Nationalist Movement party (MHP) entered into a formal electoral alliance with the AKP, had called on Tuesday for elections to be held in August.. Erdoğan said Turkey’s ongoing campaigns in Syria and Iraq, where it has intervened to fight Islamic State militants and Kurdish paramilitaries, as well as the need to more rapidly implement the new presidential system, made it necessary to hold early elections. Turkish-backed rebels in Syria recently achieved victory in a campaign to conquer the Kurdish enclave of Afrin near the border, a military operation that was widely popular in Turkey. But experts and observers say the early elections are meant to get ahead of the effects of economic troubles. An ongoing steep fall in the value of the Turkish lira, coupled with warnings of an overheating economy and a widening current account deficit, threaten the popularity of the AKP, which has often banked on a healthy and growing economy as a key element of its popular strength. The party is also likely to capitalise on nationalist sentiment, which is on the rise after the Afrin operation. Early elections may also leave Erdoğan with a limited field of competitors. The main secularist opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), has failed to win successive elections for 16 years and struggles to field credible presidential candidates. Selahattin Demirtaş, the charismatic leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) has been in prison for over a year and his party has been decimated by arrests of mayors, cadres and MPs, with lawsuits stripping the latter of their immunity. Meral Akşener, a popular nationalist leader who defected from Bahçeli’s party last year to set up her own, may face procedural hurdles for her party to run in the elections because of a rule that requires political parties to hold a general congress at least six months before the polls. She was billed as a credible opponent to Erdoğan due to her nationalist credentials and the fact that she is a practicing Muslim with secular views on government, and her ability to target both centrist voters and others from the president’s base.

But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465833.1524072760!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why the good weather this week is not a mini heatwave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoxer dogs Tyson and Lexie, from Ringsend, Dublin, enjoying the warmer weather in the sea at Sandymount. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw It may feel like it’s unseasonably warm in coming days, but that is more to do with a winter marked by low average temperatures since January, including two extended periods when large dumpings of snow fell on most of the country – and months marked by a notable absence of Sun.All of that means “nature is behind” its normal cycle, according to forecaster Harm Luijkx.This week will add up to “a short spell of decent weather, ending in the middle of the weekend”, he adds. And while it is a welcome change from a long Irish winter, which was also marked by above average rainfall in most areas, temperatures will struggle to reach 18 degrees.Eastern areas and the midlands will benefit most from the warmer conditions, in contrast to the west of Ireland.By Saturday, the best that can be hoped for is 16 degrees, though it will feel humid– average temperatures for this time of year are 12 to 13 degrees.By Sunday, it will back to cooler temperatures, but normal for this time of year, and with broken weather due to Atlantic weather fronts replacing the effects of a high over mainland Europe.London and southeast England are predicted to reach temperatures of 25 to 26 degrees in coming days due to that high pressure over the Continent, he says, but even that would not be classified as a mini-heatwave – such temperatures are normal for that region, he says.The rise in Irish temperatures will nonetheless improve soil temperatures, Luijkx predicts, and improve growing conditions for farmers, who have had to struggle with waterlogged fields and a dearth of fodder due to a lack of grass – heralding a very late but welcome spring.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?The Crossword Club provides access to an archive of more than 6,000 interactive crosswords from The Irish Times.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireIn the village of Oram, five kilometres north of Castleblayney, his people encircle him to say farewell to a king. They welcome all comers, thousands of them, from far and wide. All day they arrive, and into the evening. Music leaks from car radios, and at one stage the strain of a few people singing Gentle Mother wafts through the carpark.From Castleblayney, a series of discreet signs brings a stream of cars to Oram Gaelic Football Club. Big Tom McBride gave the land for the clubhouse and pitch to his beloved club 25 years ago, and it was a fitting place to publicly wake him the family home nearby is private on Thursday before Friday’s funeral in the local church. The hall is dominated by an enormous painting of Big Tom playing the guitar. Below it the coffin is cordoned off (no touching, no pictures). He looks at peace, with a guitar at the foot of the coffin, a drape with his image laid over him, and a single white rose. His tie has musical notes on it, and the pins on his lapel include a couple of guitars. They line up through the length of the hall and outside to pay their respects to his family, and see Big Tom for the last time. Then upstairs for tea and biscuits. Faintly in the background, under the hum of the crowd, Big Tom’s hits are playing. It is all done with dignity, efficiency and courtesy.Tom’s brother-in-law Paddy King says there was “no big-headedness about him”. He played bass guitar with Tom, and “sang the pop stuff”. Margo comes over and they talk about Tom and Rose. “They were unreal” says Margo. “Inseparable,” agrees Paddy. She says Rose’s priority before she died in January was for Tom to “get the CD done”. The Pleasure has Been Mine will be released with a duet with Margo of A Love That’s Lasted Through the Years. “Look after that man of mine,” she told Margo. Margo recalls visiting him at home after her death he was in bed, and she noticed his pillow was wet with tears. “The boss is gone,” he said.When Margo and Daniel O’Donnell’s mother visited Margo in Castleblayney, she always wanted visited Tom and Rose.Another neighbour Kevin McCooey played relief (support), then later sax with Tom’s band. “He was like Cliff Richard, he had a hit record every decade”. He was Tom’s manager: “He gave me a job in 1975. I’m unemployed from Friday.” McCooey’s recalls in his twenties, playing with Tom and the Travellers in the Galtymore dancehall in Cricklewood , and people crying at the front when Tom sang Gentle Mother. “They were young emigrants. I wondered, had they lost their mother, or maybe missing her.” The Galtymore closing was “the lonesomest night of Tom’s life” he said. Margo introduces Derek Ryan, “the new superstar”. His father was a Big Tom fan and Ryan grew up with Tom and Margo, he says. When he was 12 he played drums in a band supporting Big Tom - “I used to say: I played Big Tom’s Drums”.Country star TR Dallas says Tom “took a song, and regardless of whoever wrote it or had it, in his good Monaghan accent, it would become a Tom Song. He was a great singer.”Marty Mone, another young Monaghan star, recalls as a seven year old seeing a tape of Big Tom singing in a packed dancehall, with a rose stuck in his guitar, and he knew “I’m going to be a singer”. This is “Big Tom’s country. You realise that’s why people know Castleblayney.”Neighbour Sheila Comiskey says “he never said no to anyone”, and recalls him inviting a friend’s dying aunt to his home. Fan Anna Gallagher travelled on the 9am ferry from Arranmore then drove for three hours to pay her respects. She comes to the Oram’s Patrick’s Day parade, led by Big Tom, and spent her 60th birthday at his house: “It was the last word.”Neighbour Mickey Quinn is wearing a high-vis jacket. His first memory of Tom is playing football - “he was finishing when I was starting, and he looked after young fellas like me. He was a gentle giant on and off the field, but if some fella wanted to play it the other way he facilitated him. He could look after himself.”Mary Murray is a neighbour but regularly travels far on “women’s weekends away” to see Big Tom. In Mayo “they adored him, it was lovely to see”.Delia has travelled from Banbridge. She is mortified and doesn’t want her surname used, but her memories are only good, of living near Tom in London, where he made ice cream or worked on sites by day and played music by night, “and would have done anything for you”.Breda O’Sullivan arrives after a long drive from Cashel, Co Tipperary - six hours including a half hour stop. She came on behalf of her mother Josie, who died four years ago. “She loved him.” She pauses. “He had great diction. You could always understand the words.” She is glad she came, and now she’s going to turn around and head home again.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465705.1524057090!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two cases of tb confirmed in cork school","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGlanmire Community College in Co Cork has confirmed that two pupils have been diagnosed with tuberculosis.

Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons On November 10th, 2016 the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which signs off on mergers and takeovers, approved Independent News \u0026amp Media’s planned takeover of Celtic Media Group.This came just over two months after INM announced that it wanted to take over the regional newspaper group, which owns the Anglo-Celt in Cavan, the Meath Chronicle and the Connaught Telegraph.The acquisition would have increased the size of the INM, the country’s largest media company, which already owned regional newspapers including The Kerryman, the Sligo Champion and the Wexford People.Legal papers filed by Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan last month in his bid to seek the appointment of High Court inspectors to INM reveal confidential contacts between various parties who had an interest in whether the merger should proceed, including Minister for Communications Denis Naughten. According to the sequence of events outlined by Drennan in his affidavit and emails reproduced in his court papers, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, the director of public affairs at public relations firm Heneghan PR, telephoned Minister Naughten on the afternoon of November 11th, 2016 about the takeover.Mr Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times this week he was hired by INM, a client of the PR firm, to find out the Minister’s reaction to the decision of the CCPC not to block the proposed takeover and to see if Naughten intended to refer to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, which signs off on mergers of media companies. The decision by the CCPC raising no competition concerns about the merger effectively put the proposed acquisition back on the minister’s desk for consideration.The CCPC reviews media mergers on their narrow economic impact, while the BAI examines proposed mergers on a cross-media ownership basis and whether it damages media plurality. An email sent by Nigel Heneghan, managing director of the firm where Ó Neachtain works, to INM’s then chairman Leslie Buckley at 9.36am on November 12th, 2016 outlines details of Ó Neachtain’s conversation with the minister the previous afternoon.Heneghan wrote that the minister told Ó Neachtain that based on the advice of his officials he would refer INM’s proposed acquisition of Celtic Media to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for review because of the level of ownership of media companies, broadcast and print, by Denis O’Brien, INM’s biggest shareholder.Heneghan concluded his email to Buckley telling him that this information was “to be treated as highly confidential as the minister has not been officially informed yet of the CCPC decision.” The email was, according to Drennan’s affidavit, forwarded by Buckley to O’Brien at 10.07am.Drennan claims that the information communicated by Buckley to O’Brien - including this November 12th, 2016 email - may fall within the definition of inside information given that INM is a public company and that, as a result, Buckley may potentially be in breach of stock market rules, namely Market Abuse Regulations.Ó Neachtain told The Irish Times this week the minister told him on their telephone call that, regardless of the CCPC’s decision, he was going to refer the proposed takeover to the BAI. On November 23rd 2016 the minister told The Irish Times in an interview he had not considered INM’s takeover of Celtic Media, despite his reported remarks to Ó Neachtain.“I haven’t got the recommendations yet from my officials and as soon as I do I will weigh all that up,” he told Irish Times journalist Laura Slattery in the interview, which was published in early December 2016.In a February 7th, 2017 reply to a parliamentary question, Naughten said that following approval of the merger by the CCPC, he received notification of the proposed merger on November 21st, 2016.In his reply, the minister said that he had 30 working days from the notification deadline of November 24th 2016 to conduct an initial assessment on whether the merger should proceed as it may be contrary to the public interest in protecting the plurality of the media in the State. Following this initial assessment, or “phase one examination,” he decided on January 10th, 2017 to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to conduct “a full media merger examination of the proposed transaction.” The BAI was given 80 days to examine if the takeover would be damaging media plurality in Ireland given that it would have increased INM’s ownership of regional newspapers from 13 to 20.In the end, INM and Celtic Media decided to walk away from the proposed deal by mutual consent in June 2017 shortly before the Minister was due to consider the BAI’s report on the acquisition.- Full text of email sent to then Independent News \u0026amp Media chairman Leslie Buckley by public relations executive Nigel Heneghan at 9.36am on November 12th, 2016. This refers to the conversation Eoghan Ó Neachtain, director of public relations at Mr Heneghan’s PR firm, had with Minister for Communications Denis Naughten the previous afternoon about his view of INM’s takeover of regional newspaper group, Celtic Media Group, after the decision of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission not to block the proposed acquisition. Mr Buckley forwarded Mr Heneghan’s email to businessman Denis O’Brien, a 29.9 per cent shareholder in INM, at 10.07am with the note: “FYI – Leslie”We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465450.1524036022!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.How the Southwest Airlines tragedy happenedTammie Jo Shults, a former Navy pilot, was at the controls when the plane made the emergency landing. She walked through the aisle and talked to passengers to make sure they were OK after the aircraft touched down.\u0026quotShe has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,\u0026quot said Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. \u0026quotI\u0027m going to send her a Christmas card, I\u0027m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.\u0026quotPilot Tammie Jo Shults was praised for her handling of the mid-air dramaIn a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, an unidentified crew member reported that there was a hole in the plane and \u0026quotsomeone went out.\u0026quotMr Tumlinson said a man in a cowboy hat rushed forward a few rows to grab the woman and pull her back in.\u0026quotShe was out of the plane. He couldn\u0027t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,\u0026quot he said.Passengers struggled to somehow plug the hole while giving the badly injured woman CPR.As the plane came in for a landing, everyone started yelling to brace for impact, then clapped after the aircraft touched down safely, Bourman said.The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window.The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s incident.It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotA Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida.Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Family, friends and community leaders are mourning the death of Mrs Riordan, a Wells Fargo bank executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was well known in New Mexico, where she had built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications after graduating from the University of New Mexico.Gov Susana Martinez called Mrs Riordan \u0026quotan incredible woman who put her family and community first\u0026quot and said her loss would be felt across the state.\u0026quotThe hearts of all New Mexicans are with the Riordan family,\u0026quot Ms Martinez, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday.Jennifer Riordan was described as \u0026#39an incredible woman\u0026#39Before starting with Wells Fargo in 2008, Mrs Riordan had worked for the University of New Mexico hospital system in public relations and for Citigroup.At Wells Fargo, she was the vice president for community relations and was in charge of managing employee volunteer and board service to nonprofit groups in New Mexico and parts of Texas. She also served on numerous boards and oversaw the annual United Way community campaign.Mike English, a spokesman for Wells Fargo in New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan \u0026quotwas a well-known leader who was loved and respected\u0026quot.Jennifer Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, had been married for more than 20 yearsAlbuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said his thoughts and prayers were with Riordan\u0027s family.\u0026quotToday, Albuquerque lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community,\u0026quot Mr Keller, a Democrat, said in a statement.Mr Keller said Mrs Riordan\u0027s leadership and philanthropic efforts \u0026quotmade this a better place every day and she will be terribly missed\u0026quot.State Attorney General Hector Balderas called Mrs Riordan a dear friend. \u0026quotI was honoured to work with her on financial literacy issues for over a decade,\u0026quot said Mr Balderas, a Democrat. \u0026quotJennifer was exceptionally active and passionate in working to improve our community, and I express our sincerest condolences to her husband and children.\u0026quotJennifer Riordan was returning from a business trip to New York Members of the broadcast community shared their condolences on social media, remembering the volunteer efforts and outreach spurred by Mrs Riordan through her many roles in the community.In a tweet, the New Mexico Broadcasters Association expressed its heartbreak over Mrs Riordan\u0027s death, noting that she was a former board member and scholarship winner.Mrs Riordan also served on the boards of Junior Achievement of New Mexico, New Mexico First and The Catholic Foundation.Ryan Cangiolosi, chairman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan loved Albuquerque and worked tirelessly to help others.\u0026quotHer leadership in numerous charitable causes made a real impact on our state and earned her the respect and admiration of New Mexicans across the political spectrum,\u0026quot Cangiolosi said.Mrs Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, a former chief operating officer for Albuquerque, had been married for more than 20 years.A lack of oxygen above 10,000ft means cabins have to be pressurised to ensure those on board can keep breathing. When the seal is broken - such as by a smashed window - compressed air rushes out, as conditions inside and outside the aircraft equalise.Chartered aeronautical engineer Guy Gratton said plane windows are thick and strong but \u0026quotlike anything else, they\u0027re capable of being broken\u0026quot.He said: \u0026quotIf you lose a window then you\u0027ve punched a hole in the pressure vessel. The air inside will try to escape.\u0026quotFor anybody close to that window, there\u0027s going to be an incredibly strong wind heading out. It\u0027s strong enough to suck somebody out of the window, potentially.\u0026quotMr Gratton outlined a number of other effects a severely damaged window could have.\u0026quotThe pressure will drop and the temperature will drop,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotQuite likely it will suddenly get foggy inside the cabin, it will be really noisy.\u0026quotLots of people will be getting popping of ears. The oxygen masks will all drop. That all happens in a couple of seconds.\u0026quotIn 1990, a poorly-fitted section of the windscreen of a British Airways aircraft blew off, causing the captain, Tim Lancaster, to be pulled halfway out at 17,000ft over Oxfordshire.Cabin crew held on to his legs and co-pilot Alastair Atchison made an emergency landing in Southampton, where Mr Lancaster was treated in hospital for frostbite and a broken arm.Two years earlier, an Aloha Airlines flight lost a section of its roof when a hole caused decompression.A flight attendant was sucked out of the plane and died, but everyone else on board was wearing their seatbelt and survived.Please review our commenting policyComment: Millennials like me who can\u0026#39t sew a button will soon come unstuck Russia threatens to block Facebook amid crackdown on Telegram messaging serviceYork to track mobile phone data in traffic pilot Ant McPartlin\u0026#39s comeback: the big questions, answeredTelegraph reader cracks two-year challenge of \u0026#39world\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 in two hoursJewish men beaten with belt in Berlin anti-Semitic attackUK enjoys hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveItalian language under siege from imported English words, warns Florence academyBitcoin heist suspect escapes to Sweden \u0026#39on board flight with Iceland\u0026#39s prime minister\u0026#39Comment: It should have been Jeremy Corbyn’s easiest PMQs.

Older people should also reduce physical exertion.“Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.”The NHS has even publicised its tips for coping in a heatwave including limiting going outside between 11am and 3pm, wearing lose-fitting clothing and staying hydrated.The London Fire Brigade has also urged people to resist the temptation to jump into any of the capital\u0027s rivers.However, not all parts of the country were basking in the sun shine as parts of Wales, Scotland and the North West reported overcast conditions.The warm spell is expected to last into the weekend and temperatures forecast to return to their seasonal norms of around 16C on Monday.Meanwhile London Marathon organisers are preparing for the hottest even yet as temperatures could be has high as 24C for the race. The previous warmest temperatures were just over 22C in 1996 and 2007The organisers told the BBC: \u0026quotWe have a number of contingency plans in place in case of hot weather and we will be sending advice to runners and spectators later in the week that will be proportionate to race day.\u0026quotFather and son enjoying the sun on Primrose Hill LondonThe unseasonably warm weather comes less than two month after the UK was blanketed under snow as the cold snap dubbed the Beast from the East gripped Europe.The snow caused widespread disruption with the RAF called in to transport health workers and more than £10 million damage done to vehicles in the UK.The cold snap also saw the coldest March day on record with a low maximum of -4.7C  recorded in Tredegar, in South East Wales.A sunbather in St James\u0026#39 Park determined to capitalise on short heat wave The bookmakers Coral has now made it odds on, at 4-5, that 2018 goes on to be the hottest year on record as amid a surge in bets.\u0026quotThe sun is shining and the bets are flying in for this year to go on to be the hottest we\u0027ve ever had,\u0026quot said Coral\u0027s Harry Aitkenhead. \u0026quotWith a tropical blast giving us a glorious April we certainly can\u0027t rule it out, making it odds on at this stage.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyComment: Millennials like me who can\u0026#39t sew a button will soon come unstuck Russia threatens to block Facebook amid crackdown on Telegram messaging serviceYork to track mobile phone data in traffic pilot Ant McPartlin\u0026#39s comeback: the big questions, answeredTelegraph reader cracks two-year challenge of \u0026#39world\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 in two hoursJewish men beaten with belt in Berlin anti-Semitic attackItalian language under siege from imported English words, warns Florence academyBitcoin heist suspect escapes to Sweden \u0026#39on board flight with Iceland\u0026#39s prime minister\u0026#39Comment: It should have been Jeremy Corbyn’s easiest PMQs.

This amounts to 100 weeks, or just over two years.\u0026quot  However, he did add that there would be people who would likely complete it faster than others.  Mr Lancaster commented that whilst the puzzle was reasonably challenging it was no harder that some of the Telegraph Toughie crosswords or Enigmatic Variations, adding: “I\u0027d expect anybody who can solve these to be able to crack Mr Breman\u0027s crossword within a few hours.”  The puzzle can be downloaded from Mr Breman\u0027s website, marcbreman.london.  The first 10 people to crack it were to receive a signed copy of his new book, \u0027The Foggiest Notion\u0027, which is itself based on a crossword puzzle.1 Leave after finding nothing in big rambling empty space (4,6)6 Tolerate swimming in sea that tastes of tarragon (9)14 Round a great deal, turning out hit that\u0027s within hearing (7)15 Some heat to cook rice, getting address in Spain back (7)16 People fail to perform with that woman\u0027s leaderless energy (8)18 American uncle has left grand in Wimbledon (4)21 Endless call to finish measurement system in the tube (6)23 Tune has audible pause and it slows down (3,5)27 Car blockade has husband running from Bonn to Berlin (8)29 Head of casting is apparent during whole film (4)31 Force redhead to leave ales out for sugar supplier...

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.How cognitive psychology makes sense of the Brexit voteSterling falls back from post-Brexit referendum highBrexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a \u0027fool\u0027s errand\u0027 by MPHow we can make the government give everyone a vote on the Brexit dealThe research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It bases this scenario on the Prime Minister’s recent Mansion House speech which outlined the Brexit she hopes to deliver.This would mean leaving the single market and customs union whilst maintaining access to EU markets with minimal tariff and non-tariff barriers. It would also include the flexibility to erge from Brussels regulations, negotiate trading relationships with other non-EU countries and implement restrictions on immigration.How cognitive psychology makes sense of the Brexit voteSterling falls back from post-Brexit referendum highBrexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a \u0027fool\u0027s errand\u0027 by MPHow we can make the government give everyone a vote on the Brexit dealThe research estimates that this outcome would leave the country better off than a no-deal Brexit but worse off than under the “Norway model” or under an average free-trade agreement such as the one Canada has with the EU.The Norway model, in which the UK would stay in the single market and adhere to EU rules and regulations but leave the customs union, would have a negative fiscal impact of £262m per week while the Canada option would cost around £877m per week, Mr Portes finds. The figures are the equivalent of  9 per cent and 31 per cent of the current NHS budget respectively. A no-deal Brexit in which the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organisation terms is estimated to cost £1.25bn per week. No scenario is more beneficial than staying in the EU.The analysis takes into account the benefits from lower financial contributions to the EU budget and a new trade deal with the US as well as costs arising from new customs controls, tariffs, and reduced migration. A survey conducted as part of the research found that 72 per cent of Leave voters thought that £615m a week would be too high a price to pay for a bespoke Brexit deal, while 78 per cent said it was worse than they had hoped for when they cast their vote in June 2016.Among all EU referendum voters polled, just 23 per cent said they thought the estimated cost would be worth paying.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Selfridges\u0027 Bobble 550ml filtered water bottle costs £12.95 and includes a replaceable carbon filter that filters water as you drink, removing chlorine and organic contaminants in the process. You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups. This Keep Cup Brew, cork edition, travel cup in Fika is just one of the many available to purchase.

These straws are handmade in Bali and crafted by local balinese artisans. Made of organic and natural materials they are the best eco-friendly alternative to plastic, steel or glass straws. You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy.

Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough.

It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was beautiful, but it\u0027s gone.Morrissey: An unapologetic mix of unpleasantness and fading brillianceHe added, My pride is with ‘Low In High School‘, ‘World Peace Is None Of Your Business‘, ‘Years Of Refusal‘, ‘Ringleader Of the Tormentors‘, ‘You Are The Quarry‘, ‘Swords’, ‘Southpaw Grammar’, ‘Your Arsenal’, ‘Vauxhall and I’ … they are me, whereas The Smiths was a great but simplistic time.Morrissey further expressed his adoration for his solo project saying he cannot imagine my life without those solo albums and added even ‘Maladjusted’!In the controversial interview, the 58-year-old musician also talked about being accused of racism, called Hitler left wing and claims London Mayor Sadiq Khan cannot talk properly.He also expressed his distaste for the lack of press around the band members of his solo band after an enormous image of The Smiths was in The Times. There can never be enough detail to look beyond The Smiths, or to write a headline that wasn’t a Smiths song, Morrissey said.Morrissey says he will never do another print interviewThe constant referral to his past in The Smiths he compared to people only associating David Bowie to The Laughing Gnome calling it a morbid sentimentality.Just as Morrissey is focused on his solo work, former Smiths band member Johnny Marr is set to release his third solo record Call The Comet on June 15.A Smiths reunion seems to look less and less likely.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The situation is made more urgent by the fact that the UK cannot even begin to negotiate replacement deals with other countries until it has left the EU.“It has become clear that negotiating our trade framework after Brexit will be a complex and time-consuming matter,” the MEPs wrote in the letter.“As political representatives of farmers and food exporters we are deeply concerned that the underestimation of the difficulty of this process should not impact negatively on them and hence on British trade.Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP representing the strongly rural and agricultural South West, and one of the letter’s signatories, said: “Liam Fox’s infamous claim that securing a trade deal with the EU post Brexit would be the ‘easiest in human history’ has been exposed as total bluster and bravado. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

russia","story":"International chemical weapons inspectors\u0026nbspfinally set to visit\u0026nbspsite of the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.Theresa May says ‘element of surprise’ was crucial in Syria bombingThe development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.Syria bombing: EU ‘understands’ recent airstrikes but calls for ‘urgent’ resumption of peace talks“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.Chemical weapons inspectors have entered Douma, Syrian media says‘Very likely’ evidence

– one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Kenneth Clarke criticises Theresa May for failure to consult parliament over Syria bombingSpeaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel to the site on Wednesday.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has flatly denied that Russia had “tampered” with the evidence, and insisted there is no proof that chemical weapons had even been used in Douma.Douma chemical attack: Syria war in picturesDouma chemical

dangerous development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are part of us and I want to be absolutely clear that we have no intention of asking anyone to leave who has the right to remain here, Ms May told MPs.For those who have mistakenly received letters challenging them I want to apologise them and I want to say sorry to anyone who has been caused confusion and anxiety as a result of this.Theresa May apologises to those affected by Windrush deportation errorsThe majority of citizens who arrived before 1971 will have the documentation to prove their status, but the small number who do not will receive urgent help from the Home Office, she said.Thousands of people are believed to lack the documents they need to prove their immigration, under the “hostile environment” for suspected illegal immigrants introduced by Ms May when she was home secretary.Affected citizens will not be “left out of pocket” while they establish their credentials to meet new government rules, the prime minister has promised.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her.” Passengers gave CPR to Ms Riordan, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, while others struggled to plug the window as pilots began a rapid descent before performing an emergency landing in Philadelphia.Passengers did “some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances”, said Philadelphia fire commissioner Adam Thiel. Ms Riordan later died from her injuries. She is the first person to die in an accident involving a US airline in nine years.Her Facebook page shows she was married to husband Michael and had two children.In a statement issued to Texas TV news station WFAA, her family said: “Jennifer’s vibrancy, passion and love infused our community and reached across our country. Her impact on everything and everyone she touched can never be fully measured.“But foremost, she is the bedrock of our family. She and Mike wrote a love story unlike any other. Her beauty and love is evident through her children.”Before she set off, she sent a tweet showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan, captioning the photo: “Great business stay.”Jennifer Riordan was flying home from a business trip when she was killed (AP)Ms Riordan led volunteer work in New Mexico and built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications.Mike English, a spokesman for Wells Fargo in New Mexico, said Ms Riordan “was a well-known leader who was loved and respected”. Seven other passengers on the plane suffered minor injuries.Some of the 149 people on board said prayers as they braced for impact before landing, using oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling during the descent.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,” said Amanda Bourman, of New York. “And the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn’t grow up without parents.“Everybody was crying and upset. You had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, ‘It’s OK. We’re going to do this’.” Passengers clapped as the jet landed at 11.27am on Tuesday and praised pilot Tammie Jo Shults for averting a disaster.Shrapnel from the plane’s engine smashed through the plane’s window forcing and emergency landing (Marty Martinez)“She has nerves of steel,” said Mr Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. “That lady, I applaud her.

She was awesome.” Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed Flight 1380 was heading west over Pennsylvania at about 32,200 feet and travelling 500 mph when pilots were forced to abruptly ert to Philadelphia. In a recorded conversation between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, the pilot is heard asking for emergency services to be ready for the landing.Ms Shults, a former US Navy fighter pilot, said at the time: “Could you have the medical meet us there on the runway as well. We’ve got injured passengers.”Asked if the plane was on fire, she said: “Not on fire but part of it is missing.

The airline’s chief executive officer Gary Kelly said there were no problems with the plane or engine when it was last examined.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators would take the plane’s engine apart to understand what happened and will look at maintenance records for the engine.Southwest said Ms Riordan’s death was the first fatality of its kind in the carrier’s 51-year history.Republican governor of New Mexico Susana Martinez paid tribute to “an incredible woman who put her family and community first”, and said her loss would be felt across the state. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesTurkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announces early presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, 2018, at the Presidential Palace, in Ankara.
