Parliament agreed and rejected the proposal. Now, 150 years later, Houghton is a forgotten figure. That proposal, however, has been entrenched in British law. The government enjoys far greater “transcendental power” to deprive Britons of citizenship than even Gladstone could have imagined.A flurry of recent cases, from the revocation of Shamima Begum’s citizenship, to the deportation to Jamaica of people the government regards as “foreign criminals”, to the Windrush scandal, reveals the consequences. Each case is distinct. Begum’s is about the ability of the government to revoke the citizenship of a British-born person. The deportations raise the question of whether iniduals, many of whom came here as children, should be seen as “foreign” because they committed a crime when, had they not done so, they might have been seen as British. At the heart of the Windrush scandal are British citizens whom the authorities refused to see as such. What links them is a transformation in our perception of citizenship.“Will the minister confirm that British citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” asked Suella Braverman, the new attorney general, during last week’s Commons debate on the deportations to Jamaica. Home Office minister Kevin Foster was happy to confirm that it was.In 1870, MPs viewed citizenship as a right that should not be arbitrarily removed by the state. Today, it is viewed as a privilege, which many possess only under sufferance. Houghton recognised what many no longer do: that the revocation of citizenship is an extraordinary step that not only shatters lives but can tear at the moral fabric of the nation.It was in 1914, in wartime, that a government first successfully acquired the power to deprive Britons of their citizenship. Later laws, including the 1981 British Nationality Act, which redefined citizenship, affirmed the government’s right to do so. It was, though, a power used lightly. During the First World War, fewer than 40 Britons had their nationality revoked. During the Second World War, the numbers involved were even smaller: just four.Not until this century, in the wake of the 911 terror attacks and against a background of growing anxiety over immigration and multiculturalism, did the debate take a different turn. The overriding issue became not an unwillingness to provide the government with “transcendental power” but the belief that certain people did not deserve to be British.In a series of laws in the 00s, Labour allowed government to deprive anyone of citizenship, even if they had been born in Britain, if it was “conducive to the public good” to do so. After 2010, the coalition government went further. The 2014 Immigration Act institutionalised a “hostile environment” and allowed for revocation of citizenship even where a person may be left stateless.It’s not just the numbers that are startling but the two-tier system that is being created. As terrorism expert Shiraz Maher said: “Anyone with recourse to other citizenship (regardless of their connection to that country) is effectively being told their ‘Britishness’ is contingent upon continued good behaviour.” This would apply to “all children of immigrants, all Jews and everyone from Northern Ireland”. For what Maher calls the “British-British” – those without recourse to another citizenship – “their citizenship is protected and exists into perpetuity”.Because these changes apply primarily to jihadists or to criminals, most people support them. But the powers acquired by the state, and the discriminatory system being established, effect us all. MPs in 1870 understood that. We should do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035a2d20ab1e782c7bf01e52805126f3c96a77dc/0_278_4652_2791/master/4652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b482c0f152d3d3f778ad5029da8864ae","title":"keir starmer past scrutiny","story":"I remember in July 2008 when the news broke of the decision to appoint Keir Starmer as director of public prosecutions (DPP). I was at a meeting of socialist lawyers, people who had spent their lives campaigning for the rights of homeless people and asylum seekers. We couldn’t understand why he’d taken the role.On standing for the Labour leadership, Keir Starmer published a video, setting out his record as a barrister who had represented poll tax protesters and striking miners. “I don’t think anyone,” a voiceover says, “really expected someone who dedicated his career to defending workers, trade unions and trade unions to become director of public prosecutions.” They were right about that.As a barrister, Starmer was a principled opponent of state power. He was one of us. But the DPP’s role is all about exercising power: prosecuting defendants so that they are fined or jailed. Starmer’s time as DPP has played a role in the Labour leadership contest, particularly in blogs and on social media – and will be studied even more closely if he wins. What should we make of it?As DPP, Starmer was the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. This is the body that decides whether or not to prosecute someone accused of a crime. Where the decision is taken to prosecute, it is the CPS that employs a lawyer to argue in court for a conviction. The CPS is a huge organisation, undertaking more than half a million prosecutions a year, and employing almost 6,000 people.There were a number of decisions that Starmer got right. He was appointed by Labour but spent half his time in office under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. There, he defended the Human Rights Act against Conservative proposals to repeal it. Rightwing MPs briefed against him. Starmer deserves recognition for taking that stand.There is a second group of decisions taken by the CPS for which Starmer has been criticised, but it is difficult to say whether the criticisms are justified. The “most difficult” decision was, according to Starmer, in relation to the killing of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor who was struck by police officer Simon Harwood during protests in 2009.Although between 30 and 50 people die each year in police custody or following contact with the police, these deaths almost never lead to prosecution. In that context, the left demanded Harwood’s prosecution.Starmer told the press that the CPS wouldn’t prosecute. He cited the report of Dr Freddy Patel, the pathologist appointed by the state, who found the death had been caused by natural causes. Although other pathologists disagreed with Patel, the CPS insisted that the fact of his opinion was an insuperable barrier to prosecution. In October 2010, Dr Patel was suspended from practice as a result of allegations concerning the way he undertook autopsies. The CPS again announced that Harwood would not be prosecuted. Only in May 2011, after an inquest jury had found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, did the CPS agree to charge Harwood with manslaughter.The difficulty in criticising Starmer for his handling of this case – or others like it – is that we don’t know what advice he was given. If senior prosecutors were advising him against proceeding, he can’t be faulted for caution. After all, what would be the point of prosecution, if it was highly likely that the officer was going to be acquitted? Which, in 2012, Harwood was.Where Starmer’s record may be more vulnerable to criticism is in his handling of the press. One of the DPP’s tasks is to issue guidance to prosecutors. The guidance reminds prosecutors of the powers already available to them. Usually, the guidance is not controversial. For example, in November last year, the CPS offered guidance on prosecuting offences under the Theft Act. As far as I can tell, no paper reported on that guidance its publication was seen as the routine act of a government department.His critics are able to exaggerate his role because of interviews given by Starmer himself in which he presented modest changes to the advice given to prosecutors as matters of real significance and used a tabloid-friendly language to defend them. This was how he justified the guidance on protests: “There’s a potential for a number of protests over the coming years that may be quite large … If someone has brought along a weapon or means of concealing their identity that’s likely to be evidence that they were anticipating trouble or disorder.”In fact, over the past two decades, it has become more common for demonstrators to cover their faces. They do so because of the increasing use of snatch squads, police filming of political protests and scandals such as detention without arrest. When Starmer called for the vigorous pursuit of protesters who have concealed their identity, he was playing up to press fantasies about their motives.This, meanwhile, is how Starmer explained his guidance to prosecutors in benefits cases: “It is a myth that ‘getting one over on the system’ is a victimless crime: the truth is we all pay the price” and “It is vital that we take a tough stance on this type of fraud and I am determined to see a clampdown on those who flout the system.”The largest group of benefits prosecutions concern the minor infractions of people who fail to declare a piece of information. For example, when part-time workers on housing benefit fail to tell the authorities that their hours at work have increased. Starmer’s words (“getting one over on the system”) were wide enough so that it seemed he was referring to such groups of claimants. And, in doing so, he evoked tabloid myths about undeserving iniduals deliberately and systematically milking the system. To speak of claimants in this way was to denigrate them.Looking back on Starmer’s management of the media while DPP, the sense is of an inidual with a radical past making peace with power. He was at ease there in a way that Jeremy Corbyn, among others, could never have been.His supporters will say that Labour needs a leader capable of winning press support. To which his critics will counter that the rightwing press is already ungenerously studying Starmer’s career. It is a mistake to think that his close proximity to high-profile cases will be anything other than a recurring weak point in relation to the tabloids.Starmer’s enthusiasm while DPP for using mundane news events to feed the press with rightwing talking points is a possible concern for Labour members. If such a leader was faced with news of an injustice in the future – the consequence of a change to immigration rules, say, or of a strike in public services – Starmer’s approach to the press as DPP might raise worries that he would not give a principled defence of the victims but would tell the press whatever it wanted to hear.• David Renton is a political activist and barrister.

Offered the opportunity to make a billion from launching the next big tech startup, I bet most would sign up without a second thought.For many, being wealthy is to be aspired to rather than derided or resented. This is one of the findings of new research on public attitudes to the rich, undertaken by academics at Loughborough, Birmingham and the LSE (and funded by the Trust for London, of which I am a trustee). It explored whether there is a public consensus about the level beyond which wealth becomes excessive or undesirable for society.The report should top the reading list for candidates to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. It turns out most people do not view the wealthy in the way the left wishes it would. In focus groups, most people acknowledged that excess wealth brings problems such as disproportionate political influence. But they did not, on the whole, feel angry with the rich if anything, the reverse held. While they were less keen on those who did not earn their wealth, they admired people they thought had worked hard to make it.It is easy to see how Labour ended up where it did. The biggest challenge facing the left is how to win in the face of the toxic populism that has been embraced by leaders on the right, from Boris Johnson to Donald Trump. Its “them versus us” narrative is anathema to progressive change: the idea of a corrupt elite set against the people further undermines trust in political institutions and it gains traction by inviting voters to blame groups, from immigrants to benefit recipients, for society’s ills.One school of thought is that the left should try to beat the right at their own game: replace immigrants with bankers, benefit scroungers with billionaires and you get something approaching the Labour campaign. The starting point seemed to be that sufficient numbers of voters are committed Marxists, if only they’d just realise it. And Labour assumed the public would get its vague allusions to “the few” – who they are and why they are a bad thing. Its manifesto referred to a “wealth grab by the privileged few” without unpacking what that meant and did not explain why people with more should contribute more in taxes – it just assumed this was self-evident.Labour seemed to assume that bringing voters onside was just a case of arguing the case more forcefully, rather than framing the arguments in terms that chime with people’s own values and beliefs. And so its campaign felt more like turning out the morally pure rather than persuading swing voters.This is consistent with new research about to be published by Tax Justice UK that found that, when making the case for a more progressive tax system, bashing the wealthy resonated far less well with voters than specific arguments about closing loopholes and increasing particular taxes. It might be less sexy than talk of predatory wealth extractors, but it is more effective. The left might also do well to focus on the instrumental rather than the moral case: tax as a building block for a better society rather than as a way to punish the undeserving rich.Hawkins warns that the left must be wary of broadbrush “them v us” narratives: not only are they not very effective, they can create a harmful spillover. Research by the New Economics Foundation found public thinking about the economy is deeply fatalistic: there is considerable scepticism about the power of politicians to make it fairer. Talking about how rigged the system is, as Corbyn has done, risks further embedding that sense of fatalism.It may be tempting to see the rewards reaped by the right from whipping up anger and feeding off resentment and to hope that progressive politicians could emulate that success by changing the target for something more legitimate. But the left should exercise caution before embracing populist tactics: they should be used sparingly, if at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c751353d21560ebe04fa34b853c21f8b54264f/334_472_3779_2267/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24d3c29134f00532af8ac94e0d06a62","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of clash","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘clash’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘clash’.Share your photos of what clash means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 19 February at 10am.

Manchester University maths students in a 600-capacity hall were given slips with a link to a YouTube live stream and told they could “sit in a coffee shop” and watch. They were also given the option of sitting in a separate overflow theatre to watch the stream, without being able to participate or question lecturers.Last October, the University of Nottingham advertised a £9.65-an-hour role for a temporary worker to monitor the overflow live stream for first-year law students. In November, psychology students at the University of Lancaster were sent to overflow rooms and given the option to watch lessons on their laptops because lecture theatres were full..Overflow rooms typically accommodate large audiences when well-known figures give public lectures. All the named universities said that overflow classes were a short-term arrangement to cover busy periods at the beginning of the academic year.Sofija (who declined to give her surname), a student at the University of Manchester who attended the maths lecture, told the Observer that she saw people being turned away. The economics undergraduate decided to stop going to the class because it was so difficult to concentrate.The National Union of Students, which represents higher education students, said that packed lectures were a result of “desperate” universities being forced to bring in as much tuition-fee income as possible.In a separate example of overcrowding, a physics lecture at King’s College London, one of 24 universities in the elite Russell Group, was reportedly so busy that students were told to “cram” in, with some standing at the back.Julio Figueroa, an international student from Mexico who pays more than £25,000 a year to study at King’s College London, said that he had to take his own chair into a physics lecture on at least two occasions. “We are in a Russell Group university, I feel like this shouldn’t happen,” he said.There is no evidence of the university running overflow lectures, and it said it had no knowledge of students taking their own chairs into lectures.Universities UK, which represents higher education providers, said it was important that all students could access lectures. “Universities will be mindful to ensure this does not compromise the quality of teaching or disadvantage students not attending in person. There is no indication of common or continuing issues with students being asked to join overflow or online lectures against their wishes,” a spokesperson said.The University of Manchester said that the maths overflow was temporary. “When overcrowding does occur, we work with schools to resolve it as quickly as possible and use various solutions, including moving the lecture to a larger location or splitting the cohort into smaller groups.”Nottingham said its overflow lecture was the result of a timetabling problem that affected a small number of students. “For a two-week period last September, a particular set of law lectures proved more popular than anticipated for the allocated theatre capacity,” it said. “Rather than disappoint students, we arranged a live stream of the lecture for some 20 students in the adjoining theatre, with full technical support and additional tutorials to ensure they could explore the lecture topic in person with tutors.”Lancaster said it had run overflow lectures owing to the popularity of its course. “There is always a staff member present in the streamed venue and there are mechanisms in place so students can ask questions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea6d012422bd0fe5c1c80c20d6aa5f676a8b4cf/0_1674_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d081e7d0f344d75297f915d8f207fc3","title":"spring clean the key looks from the new collections in pictures","story":"Power shoulders, pastels, frills and black tie dressing, we take some of the trends from the SS20 season for a spin• Read more from the springsummer 2020 edition of The Fashion, our biannual style supplement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9b45ba6bd588ea2eac64e2a335daae8a84a0fb/0_115_5114_3068/master/5114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c405e6b64f250f55d0a01d83b069f8f1","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury deliberations","story":"The #MeToo movement received barely a mention at the movie mogul’s rape trial but is likely to bear heavily on deliberationsThe jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world’s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them.The five women and seven men who form the jury hold in their hands the fate of the disgraced movie mogul. If they find him guilty of two of the five counts against him, of “predatory sexual assault”, he could be sentenced to life in prison.Since the trial began last month, the jurors have constantly been reminded of intense media interest in the case.Prosecutors and Weinstein’s lawyers have frequently directed jurors’ vision to the overflowing press benches in courtroom No 99 at the New York supreme court, and alluded to the sound of keyboards rattling as one way of highlighting the high-profile nature of the case.The process of reaching a verdict will not be easy or brief. The first trial of Bill Cosby, the comedian whose prosecution is often compared to that of Weinstein, ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to agree after six gruelling days of deliberations.Cosby was found guilty at a second trial and sentenced in 2018 to three to 10 years in prison.There are two main accusers in the Weinstein case.Miriam Haley was working as a production assistant in 2006 when she alleges Weinstein lured her to his SoHo apartment in New York and forced oral sex on her.A woman who the  is not identifying, as she has not indicated that she wishes to be publicly named, alleges she was raped in a New York hotel in 2013.Weinstein, 67, has also been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 100 women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.In the New York trial, four women who accuse the producer of rape and sexual assault – Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, Dawn Dunning, Tarale Wulff and Lauren Young – were called by the prosecution to give supporting evidence.In closing arguments, Weinstein’s lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, and lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon presented the jury with starkly contrasting summaries of the case.Though #MeToo, the social reckoning galvanised by the accusations of sexual abuse levelled against the Pulp Fiction producer since 2017, has rarely been mentioned in court, it has clearly influenced the lawyers’ diametrically opposing interpretations of the case in hand.Rotunno has portrayed the six women as money-grabbing, manipulative iniduals who exploited Weinstein in order to advance their careers. According to that view, they were prepared to do anything – including consensual sex – in order to get on.On Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon gave a very different analysis. Weinstein, she said, treated women who he tricked into entering his lair like “ants he could step on without consequences”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291ca14579ad73214ca579cc13936273e1bcd695/0_0_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df3ae6acd13401bfc9cfa59dfd1af9de","title":"parasite film oscars bong joon ho seoul rich poor south korea","story":"Few would begrudge South Koreans their moment of joy after Parasite’s historic success at the Oscars. Not only was Bong Joon-ho’s film the first non-English language production in the Academy Awards’ 92-year history to win best picture – one of four Oscars on the night for the director and his crew – it was long-overdue recognition by the global movie industry of the brilliance of South Korean cinema.But the celebrations, led by the country’s president, Moon Jae-in, concealed an uncomfortable truth about Bong’s masterpiece. Centring on the tension between the Kims, a basement-dwelling family of “dirt spoons” in Seoul, and the Parks, a family at the opposite end of the social spectrum, Parasite’s plot is predicated on the widening gap between the haves and the have nots in Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.Moon, a liberal who came to power in 2017 promising to create jobs, redistribute wealth and weaken the power of the chaebol – the family-run firms that drove postwar development – praised Parasite as a “uniquely Korean story”.The film exposes the paradox at the heart of a country better known around the world for its technological prowess and pop music.While scenes from the Parks’ spacious designer home and the Kims’ slum basement flat were shot on purpose-built sets, it draws its realism from those set in deprived neighbourhoods a world away from the exclusive Gangnam neighbourhood in the city’s south.They include Ahyeon-dong near central Seoul – a district of crumbling brick buildings where rents for half-basement flats have doubled in the past decade – and narrow streets perched on a hillside dotted with steep concrete staircases, all in sight of gleaming high-rise apartments for the rich. By contrast, the scenes around the Parks’ sprawling home were filmed in Seongbuk-dong, where the streets are immaculately clean and homeowners go about their lives behind high walls and spiked security fences.While living standards in South Korea are on a par with those in the UK, young people in particular are worried about an increasingly uncertain economic future in which surviving the cut-throat education system no longer guarantees them a well-paid job for life. And they have little to look forward to in retirement, with figures showing that a large proportion of older South Koreans are living in poverty.Bong’s stinging – and at times hilarious – commentary on the friction generated by poverty’s proximity to wealth could bring financial benefits to some of Ahyeon-dong’s residents, however, via guided tours planned by the city government.One of the tours takes in five locations around Seoul that have resonated with Parasite audiences, including the Pig Rice supermarket where Ki-woo, the Kims’ 20-something son, drinks soju spirit with a friend, a concrete stairway in a nearby alleyway that leads to the Kim family’s semi-basement flat, the Jahamun road tunnel, and the Sky Pizza parlour that employs the family to fold boxes for a pittance.Last week, stray dogs and cats roamed the streets, while young women took selfies, and photographers and TV crews filmed the shop.“My husband and I thought it was such an honour for our shop to appear in Parasite,” its 72-year-old owner, Kim Kyung-soon, says. “Then we saw the news about the Oscars. The film kept winning and winning. We stayed up celebrating all night, along with everyone else in South Korea.”But not everyone is happy, with one resident concerned that interest in its dilapidated architecture would put a halt to rumoured redevelopment plans. “If the Parasite tours take off, there will be pressure to preserve these buildings and that will mean the end of the redevelopment plan,” he says. “That would be a disaster. We’ve been waiting for it for years. The ceiling in my place is leaking water and we are biding our time until the day we can move out. We don’t want our neighbourhood to stay like this because of a movie.”But Um Hang-gi, the owner of Sky Pizza, where sales have soared since the Oscars, is savouring the attention. “Just think of all the upstarts in our society who get rich quick through deceit and scheming,” says Um, who has placed a poster in the window lauding her business’s minor role in Bong’s success. “They don’t care who gets hurt.”Despite having seen the film three times, Lee Seung-jin, a 28-year-old designer who lives nearby, says he is offended by the idea of “poverty tourism”. “Parasite is a parody about the gap between the rich and the poor, so for city officials to come up with the idea for these tours is ridiculous. Shouldn’t they be working to narrow the wealth gap instead of parading poor people around for tourists to gawp at?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08905d8ea67e4263690116e3beb56c446c44ee23/0_1535_5038_3021/master/5038.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47758186a77ff1bcd2a12edbc37c84f5","title":"nigel slater retro pudding dessert poached pear banana trifle custard","story":"Late winter is the perfect time to revisit retro puddingsThe blood oranges are irresistible at the moment, each fruit shot through with pink like the sky on a winter’s morning. I bought a dozen this week, each with their green leaves in place, and laid them out on a wooden tray on the kitchen counter. Luminous, they poured sunlight on the greyest of days. Later, I squeezed the juice from two of them, stirred in a glass of walnut-coloured sherry and used the result to soak slices of lemon sponge for a winter trifle. I made custard, a thick version with cream and egg yolks and a little sugar, then stirred in slices of almost ripe, perfectly unblemished banana.People have long fought over whether bananas belong in trifle. I insist they do. They are good friends to the custard, cream and sponge of the traditional recipe. This time, I flavoured the custard with cardamom which, with cinnamon, is a banana’s favourite spice.The glow of seasonal oranges aside, there is little of interest in terms of fruit right now. Luckily there are pears still worth eating, especially the plump-bottomed comice. Thirty years ago, there was barely a restaurant menu in the land without pears in red wine on it. It has to be said that many of those glossy syrups tasted too much like cough mixture, which was often down to a heavy hand with the cloves and bay. I returned to the idea this week, cooking the hard fruit with red wine, sweetly spiced with a star or two of anise and half a vanilla pod. I then lifted the pears out and bubbled the cooking liquid down to a blackcurrant-coloured syrup. The dish is about the balance of sugar and spice, but the poaching liquid needs to be quite sweet in order to tease out the flavour of the pears. It is worth remembering that it is the intense sweetness of the syrup that makes canned pears so good.Take the cooking of the fruit as far as you dare, so each pear is truly tender. Your spoon should be able to slide effortlessly through the butter-soft flesh.Pears are notoriously capricious and can take anything from 15-50 minutes to poach to tenderness. You need to keep your eye on them. A metal skewer or small, sharp knife is a boon here, and they should be checked every 5 minutes or so during cooking.

Add the stars anise, cloves, vanilla pod, cinnamon and sugar. Crack open the cardamom pods with a heavy weight, such as a pestle or rolling pin, then drop them into the wine and bring it to a simmer.Peel the pears, keeping them whole, their stems attached to hold them by. Lower them into the saucepan, then adjust the heat so the liquid continues at a light simmer. Let the pears cook until they are just tender, checking their progress regularly with the point of a knife. The cooking time can be anything from 15-50 minutes depending on the ripeness of your fruit.Remove the pan from the heat. Scoop them gently from the cooking liquor with a large spoon, then set them aside in a bowl or shallow plate. Place the pan over a high heat and bring the cooking liquor to a bubble, then continue cooking until it has reduced to less than 500ml. Taste the syrup for sweetness, adding a little more sugar if you wish.Break the chocolate into small pieces and leave to melt in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Finely chop the pistachios.Halve the pears lengthways and place them in shallow dishes. Pour over the red wine syrup and scatter with pistachios. Decant the chocolate into a small jug and pour a little over each pear at the table.Once you return the custard to the heat, stir pretty much continuously until it thickens a little. If it becomes grainy you have overheated it. Pour into a chilled bowl set over a bowl of ice cubes and beat hard with a whisk.Serves 6sponge cake 250g, Madeira or lemonblood oranges 2lemons 2sherry 100ml, medium-sweet, such as oloroso double cream 500mlcardamom pods 10vanilla extractegg yolks 4caster sugar 3 tbspbananas 3To decorate:double cream 250mllemon or ginger biscuits 3, crushedorange zest of 1Break the sponge into small pieces and place in the bottom of a serving dish.

Beat the yolks and sugar together then pour the cream over and combine.

At a stroke of Uefa’s judicial hand Manchester City have been transformed into an outlaw team. From here the future looks not just uncertain, but fraught with peril.It is impossible to predict the endgame of Uefa’s startling decision to ban the reigning English champions from European competitions for two seasons. For City supporters the response will no doubt be one of weary defiance. Perhaps there might be some gallows consolation to be found in the fact history suggests they don’t stand to lose too much in any case.A few desultory midweek home games. A VAR-inspired outrage, with attendant basement conspiracy theories. A quarter-final defeat to a heavyweight European power where Pep Guardiola gets the tactics wrong and sits looking sad and frail in his dugout.At the very least the home leg against Real Madrid next month should generate a bit of atmosphere. The edicts on not booing the Uefa anthem will no doubt be strictly observed.This feels like a much wider tipping point for European club football, for a particular model of ownership and, above all, for the management and playing personnel at the Etihad. City have been a wonderful champion team. Right now they look like a butterfly in danger of having its wings picked off.City’s hierarchy will appeal against the ban and fine, no doubt with the same contemptuous aggression they have contested these financial charges from the start. Billionaires, let the record note, really don’t like being told what to do.But barring some unusually rapid judicial process, it is hard to see exactly how they can hope to keep Guardiola. There has been a feeling the manager might be on his way. This is an issue that will take some time to settle. More immediate, and indeed related, is the question of how City hope to go on paying their players.There has been something oddly reckless about this project from the start, the sense of a beautiful team running on air. Never apologise, never explain: even relative failure this season in the league has come on Guardiola’s own terms, with the refusal to go through the prosaic business of strengthening his defence, in the process also weakening his team’s midfield.For all the good husbandry and good habits, the fine coaching, the refusal to splurge on superstars, City have still spent £340m net in transfer fees since Guardiola has been at the club, and hundreds of millions before that, all the while failing to produce a single homegrown first-team regular. Was it ever sustainable? Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, might just have had a point all along. The numbers really don’t add up.On one side of this equation City have the third-highest wage bill in world football at £300m. At the same time City have the fifth-largest income. Take out that self-fuelling Etihad sponsorship deal and they’re back in eighth. An inability to grow their commercial income has been the sticking point.The grace note is the growth in broadcast income. Crucially it is here City stand to lose under the Uefa ban. Third in wages, fifth in income might look wonky but without their Uefa income the balance goes through the floor, with some estimates suggesting a loss of European football could cost between £100m-£150m per year.This would leave an apocalyptic hole, one that makes the current squad simply unsustainable. City recently handed new deals to a rump of first-team regulars, which hardly eases the basic problem of how to keep the lights on.Perhaps worse, a significant number of City’s most desirable assets will enter the last two years of their deals during the ban. Fernandinho, Leroy Sané and Sergio Agüero are all out of contract in June 2021. Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan are free to leave in 2023.Good luck trying to persuade a crop of high-class, mid-career elite level players to miss two years of top-table football. Plus agents come into this. Contracts will contain force majeure clauses. Nobody wants to become cold product or to lose the bonuses associated with the Champions League.At the same time the squad is ageing. City’s best midfielder is 34, their best striker 31. This was always looking like a time to rebuild. Instead it looks like a moment of total flux.There aren’t enough takers out there to house all of these supremely well-paid players, raising the vague threat of an unseemly jostle for the door, of expedient loans, of captive princes on draining contracts.If the ban sticks it is hard to see past this disaster scenario. The greatest decade in Manchester City’s modern history is over. They’ll be going round this town shouting “bring out your dead”.A little dramatic perhaps. We are some way off this. But no doubt plenty will cheer at the prospect and not only for tribal reasons. There is an argument FPP shouldn’t exist at all, the suggestion any kind of restraint or protectionism is simply pulling up the rope ladder.Slightly absurd arguments have been made that the state-funded entity that owns City is being unfairly excluded from sport’s global elite, that it should be able to storm its way instantly to the top table simply by virtue of possessing unanswerable fossil fuel revenues. It is the kind of view you can only entertain if, at bottom, you really do like billionaires.These arguments will be tested, by implication, at the court of arbitration for sport. City may be exonerated. For now the rules exist and City have been held to have broken them, in a notably graceless manner.As such their success will be tainted, achievements that have out of necessity deprived others of glory, spending that has inflated the market, unsettled players, depleted opponents.But whatever the morality here – and history will withhold its verdict for now — it is impossible not to feel a note of sadness. For all the surrounding murk and the money spent, the rules bent, the arrogance of the club hierarchy, City under Guardiola have also been the most beautiful team of the Premier League era.Forget the stain of over-spending. We’ll always have that 100-point season. We’ll always have 15-0 across eight days against Liverpool, Feyenoord and Watford. We’ll always have that 44-pass goal against Manchester United, almost 1,000 passes against Swansea, the way the ball seems to become a living, mischievous thing, skittering about between the light blue shapes in a shared, rotational choreography.We’ll always have that moment at the Etihad last February against Chelsea where Agüero scored a goal so stunning – an explosive moment of skill, but also a kind of coronation for his team – that the whole ground fell silent for a second, then broke into a swell of gentle applause as the replay appeared on the big screen.This isn’t over. Billionaires don’t like to lose. City’s statement in reply to the judgment has its own notes of vengefulness, a firm hint that this process has by no means run its course. Let’s remember the best of that City team, and with kindness too. In the most practical sense, we may not see their like again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54f7fa9cfe39c44237f0d8bf58fb0df1768134ec/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=708e6a33dd6148f313ac0e1331346609","title":"manchester city fans blame envious old order clubs uefa ban","story":"Across the road from the vertiginous south stand of Manchester City’s stadium, a glut of conspiracy theories was already swirling among the early-afternoon loyalists at Mary D’s Bar.Minutes after opening its doors at midday on Saturday, the landlord, Mick Kehoe, was rehearsing the already well-versed sense of persecution that had gripped the club’s supporters since the unwanted news of the night before.The Friday evening bulletins had revealed that Manchester City had been banned from the Champions League for the next two seasons after being judged to have committed “serious breaches” of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations.Kehoe was fuming. “A lot of City fans are feeling that their club has been made a scapegoat. We feel there’s a bit of jealousy, a bit of conspiracy, because Uefa have always had it in for us,” said the 62-year-old whose pub is the closest to the Etihad Stadium.In fact, the hostelry was serving drinks to east Manchester for close to a decade before the stadium was built in 2002. Now, on match days, it is crammed to its 1,200 capacity by supporters, many of whom will crave more than ever that their club should lift the Champions League trophy in three months’ time.“What’s happened is seismic, but what actually happens if City win the biggest competition in Europe this year and then the Premier League next year and the year after?”Five minutes’ walk from May D’s lies another famous City pub, The Townley. Inside, licensee Pauline Carroll was similarly seething. And, like Kehoe, the 50-year-old was not slow to share the sense that her club, the reigning Premier League champions, had been unfairly targeted by Uefa following simmering tensions since 2014 when City were fined £49m for a previous breach of regulations.“There’s a prejudice against City and it’s not the first time Uefa have had it in for us. My two sons reacted in pure disbelief when they heard and, talking to people on social media and various supporters groups, everyone agrees it’s just a way of getting at us. The worst thing is that a lot of people were not even that surprised,” said Carroll.In a robust statement issued shortly after Uefa’s decision was made public, even the club said they were “not surprised” by the judgment. Describing the punishment as “prejudicial”, Manchester City have said they will appeal against the penalty, which also includes a €30m (£25m) fine.Carroll said that the refrain among her regulars was that City had been persistently singled out in a way other clubs were not. “The consensus is that everybody’s against us,” she said.Like Kehoe, she was serving locals before the gleaming stadium appeared and has relished her club’s evolution into one of Europe’s football superpowers after its acquisition in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour, brother of Sheikh Mohammed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.But Carroll said Friday’s judgment held ramifications that were not just sporting. The Townley can hold up to 450 people on a match day, including 100 in the beer garden, producing takings of up to £4,000 on a Champions League night.Some of those who attend the club’s European fixtures travel for hours. Dave Walker, 56, journeys from Worcestershire. He claimed that the financial fair play regulations City were found guilty of breaching were crafted to ensure that clubs like City could not gatecrash the “old order” of Europe’s most successful clubs.“It’s naked protectionism, to stop others getting to the top table. I can’t think of any other business where an owner of a company would be prevented from investing in their own commercial concern. Say Sheikh Mansour was an industrialist, would there really be a body saying: ‘You’re only allowed to invest the profits you make and nothing else’?”He agreed that enmity between Uefa and Manchester City had been building since the 2014 fine, noting that the club’s supporters already booed the Uefa Champions League anthem before kick-off“Now, it’s all-out war, there’s no velvet gloves. It’s us against Uefa and it’s all coming to a head.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84b1790609761498af2c109ed7b718ce2799d109/0_73_2590_1554/master/2590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7186b9a316010a89e2ec6f7c7e929368","title":"aberdeen v celtic scottish premiership live","story":"36 min Some lovely sleight of shoulder from Forrest, who beats Kennedy without touching the ball and then clips a dangerous ball that bounces right across the six-yard line.35 min Ntcham flicks a dangerous through pass towards Griffiths, who is beaten to the ball by McKenna.

A grinning Sajid Javid, whose position as chancellor had previously been publicly guaranteed by the prime minister, said a few warm words before introducing Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor who talked them through his plans. For those in the room with doubts about Javid’s future, his cameo reassured them that he would survive the imminent ministerial cull.Despite the smile, however, Javid himself had become less confident in his position in the days leading up to Thursday’s reshuffle. He confided in friends that he feared his special advisers were being targeted by Downing St. A week of damaging media briefings about the forthcoming budget and relations between the Treasury and No 10 had raised fresh doubts. Those doubts were well founded: by late morning, he had gone.Last night, Javid’s allies remained furious about Boris Johnson’s demand that Javid sack his advisers as part of a plan to combine the No 10 and No 11 team of special advisers, or “spads” – an inflammatory order that Javid felt compelled to refuse. However, they were clear on what was behind the surprise demand, which was presented as an afterthought by the prime minister at the end of a long and otherwise good-natured meeting with his now former chancellor.“The hierarchy of the move would be: 1, power and process, 2, policy and 3, personality,” said one Javid ally. “It was predominantly about a frustration about the sheer power of the Treasury. It’s very difficult to do something about that, short of massive Whitehall reorganisation. The one lever they had was the spad universe. It was a change of institutional power via the backdoor. It wasn’t so much a joint team as a No 10 team.”Both Javid’s friends and senior figures across Whitehall are now trying to decipher a bigger question posed by the No 10 power grab, which dominated the reshuffle: would it come to be seen as the high watermark of the influence of Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave mastermind and senior adviser to Johnson? Or was it just an early skirmish in a much more ambitious attempt to sideline officials and departments, and centralise power inside Downing St?As the reshuffle unfolded last week, Tory MPs were initially baffled by the survival of some figures. One minster was surprised and concerned to see their own secretary of state return, having concluded they would be fired – and believing their dismissal to be the right move.However, taken as a whole, Tories saw that the reshuffle clearly reflected the wider Cummings agenda. John Whittingdale, a critic of the BBC, made a surprise return as culture minister. Chris Skidmore, the respected universities and science minister, was sacked – with the science brief taken out of the job description. It is a move that could give Cummings more space to push for his pet project – the creation of a British Advanced Research Projects Agency, which he believes could create ideas and projects with “world-changing potential”. Julian Smith, who had raised concerns about a no-deal Brexit on relations in Northern Ireland, was fired.One Tory described Suella Braverman’s appointment as attorney general as a “blatant political appointment”. Braverman, like Cummings, is highly critical of what they believe is the politicisation of the judiciary, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling that Johnson’s attempt to prorogue parliament last year was unlawful. Meanwhile, Nus Ghani, a popular transport minister, was also sacked. She had been an enthusiastic supporter of Jeremy Hunt’s leadership campaign. “They want someone who will do what they’re told,” said a minister. “They’ve looked at difficult areas where they will need someone who is compliant.”For all the attempts to compare the Cummings power grab with Alastair Campbell’s dominance at the peak of New Labour, Whitehall veterans say the more telling comparison is with Ted Heath, who handed huge power to his official, William Armstrong, at the expense of the Treasury and his chancellor, Anthony Barber. Armstrong eventually had a breakdown, in the wake of the dispute with miners over the imposition of a three-day week.The frustration for Javid’s team was that while there had been early skirmishes over policy, they had not made the toughest decisions. The relationship between Javid and Johnson was strong. Javid invited just three MPs to his recent 50th birthday party. One was the prime minister, who sat on the top table. The attempt inside Downing St to talk Javid round was prolonged and genuine. First, members of Johnson’s staff attempted to change his mind, before a final one-on-one talk between prime minister and chancellor. Johnson is already said to have told senior Tories that he wants Javid back.However, in the week before the reshuffle, Javid’s team became concerned. Briefings emerged in the media, which they believe were designed to unsettle the No10 and No11 relationship – some believe stories about a possible mansion tax were planted, to be used as evidence against Javid and his team. The emergence of the idea on the front page of a newspaper last weekend baffled those working on the budget. The story didn’t seem to serve any purpose, other than to poison the well between No10 and No11, and foment distrust. In reality, insiders say that there were figures inside Downing St interested in a mansion tax, but that there were also sympathisers in the Treasury. However, Javid was already against the idea.There was also a briefing about a fallout between the prime minister’s partner Carrie Symonds and Cummings, suggesting that she was critical of his aggressive approach and argued against sacking Javid. The story cited “well-placed Treasury sources”, but Javid’s allies insist it did not come from them and they detect foul play. “It was dark arts,” said one friend.Treasury sources admit that a mistake was made in its handling of HS2, in which Javid’s backing for the project was announced before No10 had made an official decision to go ahead with the project. Other than that, there was little ammunition to throw at Javid. Indeed, when Javid asked the prime minister why his team should be dismissed, Johnson was unable to offer an argument.The big question is whether Sunak sticks to Javid’s fiscal rule, which promises to balance the books on day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament. It is this rule that has restricted No10’s hopes of ploughing money into its “levelling up” agenda. The issue of the level of spending is now the coming battle within the Tory party.“You can’t just spend, spend, spend,” said one concerned minister. “Sooner or later, the inherent contradiction of saying ‘the Labour Party spend too much’ will be pointed out if we also decide to spend too much. I think Cummings has overreached himself and there will be grave concern, privately.

As a new exhibition opens at the Barbican in London,  Luke Turner ponders what today’s increasingly fluid notions of masculinity mean for us allThe male gaze can be harshest when directed at the self. Until puberty, I was blissfully unaware of my own body, aside from the odd graze or bee sting. But then, at the age of 11 or 12, my body became a contested space. In the steaming showers after PE, I compared myself unfavourably to others, both my classmates and what I saw in the wider culture. I’m sure I wasn’t alone in finding that infamous Coca-Cola window-cleaner advert (in which a shirtless man tantalises an office full of women) to be 30 seconds of highly triggering humiliation – and a (low-calorie) modicum of sweet revenge for all the years of men doing the same to women.Yet watching the video again as I write this essay on how to explore the buffeted nature of modern masculinity against the physicality of the male body itself, I can easily recall that awkward, resentful twinge. For the past quarter-century or so, my life staring at men has been a complicated experience – a signal to arousal, yes, but also to fright and flight to self-loathing at my own physical inadequacy.During those years, looking at pictures of men who populate the Barbican’s new exhibition Masculinities: Liberation Through Photography would, like a highbrow take on that TV ad, have sent me to a terrible and negative place. The artfully posed muscular bodies, the confident eye meeting the camera’s lens, the camaraderie among queers and straights alike, the performance of group ritual – they might as well have been aliens. How did I connect with these masculine ideals of fashion and sport?The Barbican exhibition largely features images taken in the decades of gender revolution that followed the Second World War. During successive waves of feminism, women have explored different tactical approaches to redefine themselves against an oppression that stretches back beyond recorded history. Men, however, failed. We never had conversations among ourselves about this realignment, and nor did we seek to engage effectively with what was being said around us. Even gay rights activists and feminists struggled to get along. Instead, we doubled down and hoped it might all go away. The cultural thuggery of 90s laddism was business as usual, the same pernicious attitudes allowed to continue, merely disguised with a veneer of irony.After the joy of a childhood full of parental love, my teenage years coincided with that boorish decade, throughout which mainstream TV programmes from Friends to Fantasy Football were drearily conformist in their representations of gender. Struggling to understand my bisexual identity, I came up against Section 28, which the Tories used to legislate loneliness by forbidding the “promotion” of homosexuality in schools. My all-boys comprehensive was a hormonal soup I despaired at being boiled in, the hierarchy decided by playground football, prowess with girls, expensive sportswear.In the seven years I was there, I never knew of a single out gay or bisexual pupil – just hateful whispers. The deranged and lonely testosterone flood carried me to the dank caverns of local public toilets, where I was taken advantage of by a succession of grim older men. I told myself that this was just a rite of passage, unable to see myself as a victim of these predators who leered at my 14-year-old self through bulging eyes.Men frequently never seem to leave puberty – and destructive patterns become ossified into adulthood. I explored this in a memoir, which I began writing, during a period of intense personal turmoil, as a book about a forest near London. I hadn’t thought it was about masculinity, but bisexuality, bullying, recovery from abuse, depression, isolation, sexual compulsion, even how we define ourselves against or within nature, all of which have at their roots the impossible expectations of gender.I write this not because I think my situation was unique, but because I suspect it was nearly universal. Even those young men who pretend to fit in frequently don’t, but instead are pushed into denying their true complicated selves for the sake of acceptance in the wider group. When are any young men taught to be in touch with their bodies, to explore them as the sensuous manifestation of their true selves? The male mind and body are frequently in a turmoil of shame and self-denial, resulting in a mental health crisis that means suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK.Just as I don’t believe anybody is entirely straight or gay, there’s an unrecognised fluidity beyond the self-identified gender fluid. Why do we seem to have forgotten that cis-gendered masculinity is in itself a broad and beautiful, erse spectrum? As Walt Whitman put it in his heroic, erotic and at the time controversial poetic hymn to masculine and feminine personhood, Song of Myself: “I am large, I contain multitudes.” He wrote those lines in the mid-1850s, yet 170 years later, they can still feel ahead of our time.The contemporary debate around gender has hardly helped. It frequently treats masculinity as a lumpen identity, with the accusation of toxicity applied to all. As someone who has spent my life suffering from the consequences of negative maleness, through predatory abuse, biphobia, bullying, the drunken screams of “fucking poof” and that constant and overpowering sense of threat that paves the nocturnal streets of little England, this has been hard to process.I constantly see men pushed to extremes by the nature of the contemporary conversation. I am as wary of a performative wearer of a “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt as I am the disciples of the “eat steak and tidy your room” Jordan Peterson doctrine. Both have embraced the comfort of simplistic and binary positions, exactly the opposite of what we all so desperately need. There’s a contradiction in a discourse that on the one hand claims that male privilege, entitlement and the patriarchy are the most powerful forces of oppression humanity has ever created, and on the other would (understandably) like men to process this quickly, and without fuss.If having the upper hand for centuries breeds an entitlement that means men find it hard to realise that they’ve benefitted from systems of male privilege – even if they have frequently been the victims of it – then to deal with this is going to take time. This isn’t to make excuses, but to say that in a world darkened by binary thinking, collaboration and solidarity between all genders is the only thing that will get us through. “Love’s the only engine of survival,” as Leonard Cohen had it, and Leonard Cohen was usually right.Paradoxically, it was the emergence of terms such as “toxic masculinity”, and suddenly feeling myself lumped in within that unpleasant morass, that led me to explore just what my identity as a man might be. I began to unlearn my own prejudices, to suppress that lingering rush of resentment when I saw teenage lads bantering with play punches on the street, or stag-do boys dressed as bananas yelling on the tube.I started to find solidarity in unexpected places. Since my teens I have been an out bisexual man, but a closet fan of West Ham United. My own binary thinking had led me to believe that my sexuality and revulsion at groups of men in football mode was incompatible with enjoying the frequently depressing fortunes of a team once notorious for the violence of a small group of their fans.Indeed, football hooliganism seems to be one of those masculine identities where the actions of a minority toxify the wider group. Eventually, I realised I wouldn’t be subjecting myself to the endless disappointments of following West Ham if I didn’t genuinely care. I started taking this most painful of relationships more seriously. I discovered West Ham’s LGBT+ supporters organisation Pride of Irons – a hilarious, passionate, caring and erse group that encompasses gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual and trans members.At the London Stadium I stand in a communal fug of lager and Dior Sauvage singing I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles, a glorious anthem of optimism in failure, and feel euphoric as I dissolve into the 50,000 people around me to find a curious self-acceptance that for decades has eluded me.Yet I cannot be complacent in this personal victory. I’m not sure how we try to take nuance and make it universal in the current climate. Photography exhibitions in London galleries are all very well, but they can only ever speak to a minority. Instead, we cry out for the kinds of structural change that eventually will create tectonic shifts.We might look to Sweden, where fathers and mothers are given governmental and employer support to split 480 days of parental leave between them. Let’s stop talking of male role models and hope that boys might find inspiration from their elders in all genders.Perhaps the tallest order is to make the language we use less isive. I was struck by the words of Soma Ghosh, writer and editor of radical feminist magazine The Demented Goddess, when she told me of her dislike of the concept of toxic masculinity, and how it might impact her young son: “I don’t want to script, limit or resent his ‘manhood’,” she writes. “At his rural primary school, he calls out homophobia and decries Mary not speaking in his Nativity play as sexist. Would he feel so free to fight for fairness if he felt his masculinity was inevitably harmful, toxic, loathsome?”We need to accept that toxicity in male identity is not elemental and inevitable. Instead, we ought to see it as a by-product of change, a waste substance that, like the slag heaps of industrial ruin, might one day vanish.At my most optimistic, I see green shoots when all around me it feels as if men are finally starting to talk. Even in my adolescence, the boorish chuntering of laddism was a form of silence, where those of us who didn’t conform either shut up or played along. Because men struggle to communicate and often do so within strict linguistic rules and codes, they’re easily stereotyped: model railway enthusiasts as anoraks, football fans as thugs, and so on. Yet some of the most nuanced discussion on the importance of discussing mental health I’ve heard in recent months has been on West Ham fan podcasts.We’re even getting better at expressing our vulnerability when it comes to sex. I recently participated in a documentary about the huge rise in young men taking Viagra. In a community centre with a Nigerian church singing songs of praise next door, seven men discussed the expectations, fears and pressures that had led them to pop the little blue pill. There was crude humour and banter, but also a exploration of performance anxiety and the deep insecurity that so many men feel as we try to make sense of our bodies and the essential drive of our sex against the ubiquitous vortex of hardcore pornography. Complexly intertwined with the cruelty of unrealistic body image in advertising and on TV, this garish scroll of grunting is an engine of misogyny that exploits and inflames male insecurity.Only in frank honesty and acceptance will we get beyond these painful orthodoxies and myths that hold us back. If I look in the mirror and then back at those images from the Barbican exhibition, I am struck by John Coplans’s photograph Frieze No 2 – Four Panels, of a naked male body covered in a rough scrub of hair over curving belly, Martian canals in the loose skin over elbows and below buttocks. It’s an image at once sensual, affirming and familiar.I’ve recently entered middle age, when suddenly my body feels like one of those diagrams on which you mark damage when hiring a car – two weak knees that crunch when I sit, constantly needing to get up for a piss in the night, humped shoulders, nose hair, terrifying twinges, two-day hangovers. I had often felt I had missed out on being a man, yet looking at my own body, and that photograph, I finally recognise and feel a comfort in my slow ache towards the grave.“Liberation” is an appropriate title for the Barbican’s exhibition. We’ve all heard of women’s lib, but the term has never been applied to men, more in need of liberating than anyone. After all, the structures and webs of codes and expectations that hold men down are the same as manifest in the death grip of patriarchy. Liberate men, and we liberate us all.Masculinities: Liberation through Photography is at Barbican Art Gallery from 20 February to 17 May 2020 (barbican.org.uk).

Two months later, when the first video (of Karim briefly describing the elephant enclosure at the San Diego Zoo) was uploaded, a platform was launched that has gone on to change the world.As more money and more eyeballs have entered the frame, the level of competition has increased. What was once a site for hobbyists has turned into a mini-Hollywood, with huge teams of staff churning out content for demanding fans.As the website celebrates its 15-year anniversary, five of its significant early stars explain how their relationship with the site has evolved.‘I created a character a lot of girls could relate to’A friend uploaded some videos on to YouTube in 2006, and he asked me to make an account so I could support him. The site was only a year old then, and I didn’t understand the concept. I used to think it was called “U2” – I couldn’t understand why a band would have a website that hosted videos. Finally, someone spelled it out for me, so I logged in and created an account. “OlgaKay” was the password to my bank account at the time, so I used that. It was the first thing that came to mind.I was mesmerised by these people talking to the camera. I’d never seen that before. I was so inside their world. I remember thinking: I have a personality I could share, maybe I could do this. Maybe I could do it better…The problem was that back then I didn’t know how to create content. My background was in the circus. I was a juggler, somewhat familiar with live performances, but I didn’t know how to be on camera. It was a huge learning curve, trying to figure out what this whole thing was about, and building a career. I created this character of an emo girl who hated everything about her life. I played that character, then I played myself as her roommate. One character was positive, one was negative. I think a lot of young girls could relate to that.By 2014 I had 1m subscribers and was producing 23 videos a week. My main channel was scripted content, highly produced. The second channel was a daily documentary, to which I uploaded at least five videos a week, and then I had a fashion and beauty channel (three videos a week) and a gaming channel (14 videos a week). I covered all the bases and all the genres on YouTube, but I was making so many videos that I was burned out. I realised that to continue to be successful on YouTube I had to keep pumping out content. I felt like my creativity was slipping away. I pictured myself running a production company, creating more and more content, trying to stay relevant among teenagers. I thought: I don’t want to be a 40-year-old woman still making content. I didn’t want to be someone who has to wake up every morning and put makeup on to go in front of the camera.In 2016, I stepped away and took a long hiatus, during which time my audience disappeared. I wasn’t uploading regularly enough. In that time I read a lot of books. I read The Success Principles by Jack Canfield four times, which rewired my brain.I woke up one day thinking, “I am an entrepreneur, I want to create a business.” That business became Moosh Walks: knee-high socks with ears. That same year I opened a pop-up shop in Los Angeles, where I live, to see how my product performed outside my fanbase. Now we’re in 130 stores across America, and we’re on Amazon, and we’re growing. YouTube gave me this. It gave me knowledge and experience.‘My first film was 6 minutes long. It was just a rambly mess’I got on to YouTube in 2007 by procrastinating. This was when nobody was making any real money from YouTube. It hadn’t started its partnership programme. I started my own channel because I wanted to make a short film with a friend, a parody of one of the Legend of Zelda games. We never actually made it, but we made a bad trailer for it – Windows Movie Maker titles, copy- righted music. Then I set up a series called Fun Science and tried to answer questions about the world.After I launched the channel, I found other video bloggers and realised that this was a thing people were doing. The webcam I had then cost £15, and the videos were awful quality. The first video blog I made was six minutes long, which at the time was a silly length. You’d never make one that long now. It was just a rambly mess.In 2017 I moved to Canada with my girlfriend. I was ready to leave the UK. There’s that phrase: if you’re sick of London, you’re sick of life. I was honestly sick of London. I’d kind of stopped video blogging by that point, even though I had millions of subscribers. I’d already burned out once before, in 2013, and then found it hard to upload a new video every week. I realised I felt much happier not being on camera, and I felt increasingly as if I was putting on a mask and being somebody else. Viewers equated my digital presence with my real-life one. That’s one of the things I know about myself now: I find it much more creatively fulfilling to be working behind the scenes.Around the time I moved to Toronto, I began working with New Form, a production company that works with video bloggers who are interested in filmmaking. A show I made was picked up by Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Hollywood bigwig, who has no idea who I am in terms of my YouTube career. (It stars Don Cheadle, and will be out next year.)I have a few different feature scripts I’m working on, ideas for TV pilots. I’m working the filmmaker grind. I haven’t ruled out coming back to YouTube entirely, but I think if I ever do come back, I want it to be what it used to be – more of a hobby, a creative outlet. I’d have a proper job elsewhere. I definitely used to see YouTube as my proper job. I had 2m subscribers! But I guess it isn’t for me any more.‘Without YouTube I wouldn’t be making my own music’I started on YouTube 10 years ago, when I was seven. All I did back then was sing – my dream at the time was to become the next Adele – but I never really had a platform. My mum suggested doing YouTube. It was only a few years old at that point, and I was over-the-moon excited about it. I drew pictures of what I would look like on screen.I did my first video and just got hooked, and then did it again and again and again. Here we are, 350 videos later. When I filmed that first video, I was really nervous. I thought that if I wore the same outfit out in the street people would recognise me instantly, even though I had, like, three subscribers. I got more than 100 views on that first video in a week, and it just went up from there. I had my first viral video three videos later, a cover of Hallelujah. It grew and grew.It started turning serious when I was nine. We went from using an old Canon camcorder to a proper, professional camera, and we’ve upgraded again to a completely new one, though it’s still a family production. My videos go out on a Friday. On Monday I’ll pick a track, one with the most views at that moment, or a classic song everybody knows. Then we’ll get a track made – it will take me a few hours to record – and every Wednesday we film a video. That will either be a whole day or half a day. Then we’ll edit it the next day and it’s straight out for Friday. Sometimes we’ll do full production videos with dancers and all sorts. They’re big, two-day shoots.I’m not interested in being a superstar or whatever. I just like making music and content, and making people happy. But we’ve done so much. I got to perform at Wembley Arena when I was about 11. That was definitely one of my favourite moments: getting to walk out on the stage and say “Hello, Wembley!” In Germany I performed in front of 17,000 people, which was insane.YouTube’s helped me get to the point where I can write and produce my own music and release it to the public. That’s just the best feeling in the world. Without YouTube I never would have got to that point, never would have had those opportunities. Without it I’d be nothing right now. I can’t imagine a life without YouTube. It has its ups and downs, when there’s too much going on, when you’re juggling school and your digital presence, and you have to try to fit everything in. But at the end of the day it’s all moving me towards this one goal – to one day tour the world.‘It was embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online’I thought it would be easy, but I quickly learned it was a grind. You had to get your own content out, have your own ideas, develop your own personality. When I was on 2,500 subscribers I was walking through school and a kid said to me: “Aren’t you Manny from YouTube?” That shook me. It was almost embarrassing to be known for playing Fifa online, especially in sixth form. I don’t know when I realised I was popular.I dropped out of an accounting and finance course at university when I got to 60,000 subscribers. The accounting and finance skills would come in useful now, but I didn’t stay long enough – balancing uni and YouTube was difficult. Within a month of dropping out I hit 100,000 subscribers, and from there it grew rapidly – 30,000 new subscribers a month. Now I have 1.7m.At the start of every year I ask: can I do this for another 12 months? Most years, the answer is no. It’s getting tough – it’s difficult to keep up the consistency. At times I’ve stopped posting every day, and sometimes I fall out of love with it. But my videos are seen by 250,000 people a day. I’m back to my most consistent now, almost doing daily uploads. My last 50 videos have been posted in the last 57 days. It can be draining, but I’m trying to find a balance.YouTube has changed in many ways. There’s a lot of things I do now that get half the number of the views it would have got when I started. It was a lot easier to get views with less back then. Now, it’s all about the titles and the thumbnails and making sure everything’s clickable. If it’s not clickable, it won’t get the views. You don’t need to make good content to get views on YouTube these days.‘I decided to help others who were doing their own videos’I started in a small town called Knysna, in South Africa. It was 2010 and I was 16. I did it because I wanted to impress the other kids at school I thought it would be cool for them to watch videos I’d made. But it had the opposite effect – everyone thought it was lame. For two years I was that weird YouTube kid, creating weird videos about my life.In 2012, my final year of school, I’d earned enough to become a full-time YouTuber and move to London. The goal wasn’t to stay there for very long – it was just to work with other creators and build an audience. But it eventually evolved into the place I spend most of my time. Now I’ve got 7m subscribers. People watch me do challenges: bleach my hair, or live in my car. If you’d asked me when I started, I wouldn’t have thought that many people would even be using YouTube. A big channel used to have 1m subscribers. Now they have 100m.There’s always a natural insecurity when it comes to doing well in something. You ask yourself: how long can this last? So a way of protecting myself was to ersify away from just making my own content. As someone with experience on the platform, I decided to help other creators who were beginning to monetise their videos. I set up a company called Influencer with a guy called Ben Jeffries.A girl I went on a Tinder date with introduced me to Ben – so I guess you could say we were a Tinder success story. We started Influencer with the goal of providing creators with another form of income – it allows people to earn money from product mentions in their content. We have more than 7,000 creators on our platform.I also set up a talent management company called Margravine Management, with Joe Sugg, my business partner and good friend, and the Creative Investment Club, which invests in startups alongside some of the best venture capitalists in the UK. (I know a lot of creators who want to invest in startups.)I’m not the chief executive of all these companies. I find someone who can fulfil that role who is really good – and then I go into business with them. It’s similar to the early days of YouTube – you meet people and find a way to collaborate.I still consider myself as more of a creator. But in terms of how I spend my time, it’s three days a week on the business stuff, two days on YouTube. I really want to find a way to combine the two. My content hasn’t really been so much about the business side of my life. But I’d love to be able to speak more about it with my audience – and develop a new audience interested in becoming entrepreneurs or starting a company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbf83372d452e010454fd7860c0889379a04c5cf/0_343_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a4c9781f3ba9b129dedfedde25764d","title":"i look at the clock its 3am why women cant sleep","story":"While her husband snores peacefully beside her, Mariella Frostrup, like women everywhere, is wide awake – mind spinning. But why? And what can she do about it?It is 3am. I know because I’ve checked the clock three times since I crept to the loo at 1.45am. Within minutes of my return to bed I feel the delicious fog of slumber evaporate, my heart rate rises and my brain begins its relentless scan for topics to keep me engaged. Occasionally, I get a laugh out of what I dream up as a priority worry more often I’m shocked by the banality. A thank you note I failed to send a year ago the small part for a kitchen appliance I keep forgetting to order whether I booked Ocado for Friday whether Stormzy will agree to talk to me about his favourite books the shirt my son needs guilt because I didn’t call my friend with breast cancer where to go on summer holidays how to get the car to its service in Yeovil why the person I discussed documentary ideas with hasn’t replied did I book a blowdry on Tuesday? And where has that blue dress gone?I look at the clock again, it’s 3.15am and I’m getting closer to the moment when I’m going to have to medicate or resign myself to staying awake. Now adding to my copious preoccupations: what do I have to do in the morning? Can I afford to be exhausted or should I resort to the cornucopia of drugs and sleep aids crammed into my bedside drawer? While I attempt to follow the cognitive behavioural therapy advice I’ve been given and count my breaths – five in, five out – to restore my equilibrium and compartmentalise the turmoil, my husband snores deafeningly beside me.He’s deep in a contented sleep that not even the alarm clock can halt, but if he knew how close to homicide this nightly inequity takes me, he wouldn’t be so relaxed. The tedium of my thoughts is frequently alleviated by a switch to murderous intent as my addled, sleep-deprived brain imagines how easily I could slide the pillow over his face and banish his noisy presence permanently.Despite a century of emancipation, women still do most of the backstage work that keeps the show on the road. Scratch the surface of this national insomnia pandemic and you discover that inequality is at the heart of the malaise. Aside from sexual politics and headline grabbers, such as #MeToo, most women’s lives aren’t improving quantifiably, they’re just different from 50 years ago.“It’s great that men and women are equals in the workplace, but what this means in reality is that women are effectively taking on twice the load,” says Dr Elle Boag, associate professor in social psychology at Birmingham City University. “Only too often we do the work, the domestic labour and the childcare (to be fair, sometimes these chores are shared). We’ve adopted this multitasking role and it’s become normative.” So, it’s no surprise that when we go to bed we find we can’t switch off.I’m one of the lucky ones. I married a man who can cook, adores being with his kids, can put up a shelf and, if I scream loud enough, will pick his dirty clothes up from on top of the laundry basket and put them inside it. He’s also brilliant at labelling, especially now he has a little machine to do it, and all his cupboards are helpfully marked up: socks, cardigans, long-sleeve T-shirts and so on. It may not feel like it, but apparently family structure has changed. “It’s all about expectation. Within almost a generation-and-a-half, we’ve shifted from the extended family to the nuclear family,” says Russell Foster, professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University. “This means that childcare is focused on the parents, and usually the mother, meaning she’s on call all the time. This in turn leads to awful guilt about not coping, which translates to stress, and therefore sleeplessness.”This certainly explains the medley of uncompleted chores that plays on repeat through the small hours to the accompaniment of rain falling on my Calm app.There’s also scientific speculation as to why men should be so deeply and contentedly asleep while women stay awake. “The data emerging suggests women tend to be more conscientious, as well as more flexible in the workplace. Work duration extends, meaning there isn’t enough time for everything else. So, you invade the night, and sleep is the first victim,” says Foster. In other words, women are sacrificing sleep in order to get everything done.It’s not quite the portrait of “having it all” we battle-weary veterans of three waves of feminism were expecting – millions of our sex, faces illuminated by the sleep- banishing blue light of our smart phones and PCs, organising play dates, ordering groceries, answering emails and trying to maintain our social lives into the early hours.The more cynically inclined might ask, who cares? You’re going to be dead soon enough, so you’ll get to catch up on your 40 winks for all eternity. It’s a fair point except that we’re all expected to stay active until we’re well into our 70s and 80s and the downsides of lack of sleep start with exhaustion and continue down a depressing spiral of health concerns, including increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity and depression. In the light of these health dangers, getting enough sleep becomes an imperative. Foster agrees: “If you have a racing mind and continuously turn on the stress axis, elevated levels of cortisol suppress the immune system, which predisposes you to infection, and may even be responsible for higher rates of cancer. You’re throwing glucose into your circulation and changing the metabolic hormones: ghrelin, the hunger hormone, is released when you’re tired, and leptin, the satiation hormone, is reduced.”But how do we break this vicious cycle? So many of the health issues that are costing the NHS millions and debilitating the population in middle age are directly related to or influenced by the amount of sleep we get. And the gender gap is as apparent in our inability to sleep as it is in ision of childcare.“Men and women have different circadian rhythms, meaning that men are likely to go to bed later,” says Dr Neil Stanley, a sleep expert and author of How to Sleep Well. “This is evolutionary, from the times when women went to sleep with the babies and men stayed up later to ensure there was no danger. Only then would they too go to bed.”These days such “protection” of their nearest and dearest is more likely to take the form of a bottle of red wine and a couple of episodes of Fortitude. “When men do go to bed, they often disturb the lighter-sleeping women, who then struggle to go back to sleep,” adds Stanley.Although it’s tempting, I can’t lay the entire burden of a nation of insomniac women on men not picking up the slack. Another reason experts give for our lack of quality sleep is that we simply aren’t moving enough.Women’s sleep deprivation may once have been synonymous with menopause, but as Why We Can’t Sleep outlines, being wide awake while the (male) world sleeps is no longer the preserve of the 50-plus struggling with hormone deficiencies. Young working mothers are almost as afflicted as Generation Xers, suggesting that it’s societal pressure rather than biological programming that’s at the root of our nocturnal nightmares. I know I’m not unique. The hardest part of becoming a parent, in my case extremely late, has been the extending of my working day to include two jobs: one running our home and the other my paid labour.At a family get-together, I listened to one of my brothers arguing for the principle of a universal basic income, citing experiments in wealthy countries like Norway. It struck me as I listened to this impassioned, childless, metrosexual that the real “equaliser” would be something much more specific – bring back the pioneering Wages for Housework campaign of the 1970s, led by an international collective that described housework as “capitalist abuse”. The domestic burden shouldered by the majority of women has a long-term devastating impact on women’s finances.Having established some of the contributors to our insomnia, I’ve been looking for answers. So far I’ve tried CBD (quite helpful) having a bath with lavender oil (occasionally helpful) sleeping pills (very helpful, but I don’t want to be addicted) white noise (better than just the sound of my thoughts rattling around) melatonin (in small doses and taken regularly it definitely helps and it’s available on the NHS, but only for over 55s) Horlicks (just makes me thirsty) doing less work (works a treat, but hard to pay the bills) the Calm app (pleasantly distracting) and HRT (studies show it can help with sleeplessness in menopause, although it didn’t resolve the problem for me).Now, a new book, Fair Play by Eve Rodsky, sets out a plan to highlight the real cause of so much of our insomnia: the less-burdened partner sleeping next to us. Promising to press the reset button on your relationship by equally iding the domestic burden, it gets the thumbs-up from none other than Reese Witherspoon. The actor describes it as “a hands-on guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with”.With chapter titles like “Living in Your Unicorn Space”, it seemed to me a bit dubious, but the rules Rodsky asks us to enforce, starting with All Time is Created Equal, are sensible enough. More compellingly, Reese looks like she gets plenty of sleep and remembers to book her blowdry, and runs a successful company and has her own book club – and even has two children. How does she manage to have it all? There’s something to fixate on in the small hours.Meanwhile, join me in one last great revolutionary moment – where we recognise, call out and reapportion the domestic burden that’s trapping women in an unsustainable pattern of insomnia and stress.

It’s vital children are allowed to be frivolousThe dilemma My daughter is 13 and while she seems like a normal, happy teenager much of the time, she has frequent breakdowns about her future, the future of the planet, politics. It came to a head when she couldn’t stop crying and said: “I hate living. I wish I was born in a world before TV and internet, so I didn’t have to deal with all this stuff.” She went on to say: “What’s the point when we’re all going to die anyway? All we do is wake up and it’s the same thing again and again until we die.”I’ve seen no signs of self-harm and she has a trusted group of friends around her. I’ve suggested that we do something that is tangibly meaningful, like helping out at a refugee centre, but it all meets with the same response: it won’t make a difference. I talked to her about people who have made a difference – the suffragettes, Martin Luther King, Greta Thunberg – but all are met with tears of resignation. I’ve talked to her about what we can do, or are doing: being vegetarian, recycling, reducing packaging, but it doesn’t allay her angst.Holding her in my arms last night while she cried about her future, the future of the world and the planet, prompted me to write. Half of me wants to say: you’re right. Is it my fault for sharing politics with her?Mariella replies Perhaps. Maybe you need to mix it up a little bit at breakfast. Put your fears for the planet aside, switch off the Today programme, fold up the  and put on some Abba? Have some fun together. I’m not saying you two can’t get around to solving imminent planetary meltdown, but right now you need to prioritise.Your girl is a teenager, and already likely to be struggling with the sort of hormonal cataclysm you’ll be reacquainted with yourself when you hit 50. In her elevated emotional state she’s capable of getting herself worked into the same frenzy about global warming as about the injustice of missing a friend’s birthday party. That makes it hard to understand what’s really an issue and what’s being temporarily adopted as one.And don’t discount her desire for your full focus and attention. The further she progresses into her teens the more she’ll act as if she’s shrugging you off, but, conversely, she’ll actually still want you in her orbit at the same time.She clearly thinks the way to your heart is through her social conscience, which is why you might want to open some other avenues of mutual interest. One of the hardest things to work out is how to offer the love and support teenagers need while not getting on their nerves, invading their space or being plain “annoying”.My secret weapon is a simple waiting game. I just sit on my daughter’s bed – sometimes for hours on end – until she finally treats me to a titbit of what’s in her head.But you must remember, there’s normal teenage behaviour and then there’s the worrying variety. Your daughter sounds like she needs careful monitoring at the moment, and you certainly need to be on the alert for signs that her despondency runs deeper than is healthy for her. Consult a mental health professional, or your GP, or contact a charity such as YoungMinds, just to be sure she’s OK.Self-harm is just one of a long list of illnesses on the increase among young people: add depression, anxiety, insomnia, anorexia, along with staples like lethargy, listlessness and nihilism and it’s a pretty distressing picture of the world they can inhabit. And landing them with the responsibility to sort out our mistakes before they are old enough to have made a few of their own is not the answer.When I see the Bambi-like figure of Greta Thunberg on the world stage, I find myself guilty about the world they’re being fast-forwarded into. The bottom line is that world affairs can be crushing at a time when an unrequited crush on the boy next door is barely survivable. It’s certainly not the best age at which to be exposed to global woes without support. Keeping things in proportion for your daughter and expanding on the subjects the two of you talk about is essential.While sustainable behaviours can never be adopted too soon it’s also vital she’s allowed to be frivolous. The greatest gift we can give our offspring is a childhood that is not overburdened with responsibility, which means we need to act like the grown-ups. Currently, for all the reasons I’ve just outlined, our children are shouldering global issues that the smartest brains on our planet struggle with. But life is still worth living because, even in the worst of times, there is joy to be found. Try changing your morning radio station – Chris Evans brings a welcome blast of irrepressible enthusiasm to the day – and find activities with your 13-year-old that are just for fun, because when you can’t see the wood for the trees it’s pretty hard to let that sunshine in.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

The presenter was found dead on Saturday.In the now-deleted story, the Sun highlighted the card mocking the alleged assault of her boyfriend Lewis Burton in December.The “exclusive” story about the card quoted the card illustrator, Samuel Hague, who said his latest creation has been left “blank inside for your personal message” and comes with a “good quality red envelope”.When asked about the card, he said: “There’s nothing I wish to add. I’m surprised that’s the card you choose to write about. I’ve joked about far worse.”Love Island has attracted substantial press coverage for the aftercare support given to it contestants, after two people who had previously taken part in the hit ITV2 show killed themselves. The channel has insisted that these deaths happened long after the iniduals were on the show.Love Island has proved to be a financial cash cow for the broadcaster which last summer made clear it would provide substantial aftercare support to those who take part in the programme.Flack was due to host Love Island’s first winter edition, which is currently being broadcast from Cape Town in South Africa, but was replaced at the last minute by Laura Whitmore.After being charged with assault, Flack was forced to stay away from her boyfriend and had severely limited her social media output.On Saturday afternoon the Sun’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, paid tribute to Flack: “Caroline was hung out to dry by ITV. She was distraught they didn’t stand by her. And distraught about the lack of support she was given. Caroline and I were devastated to attend the funeral of our friend Mike Thalassitis last year. I cannot believe we are here again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f81c64841309c1cfe7207c157e0068c174bcf8/406_353_3267_1960/master/3267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c253b97e0a7c184a0fbf1b944b70d5f","title":"fran unsworth bbc election coverge licence fee","story":"Fran Unsworth claims row over impartiality was ‘a Brexit thing’ and frank debate is needed over broadcaster’s roleThe BBC was taken aback by leftwing attacks on its general election coverage, Fran Unsworth, the broadcaster’s head of news and current affairs, has admitted in a frank assessment of the political pressures that are undermining efforts to preserve the licence fee.Unsworth, 62, said attacks on BBC standards of impartiality from sections of the political left, as well as from rightwingers, “was a Brexit thing”. “When you get a binary referendum choice that re-frames politics, people take sides in a way that they don’t in normal times,” Unsworth said.Describing the latest government warnings about future funding of the corporation as “a serious threat”, Unsworth said: “We tend to get caught up in the maelstrom. If people don’t see their own ‘truth’ expressed, then they see it is an untruth. And social media now means that narratives can take hold that are not based in fact.”Unsworth was speaking out after the appointment last week of Oliver Dowden as secretary of state for culture and the arrival of Julian Knight as the chair of the parliamentary committee that scrutinises the BBC. Both are promising to question the broadcaster’s reliance on income from the licence fee.Criticism from those on the left who detected a rightwing prejudice in the BBC’s election coverage was a surprise, she admitted. But Unsworth rebutted claims that the attacks had been caused by a deliberate BBC attempt to avoid more conventional accusations of liberal bias inside New Broadcasting House. There had been no over-correction: “We just carried on doing what we were doing.”Unsworth said she thought renewed hostility from the new Conservative government was unlikely to win back alienated former BBC support on the left.“People are quite entrenched in their views on this, I think. We have just got to keep restating our case that we will listen to everybody, serve everybody and host everybody, but not be bullied by either side. We don’t get it right all the time, obviously, and people can be unhappy with what we do, and that is fine.”The former World Service boss, who also has a seat on the BBC board, made her case for the defence following public arguments made last week by Sir David Clementi, her chairman, and Tony Hall, the director general, who both underlined the breadth of service the BBC can offer because of its licence fee income.Unsworth said that in the run-up to the renewal of the terms of the BBC’s charter in seven years’ time, there was always bound to be a national debate, whatever the government.“But all this talk about the future of the licence fee really should start with discussion about what the BBC is for,” she said. “Once you have answered that, you can go on to how it should be funded.”Switching to a subscription payments would be unfair, Unsworth argued, because those willing to pay would end up funding a service that is still obliged to try to inform and reach the entire British public, according to its charter terms.“This is where the whole subscription model starts to come adrift. If you have a national civic function, you cannot then choose for only certain sections of the audience to pay for it,” she said.Unless the charter is radically altered in 2027, the BBC’s “universal mission” in not a consumerist one, but a key duty to keep the people informed, she argued. “Under our charter, the job is to provide impartial news without fear or favour, and not to be beholden to commercial or political interests.”The BBC’s “civil contingency” function is also in danger of being forgotten, Unsworth believes. Aside from providing news – “public purpose number one” – the broadcaster must offer guidance in case of national emergency. She had recently witnessed this working in Australia, she said, when ABC regional radio services were relied upon during the power cuts caused by dangerous bushfires.After two years in the top news job, Unsworth is now meeting criticism from inside her own organisation. High pay levels among senior staff – her salary is in the “up to £249,000” bracket – have prompted censure as 450 job cuts were announced last month across reporting teams. She and her colleagues accept this level of scrutiny, she said. “It is fair that the BBC gets more attention, because we should be better than others. It is hard, but fair enough.”Her restructured, or slimmed-down, news service will be trialled next month, Unsworth said, explaining that it is designed to stop duplication and to give BBC reporting greater impact across all its channels, websites and radio stations. It will also make required budget savings.She sees the gender pay gap scandal as “a running sore”, she added, describing it as “a legacy of yesteryear”. Journalists Samira Ahmed, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague were among those who found they were paid less than male counterparts. “We have to work through all this and put structures in place that avoid us getting into this mess again.”Julian Knight said this weekend that criminalising those who do not buy a television licence but use the BBC is out of date: “When we’re looking at a world of populism, a world in which elites are being challenged an awful lot, the idea of criminal sanctions over the licence fee sticks in a lot of people’s throats.” But Unsworth regards such attacks as a conflation of two separate debates – one about the decriminalisation of this offence, the other about the fairness of the licence fee. She cited the words of John Bache, national chair of the Magistrates Association, who earlier this month told Today programme listeners that a change “would make an insignificant difference” to levels of court congestion.Another irritation for Unsworth is the growing assumption that the BBC has lost its youth audience due to technological changes. In fact, she argues, this has not happened yet and a good percentage of young people still watch news broadcasts such as BBC One’s six o’clock bulletin, which has pulled in audiences of more than 5 million since Christmas.“We do see a slide in linear TV and radio consumption in the under 35s, it’s true,” she said. “And those behaviours will probably be extended to the under 55s eventually, which is why we really have to think hard about ways of reaching them. But it really is not a crisis.”When Hall’s replacement is selected by Clementi this summer, they must champion all these arguments, and more. Yet Unsworth still believes the BBC’s best defence will come from its listeners and viewers: “Our real value lies in audience appreciation of what we do, rather than us simply banging the drum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102f97e95a894e9c20fd11c7204123caa3463d1b/10_308_4718_2831/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf01c9c6d5fdf2a1f28b13c6413c4621","title":"james blunt review beige balladeer turns up the self deprecating charm","story":"Birmingham ArenaBlunt brings his social media wit to a Valentine’s day show in which the best moments are the most personalHaving a global smash as couple-friendly as You’re Beautiful would often cast a singer-songwriter as gooey but wearily earnest “serious artist”. But James Blunt tore up the script, using social media to reinvent himself as a troll-obliterating, self-deprecating wit. When a chap tweeted him fretting that he was “really enjoying James Blunt’s new album” (Once Upon a Mind), the 45-year-old former army captain shot back: “It’s the menopause.”This is the persona Blunt brings to concerts, which may have been a fiendish career move but seems to come naturally. He jokes that people are “weird, but lovely” to attend his gig on Valentine’s night and reveals that Elton John advised him to always play the hits. “That’s me fucked. I’d have to play You’re Beautiful 22 times.” He dedicates a song to “couples” and with comic timing introduces Goodbye My Lover, a song about a crushing breakup, performed with the intensity he wrote it.Blunt deadpans that he sings “miserable songs”, which can be true, but mostly they’re just very personal, whether eulogising a beautiful dawn (High) or ruminating on regrets (The Truth). Superstardom – and the need to fill arenas – presumably account for the more anodyne “whoah ohh”-packed Stay the Night and 5 Miles – uptempo grabs at the ColdplayEd Sheeran market.Still, there is more to Captain Blunt than oft-ridiculed beige balladeer. Postcards, played on ukulele, has hints of Cockney Rebel. Singing duo Ward Thomas’s female vocals bring Fleetwood Mac vibes to Halfway, and 1973 is rendered as a vintage Elton stomp. It’s unclear whether Wisemen’s line about “a semi by the sea” is a deliberate double-entendre, although the singer recently revealed that You’re Beautiful is about “me, stalking someone else’s girlfriend while high”. Contrarily, Monsters, Blunt’s stunningly raw farewell to his ailing father, is surely the most powerful song he’s done. Blunt dashes off – something in his eye – but isn’t going to leave on a downbeat moment. “Last time I was here I called you Nottingham,” he says with a cringe. “You were very forgiving.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Anti-peace process renegades threatened the party’s vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, and veteran policing spokesman Gerry Kelly after they supported a recent recruitment campaign for new Catholic officers.The party’s president, Mary-Lou McDonald, said they would not be deterred or intimidated by the gunmen. She added: “These people have no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer. They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people.”The event was intended to encourage more Catholics to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Senior commanders have become concerned about a slide in the proportion of Catholic officers amid the threat posed by dissident republicans who try to kill members of the security forces.The Sinn Féin president said: “Sinn Féin will not be deterred or intimidated. These groups have nothing to offer. It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”O’Neill and Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by the chief constable, Simon Byrne, as “seismic and historic”. It was the first time such a senior Sinn Féin figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh. The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have described as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack. The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries. Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in 2010 as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”. She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.She said: “Already in the executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses’ dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations and a new housebuilding programme has been announced. Additional funding has been made available for education, and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d221a23c6b0d0228b9bb72377da578729b90d1/0_111_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e01c1fdfce504a109c757b59257c015","title":"labour candidates called on to justify transphobia claims","story":"Labour leadership candidates who signed a pledge calling several organisations “trans-exclusionist hate groups” are facing demands to produce evidence for the allegation.A row over a pledge card drawn up by the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights group broke out last week after Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy, as well as deputy leadership candidates Angela Rayner and Dawn Butler, all expressed support for the charter. It calls on Labour to expel “transphobic” members, and describes campaigns including Woman’s Place UK as “trans-exclusionist hate groups”.Woman’s Place UK has now written to the leadership figures demanding to see the evidence behind the claim. The group has also written to the candidates who have not signed the pledge, asking to meet them to discuss the growing row. It said none of the candidates had yet replied.The Labour Campaign for Trans Rights pledge states that the party has “failed to act as transphobia has gained ground” within the party. It said last week it was “heartened by the solidarity” of the Labour candidates. It reiterated its view that Woman’s Place UK perpetuated discrimination against trans people. It is the latest development in a growing row within the party. Woman’s Place UK is pushing for ministers to consult more widely about changes to the Gender Recognition Act, which would allow people to legally self-identify as a man or a woman without medical approval.It rejects accusations that it is transphobic and trans-exclusionist. Its founders say it aims to “ensure that women’s voices are heard and our sex-based rights upheld”. However, critics say it is trying to limit the rights of trans people.In a letter to Lisa Nandy, Ruth Serwotka, a Woman’s Place UK founder, wrote: “I hope you understand that expulsions of women from the party on the grounds you are suggesting (and being cavalier about evidence) will provoke a huge backlash. It will be fiercely opposed by all fair-minded members, who insist on reason and evidence.“In fact, we are a women’s rights organisation committed, among other things, to upholding current sex discrimination and equality law as set out in the Equality Act (2010), including upholding protections for trans people”.Nandy’s team declined to comment.

Members of the shadow cabinet have said since the significant election defeat that they repeatedly warned the party not to back another vote on Brexit.The shadow cabinet secretary, Jon Trickett, said the policy had been a mistake while the party chair, Ian Lavery, has said Labour ended up trying to “foist” a remain position on working-class communities.Starmer said Brexit was one of several reasons for Labour’s election loss. He said: “I think we all take responsibility for that devastating election loss. People brought up the leadership of the Labour party, fairly or unfairly they brought up Brexit in different ways – what was said in the Midlands was different to what was said here in Scotland they brought up the fact that they thought the manifesto was overloaded and they didn’t believe we could deliver it all and in a number of places they brought up antisemitism.• The “red wall” was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east. The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.•\u0026nbsp Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the  and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party’s next leader. All of the 33 local authority areas voted for Brexit in 2016.• Of those who would disclose their least favourite candidate, all but two said Rebecca Long-Bailey. The other votes were for Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.• Labour leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour seats that fell to the Tories said they were backing Starmer or Nandy. They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leigh, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.“So there were a number of reasons and we need to address all of them. But we’ve also, I’m afraid, got to face up to the fact that we’ve lost four elections in a row … Brexit wasn’t the cause of four election losses for the Labour party, so an honest assessment of the nature of the task ahead is needed.”Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey are through to the final stage of the Labour leadership contest, where members are balloted on whom they want to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.The shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, who is running to be the party’s deputy leader, said the Brexit policy was at the heart of the election loss and it was clear the second referendum stance failed.He defended socialist policies in the manifestos of 2017 and 2019 and said members should be asked if a new leader wanted to remove such policies.He told Ridge that no new leader had a mandate to “ditch a single one of those socialist policies … without the express permission of Labour members”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187dc866be54a02dc4bfdb1c76a1dbf019826da3/37_0_4511_2706/master/4511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b2545dd93f639177f7af1a04985e63","title":"sinn fein election success tainted past","story":"Despite its success in the Irish elections, the party is still tainted by association with crimes committed during the TroublesO land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,Of open minds as open as a trap,Where tongues lie coiled, as under flames lie wicks,Where half of us, as in a wooden horse,Were cabin’d and confined like wily Greeks,Besieged within the siege, whispering morse.In the poem Whatever You Say, Say Nothing, Seamus Heaney immortalised the code of discretion, of the silences, winks and nods that defined the Troubles.The family of Jean McConville, a Belfast mother of 10 who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972, has spent almost five decades trying to crack the omertà. It is an ongoing struggle – and Sinn Féin’s triumph in Ireland’s general election last weekend suggests time is not on the family’s side.McConville’s name did not feature in the campaign. And Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin figure most associated with the case, stood down as a TD (MP), distancing the party from awkward questions.“Ignore the problem and it’ll go away, that’s the strategy,” said Seamus McKendry, who is married to McConville’s daughter Helen and is an outspoken campaigner on the case.Adams resigning as party leader in 2018, and now exiting the Irish parliament, helped pave the electoral breakthrough, said McKendry. “The best thing the Sinners ever did,” he said, using a nickname for Sinn Féin. “With him out of the road it was easier to vote for Mary Lou McDonald and other candidates.”Outside Ireland, Sinn Féin is best known for having been the IRA’s political wing during the Troubles, but at home it has reinvented itself as an Irish version of the Spanish party Podemos or the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic party.On the promise of cheaper housing, better healthcare and more public spending, it won a quarter of the popular vote – almost double its tally in the 2016 general election – and 37 seats in Dáil Éireann, making it a contender for power for the first time. No party gained a majority in the Dáil, so talks are under way to form a coalition. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, Ireland’s two big centrist parties, have ruled out governing with Sinn Féin, raising the spectre of stalemate and another election.When it comes to her party’s fraught legacy, McDonald, 50, a Dubliner who succeeded Adams as leader, has not been able to say nothing.During the campaign the murder of Paul Quinn, a young man beaten to death by alleged IRA members in 2007, returned to haunt the party and tripped up McDonald in a televised debate.David Cullinane, a newly elected TD, caused a row last week by shouting “Up the ’Ra”. McDonald responded by saying that she had urged party members not to make “throwaway comments”. She added: “I’m not their mammy. I don’t censor them either. We’re all adults and I do expect them to behave in an adult way.”The Troubles, in other words, are still politically troublesome. Many Sinn Féin members believe the media stirs up old ghosts to discredit the party’s redistributive economic policies. Last week Enda Fanning, a senior party official, said an RTE radio show had “denigrated” Sinn Féin representatives. “It really needs to be addressed by a new government and a proper monitoring authority with powers introduced to prevent such political bias,” he tweeted.In Northern Ireland, in contrast, Sinn Féin revisits the Troubles by backing legacy investigations into Bloody Sunday and other killings of Catholics and nationalists. Unionists accuse the party of “weaponising” the past for political gain.Supporters south of the border, meanwhile, especially young supporters, focus on the party’s solutions to homelessness, soaring rents and hospital waiting lists. They shrug off the Troubles.“When we went knocking on the doors it didn’t come up,” said Mark Ward, who was elected in the Dublin Mid-West constituency. “People have moved on. What concerned them was infrastructure, housing, health, having less money in your pocket at the end of the week.”A new generation had come of age since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, said Deaglán de Bréadún, author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn Féin. “The past is always present … but officially the IRA hasn’t been active since 1997. That’s 23 years – a lot of voters wouldn’t have been born then, or were too young at the time to remember it now.”When recalling IRA activities, Sinn Féin tended to focus on hunger strikers rather than, for instance, the bombers who tried to blow up Margaret Thatcher, said De Bréadún. As leader, McDonald has to play down the paramilitary legacy without irking the republican base, he said.“The problem is that, if she goes too far and puts too much distance between herself and the ‘struggle’, she might alienate veterans of that era. So a little bit of republican rhetoric is probably no harm at times.” He reckons she is unlikely to repeat the old IRA slogan tiocfaidh ár lá (“our day will come”), which she used to close a party conference in 2018.The family of McConville, meanwhile, wonder if or when their day will come.A former Belfast IRA commander, Brendan Hughes, claimed before his death that Adams gave the order that McConville be killed and “disappeared” over suspicion, since discredited, that she was an informer.An IRA team dragged the widow from her screaming children, shot her and buried her at a beach in county Louth, south of the border. Not wanting blame for creating 10 orphans, republicans spread a rumour McConville had abandoned her children and moved to England with a British soldier.Pressed by campaigners, the IRA admitted the murder in 1999. A dog walker stumbled across her remains in 2003. Adams has consistently denied any knowledge of the murder or being in the IRA. An attempt to link him to the murder based on the trial of Ivor Bell, an IRA commander, failed when the case collapsed last year.McKendry, McConville’s son-in-law, said he glimpsed Sinn Féin’s ascent in 2011 when he lobbied voters in Louth – in vain – to reject Adams, who was standing in the constituency. They told him they didn’t care about Adams’s past. “I found it incredibly hurtful.”McKendry shared voters’ sentiment to shake up Irish politics, but wished they had chosen another agent of change. “I can understand the younger ones, they didn’t live through the war, but people of my age coming out and voting for Sinn Féin, I despair.”The irony of Sinn Féin’s rise as the party of the future is its vexed relationship to its own past, said Patrick Radden Keefe, author of Say Nothing, a 2018 investigative book about McConville’s murder.“They’ve never been able to rebut, in a remotely credible way, testimony that the party’s long-time leader ordered one of the most notorious war crimes of the Troubles. But rather than confront that legacy head-on, I think the strategy has been to keep banging on about other issues in hopes that, with the passage of time, the McConville case will come to feel like ancient history to voters and they’ll forget. If these election results are any indication, the strategy seems to be working.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/140c55a8215f0e125387a339e5bce48065fe02d8/0_114_2888_1733/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10cb2f66ac7943bfe028e250a3716209","title":"sir menzies campbell backs britons bid to avoid extradition to us","story":"Former Lib Dem leader opposes attempt to try former boss of Autonomy on criminal chargesFormer Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has thrown his weight behind former Autonomy boss Mike Lynch in his battle to avoid extradition to the US on fraud charges.Campbell, a QC, said UK citizens are at a significant disadvantage when they attempt to fight US extradition requests, because they have to meet a different standard of proof compared with Americans whose extradition is requested by the UK.Campbell believes US prosecutors “over-egg” indictments against UK defendants so they can work towards a plea bargain, and says the costs of fighting extradition can be prohibitive as in the US “there is no legal aid system, such as we would understand”.Lynch is currently awaiting the judgment in his £3.8bn civil fraud case, relating to the acquisition of his company Autonomy by Hewlett-Packard for £8.4bn in 2011.He submitted himself for arrest earlier this month as part of the US’s attempt to extradite him to face criminal charges. If he was found guilty, he would face a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Lynch denies any wrongdoing and has been released on £10m bail.Campbell is not working for Lynch but has been a vocal critic of the US-UK extradition treaty, and has intervened several times in previous high-profile extradition cases.In 2006, he was asked to help Gary Mulgrew, one of the so-called NatWest Three. Mulgrew and two other British former NatWest bankers failed in their attempts to avoid extradition, and were later sentenced to 37 months in a US jail for a complex fraud related to the 2001 collapse of US energy giant Enron.The former lawyer believes the US request for Lynch’s extradition has come too soon, before the judgment in the Autonomy founder’s civil case is handed down. However, if the judge finds in Lynch’s favour, “it could well be a powerful argument against extradition”, said Campbell.Lynch is challenging his extradition using a “forum bar”, which allows British courts to block an extradition if they believe it is in the interests of justice for the defendant to stand trial in the UK. The legal process is expected to last until the end of the year.Campbell believes the decision made in 2012 by then home secretary Theresa May to block the extradition of computer hacker Gary McKinnon, diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, on human rights grounds, has led to the US making more extradition requests: “My clear impression is that the Americans are playing hardball on this.”Campbell believes this can also be seen in the US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat charged with killing 19-year-old motorcyclist Harry Dunn in a road collision in Northamptonshire in 2019.Campbell has campaigned for more than a decade for a change in the law, which critics say is stacked against British citizens.However, as the UK eyes a post-Brexit free trade deal with the US, he is no longer optimistic.“I don’t think we are in a position to bring about change,” he said. “United Kingdom are supplicants in any argument or any negotiation about trade and annoying the Americans might be thought to have potentially adverse consequences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

There is nothing wrong with that, but it becomes a massive problem if it comes at the expense of social homes.”The outline of the scheme was first announced during the election campaign. The Conservatives pledged that the discount would apply to about 19,000 homes by the mid-2020s. About 240,000 new homes are currently being built each year. However, a recent consultation on the programme did not contain any targets for the scheme.Charities and unions have already raised concerns that it will end up reducing the amount of more affordable types of housing. The programme will be paid for through “Section 106” agreements, which require developers to build certain types of affordable housing as part of their building plans. Building more new-build homes for sale through this method could cut the amount of affordable homes for rent.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: “First Homes will give tens of thousands of people the opportunity to buy a home in their local area with a saving of up to £100,000, turning the dial on affordability. The government has invested £9bn in affordable housing through our Affordable Homes Programme, which we are committed to renewing, and since 2010 has delivered over 464,000 new affordable homes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7acddf608fcf1c2ae6c95c0d91407b3103c5afe3/0_125_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ccadbff4377a8290bc8429342adcd7d","title":"laura muir athletics jemma reekie","story":"Laura Muir has been the undisputed queen of British middle distance for years. But after falling short in a world record attempt over 1,000m at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow she admitted a cold, hard truth: she now shares her throne with her young training partner Jemma Reekie.On a day when Mondo Duplantis broke the world pole vault record for the second time in a week, the 21-year-old Reekie again showed off her devastating kick, emerging from the pack to zoom past the former world indoor silver medalist Dawit Seyaum in the final 20 metres to win the 1500m.And Muir, 26, was clearly impressed. “I think we are very close to being on par,” she said. “Certainly Jemma has got the speed and I have got the endurance. I would probably give her the 800m and me the 3,000m and 5,000m. But at the 1500m we are very, very close. It’s really exciting at training. We’re pushing each other.”Muir had been hoping to break Maria Mutola’s 1,000m world record of 2:30.94 but she was always off the pace needed and finished in 2:33.47 – a time that still admittedly beat Adelle Tracey by more than four seconds.Meanwhile, Reekie’s victory in the 1500m early on in the day capped a remarkable fortnight in which she has shot from relative obscurity to Olympic contender.Two weeks ago at this Arena, Reekie smashed the British indoor 800m record in 1min 57.91sec – shattering her personal best by nearly four seconds and setting the fastest time indoors by a woman since 2006. Last week, for good measure, she also broke the British indoor 1500m and mile record in a race in New York.She had been hoping to break the 1500m again but in a more tactical race she showed another side to her talents by sprinting to win in 4:04:07. “There were a few points I had to get my elbows out,” admitted Reekie. “But that’s middle-distance running. I’m still learning but I’ve got a lot more to give. I was hoping I was going to beat my own British record,” she added. “But that’s OK. I’ll take the win.”But Reekie also found herself having to defend her startling improvement and responded to questions for the first time about her controversial Nike spikes. “It doesn’t happen overnight and there’s a lot of hard work,” she told the BBC. “I am 21-years-old and I am a developing athlete and I am pushing myself to the absolute limits and I will just let my legs do the talking.”Meanwhile the most surprising performance of the day was from full-time primary school teacher Jessie Knight, who set a stadium record with victory in the women’s 400m. The 25-year-old from Epsom combines a full-time job with training six days a week but showed plenty of strength to win in 51.57s – the third fastest time of the year so far.“I got a stadium record and being on that start list, on paper I should have been last,” a bemused Knight said afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ef40d6aa37d2bb12834e81850b7a015674ac7fd/0_184_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=354dde1e5b847b7d0969cf3322d54c91","title":"farrells collide england clash ireland","story":"Father and son are tied at two apiece in previous Six Nations encounters, though this is the first time Andy will be facing Owen and England as Ireland’s head coachIt has been four years since the Farrells first squared off against each other. Andy took over as Ireland’s defence coach in 2016 and ever since, whenever the Six Nations rolls around, he has had to drill his team in how to best stop England’s current captain, and playmaker, his son Owen. So far they are even-stevens, with two wins each, but this year it is a little different, that much sharper, because Andy has taken over as Ireland’s head coach. It is a game of father-son ping-pong, played out in front of a crowd of tens of thousands, a family ding-dong on live TV, a relationship, a rivalry, unlike any other in sport.And before Andy’s Ireland face Owen’s England at Twickenham next Sunday, they are not talking about it.Which figures. Because while the family dynamic seems endlessly fascinating to everyone else, the Farrells themselves are bored rigid by our questions. And besides, they have both been around the game long enough to know that there is not a lot to be gained from discussing it in public. “Honestly, I’ve not even thought about it,” said Andy after his Ireland team beat Wales in Dublin last weekend. Over in Edinburgh Owen, too, got asked. “Every time we’ve played Ireland since my dad’s been there I’ve been asked questions about that,” he said. “I can’t see this being too different.” And no, it doesn’t make any difference that his dad is head coach, whatever the rest of us think. “We’re just trying to do our job.”Well, you would need a coping mechanism, wouldn’t you? And family therapy can be awfully expensive. The Farrells came up with theirs a long time ago. They keep everything strictly compartmentalised. One could see it in 2008, when Owen made his debut for his father’s club, Saracens, in a pre-season friendly against Western Force. They were both on the bench. Andy got on first. Then he broke a bone and had to come off. He was replaced by his son. “He wasn’t bothered about my injury,” Andy said afterwards. “I couldn’t really think about anything else other than my job,” Owen explained. “I just had to get out here and do my job.”Spoken like a true pro. Which is just how Andy raised him. Owen was always around the training pitch, and the changing room, at Wigan and Saracens, watching, learning, while his father won all those matches and medals. Andy was so young when he became a father at 16 that people who know them both say they sometimes seemed as much like brothers as they did father and son.Back then they were not so bored with talking about all this, opening up about their relationship in an interview with World Rugby. “We’re very competitive, yeah,” Andy said. “He says he never lets me win but I always win anyway,” Owen chipped in. “Nah,” Andy contradicted him. “He never wins anything. Even playing tiddlywinks tomorrow I would never let him win. But I think it’s getting to that stage though now where I have to be on my toes.” Owen grinned at him: “It was at that stage five years ago”. Andy shot back: “No it was not!”They say the 44-year-old Andy is the better golfer, Owen the better table tennis player and that neither is willing to admit being worse at either. As for who is the better rugby player, there is nothing between them. If Andy has an idea of weakness in Owen’s game, do not think for a minute that he would hesitate to exploit it because, if Owen sees a weakness in how Andy would set up his team, he would do exactly the same. That is the job.There really is nothing else quite like it. There are plenty of fathers and sons who played the same sport, a few who worked together on the same teams, sometimes as players, sometimes as coaches, but there are not so many who have come up against each other.In football Noah Gunnar Solskjær made his professional debut in a friendly against his father’s team last summer, when Kristiansund played Manchester United in a friendly, and in the NFL, the Denver Broncos’ head coach Mike Shanahan used to square off against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where his son, Kyle, was as an assistant coach for the offence.But the closest parallel is in the NBA, where Doc Rivers, head coach of the LA Clippers, has to coach his team to play against his son Austin, shooting guard for the Houston Rockets. Just like the Farrells, they used to be on the same team, too, until Austin got traded. And just like the Farrells they don’t see why it’s a big deal. “What’s the difference?” Austin Rivers said. “It’s not special, man.”The Rivers have some fun with it. When the Rockets beat the Clippers 102-93 in Los Angeles last November, Doc blew up at the referees, and Austin started putting his arms together into a “T” and calling for them to hit his dad with a technical foul. They ended up sending Doc off to the stands, Austin burst out laughing, then put his hand to his ear and promised to call him later. “I knew it was coming,” Austin said. “I’ve seen that look before many times. Once he starts blinking his eyes fast, that’s when I know he’s about to level up.”It sounds as though they are one of the few families around who really understand what the Farrells are going through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12ced55283b7c1fd6d5e6e75cbf53bc20d8313dc/0_29_5406_3244/master/5406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72deba2f54561b3285256487e6c87e79","title":"south africa v england third t20 international live","story":"And here’s Tom Curran, who is on a sort of hat-trick after that exemplary ending the other night. He almost gets another batsman caught at fine leg as Bavuma plays a ramp shot that goes close to Adil Rashid at short fine leg.1st over: South Africa 11-0 (Bavuma 10, de Kock 1) Moeen starts with a long hop outside off, which Temba Bavuma cuts for four. After three better balls, Mo gets lofted for a straight four by Bavuma, who has come out dancing.It’s going to be Moeen Ali to open the bowling again for England, even though he had a poor day with the ball on Friday.SA bring back the great Dale Steyn, as expected, and also drop Jon-Jon Smuts in favour of Heinrish Klaasen. England’s only change is Malan for Denly, which surely makes them stronger. Joe Denly is ill, so Dawid Malan is finally let out of the doghouse.Eoin Morgan says he would have bowled anyway.Eoin Morgan calls wrong, so it’s Quinton de Kock’s decision and on balance he’d rather not chase again. Well, the team batting first has won every game in this series.Morning everyone and welcome to the final act of a fabulous drama. The first match in this series ended in a win for South Africa by one run. The second ended in a win for England by two runs. So today’s third and final game is obviously going to be a win for somebody by three runs. But whom?England, says our old friend Mo Mentum. England, say the bookies, more firmly than you might expect (they mostly have England at 47, South Africa 118). England, says experience – if you can come through a Super Over in a World Cup final, you can cope with anything. And yet... South Africa, says home advantage. South Africa, says youthful exuberance. South Africa, says the fact that, for three or four of England’s stars, it’s the last day of a long tour. South Africa, says the way that England, for all Eoin Morgan’s steely leadership, keep on conjuring collapses out of nowhere. Expert conclusion: it’s anybody’s guess. These two teams have met once before in a T20 international at Centurion. It was ten years ago and England lost by 84 runs, which is quite an achievement in a 20-over match. Remarkably, two of the bowlers who got battered that day by Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman are still in the team – a pair of contrasting leggies, Adil Rashid and Joe Denly. Morgan was there too, and so was Dale Steyn, now the father of the house of fast bowling. He will surely be recalled today after being rested on Friday. The forecast is for bright sunshine, so at least the series won’t be decided by Duckworth-Lewis. Play starts at 2.30pm in Pretoria, which is 12.30 in the UK. I’ll be back about 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f467a103bea7a8a6b5be7720b98c31e9fbf430/230_0_5832_3499/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc73f8041d47af2587f0ddb40b88f5a3","title":"horse marathons roman running 11 great uk adventures","story":"The euphoria of outdoor challenges – mainstream and eccentric – has proved life-changing for our fresh-air enthusiastsIt was completely accidental. Growing up in north-east London, I’d never even heard of the Three Peaks Challenge – entailing people climbing the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales within a 24-hour window. But a friend was doing it for charity and asked if I wanted to join him. Without hesitating, I said yes. I’d recently had a gun pulled on me which misfired – twice. That event helped me make a life-changing decision: to stop trying to fit in and do something that made me happy and was an adventure.I needed to raise £200, but I knew no one in my area would sponsor me – they wouldn’t have heard of it or understood it (I didn’t either), so I waited until I got paid and covered it myself.I found myself on the way to Scotland in a minibus with six others, having done no training, no preparation – my friend had given me a leaflet and told me to check out a website, but I hadn’t had time.We started with Ben Nevis – in clear weather. Going up was hard, but coming down that was really tough. I felt muscles I didn’t even know I had. Scafell Pike, in Cumbria, we did in the dark under thick cloud and mist. By the time we reached Snowdon, it was clear that only two of us would make it – we made a decision that me and another teammate would try to get to the top before our 24 hours was up.At 23 hours and 50 minutes, we made it. It was beautifully clear, with incredible views all over Wales. That was a lightbulb moment and it opened up a whole new world for me – I realised I could do anything I put my mind to.Three years later, after taking part in several marathons, I ended up signing up to trek to the North Pole – becoming the first black Briton to do so. Fast forward another 10 years, and I’ve trekked across the Sinai peninsula, kayaked Jamaica and walked the length of Britain from Dunnet Head to Lizard Point (828 miles) with my teammate Phoebe Smith (see below) to raise money for our own #WeTwo Foundation. It goes to show that once you open your mind to adventure, the possibilities are endless.Dwayne Fields, adventurer, explorer, speakerThe romance of the Man versus Horse marathon grabbed me as soon as I heard about it. Britain’s most eccentric and ruinously tough race was created 40 years ago in the town of Llanwrtyd Wells (20 miles north of Brecon), following an argument in the Neuadd Arms Hotel about whether a human could beat a horse over a long distance if the terrain was tilted (quite literally) in favour of bipeds.I began mountain running immediately, plodding up and over Belfast’s Cave Hill and around the surrounding plateau every chance I had. Training programmes are hard to keep up, but is there anything more inspiring than running through the mountains to race against horses?For me, getting into the hills almost daily was a transformative experience. I loved the solitude, the tangible hilltop targets, the fume-free air and the elevation of mood and outlook that comes from, well, elevation.I was fortunate to be living just a 10-minute jog from Cave Hill country park at the time, which helped, but I was also regularly driving to the Mourne mountains for a wilder, longer session.So even before I arrived in mid-Wales, I felt my life was much the richer as a result of the event. That gratitude, however, faded about three-quarters of the way through.The Man versus Horse is a remarkable race in a stunning Cambrian mountain setting in which competitors run up hill and down dale, through forests and along rivers. The exhilaration of being pursued by horses along bridle paths (runners get a 15-minute head start for safety reasons) is worth the trip alone. But it is also thigh-shreddingly tough, covering 22 miles with more than 1,200 metres of climbing in the (occasional) heat of midsummer. It is not to be taken lightly, and the compulsory veterinary checks at the halfway point are only for the horses.By the end, I was utterly destroyed. But I did manage to beat 36 of the 41 horses that started, and I boast about that to this day. Even more enduring than my boasting, however, is my continued passion for fell running and time spent in the hills. It’s life-enhancing, I promise you, even on two legs.Graham Little, writer and broadcaster from Northern Ireland. The next Man versus Horse marathon is on 13 JuneWater is Snowdonia’s soundtrack. Pause anywhere in the national park and you can hear or see it. As an avid mountain runner intent on chasing the trail, I initially ignored its babbling call. Then I strained my achilles tendon and triggered my metaphorical achilles heel, too.Confined to the sofa, my mood suffered. Ever the nosy journalist, I rested by researching natural highs. The more intensely you exercise, I learned, the more feel-good rewards your brain releases. But quizzing outdoor enthusiasts revealed something interesting in the subjective shadows. Intensity didn’t necessarily mean working harder. British wild swimmers, for example, raved about the “afterglow”. Did the dramatic temperature drop dial up the perceived intensity? I hobbled to a llyn (pool), leapt in and scrambled out, gasping wrong. Then a delicious rosy glow crept over me. I jumped in again.Long runs retriggered my injury, so I began combining short jogs with lake swims for a blast of both worlds. I also read Roger Deakin’s Waterlog, revered as the British wild swimmer’s bible. Inspired by his insight that mountain water courses are some of Britain’s last unwritten places, I began hunting boggy valleys for their mirrors. For motivation, I set myself the goal of swimming in 100 lakes and rivers.At first the water felt shockingly cold but, as winter crept up the mountains, I realised I had acclimatised. My body now felt thirsty for the pure invigoration of cold water.I had regained a lost human sense. Learning to breathe out and accept the cold helped in everyday life, too. We often can’t change a situation, but can change our reactions to it. Increasingly, I left my cares at the water’s edge.Water led me away from paths, as well as from my day-to-day stresses, so I had to tune into the landscape’s contours, boulders and bogs. Running mindfully, I began to notice more: to see wildflowers and hear bird calls.Cupped in mountain bowls, tucked in patches of forgotten Celtic rainforest, Snowdonia’s bodies of water often remain hidden until the last moment, then spring into view as if you’ve been granted the keys to another dimension. A hidden world has opened up to me.Sarah Stirling, a writer who has now logged 90 of Snowdonia’s lakes and rivers on Instagram: @sarah_stirlingGetting in a boat is always an adventure. But trying to carry a kayak or canoe overland is back-breaking. I had looked longingly at the intertwined land and water of north-west Scotland for years before I found the boat to make amphibious adventures possible. A good inflatable packraft can weigh as little as 1.4kg, and roll up smaller than my favourite jumper. It’s possible to walk all day, a paddle strapped to the rucksack, and forget the boat on your back. These tiny inflatables make you selkie-like. You don’t sit on them, but slip into them like clothes: an adventure you can wear.The best use of a packraft is to brush a dramatic landscape against the grain. My first long journey was from Ullapool south to Shieldaig. Between these towns are many peaks separated by long, narrow lochs. The region was once traversed west-to-east by Hebridean cattle drovers and fish traders who provided the protein for Britain’s industrialisation. But to travel north-south is to disobey the laws of geohistory, and doing so by packraft feels like finding a secret passage between the towns.After a night at the glorious Ceilidh Place hotel and bunkhouse, you leave Ullapool by sea. Scramble the rough flanks of Beinn Ghobhlach, then cross the Scoraig peninsula and the “destitution road” on to ridges so prickly it’s a struggle to believe they’re real.Next comes the descent of stupendous 1,062-metre-tall An Teallach, after which you shelter in the shadow of the mountain at the remote bothy of Shenavall. Think of the family who once lived here, cut off from roads all winter. But expect the evening to involve conversation and songs (my last was passed with a couple from Estonia and the retired proprietor of a nearby hotel). Next morning, wade the Strath na Sealga river into ever grander mountain zones.The wonder of this route is that even spectacular Fisherfield (“the great wilderness”) and Loch Maree (“queen of lochs”) are only appetisers. Leave the last peak, the 1,055-metre Liathach, to paddle Lochs Torridon and Shieldaig. Wear the boat suit well and you could glimpse otters, eagles or even a pod of dolphins. End with excellent food at Gille Brighde (Diabaig) or a night at Tigh an Eilean in Shieldaig. You’ll have earned it.David Gange, author of The Frayed Atlantic Edge: A Historian’s Journey from Shetland to the Channel (HarperCollins, £18.99, or £15.95 at  Bookshop)As kids we’re warned of the dangers of wild places. Consider the classic fairytales in which all the bad things happen to those who go off alone into the woods – coming face-to-face with devious wolves and unfriendly bears, or being offered apples laced with poison by strangers. We are conditioned to fear all that lurks “out there”. So it felt like a momentous decision 13 years ago when I chose to take my tent and sleeping bag and head into Snowdonia, alone, to wild camp (illegally, it must be said) by a small lake.My friends thought I was insane – why on earth give up the comforts of the indoors to rough it in the hills and … why alone? But I longed to really experience a place away from the distractions of small talk and to prove – above all – that I really could have an adventure close to home relying on no one but myself.I headed off to the Nantlle Ridge, the range opposite Snowdon, feeling nervous and doubtful of my ability. Suddenly the reassurance that comes from going with a friend – to double-check your navigation, be your safety net if things go wrong and provide a calming voice when you think you hear footsteps outside your tent – was gone. That’s why, after I had located a beautiful camping spot surrounded by jagged peaks and settled down for night alone, only to hear what sounded like an approaching person, I froze. Despite my pre-trip protests, all of the worst possible things people had warned me about – from axe murderers to escaped bears – were now clearly gathering outside my tent.I lay there for several minutes, summoning the courage to look outside. When I finally did, holding my breath, I saw a harmless rabbit, twitching its nose. I exhaled hard, feeling relieved and slightly silly. After that I slept well, and woke the next morning feeling like a new person. I had survived the night and strode out across the hills feeling like I could take on the world. When I got back to my car and caught sight of my sunburned, midge-bitten face in the mirror, I realised there had been a cataclysmic shift in me. The outdoors was now not a place to fear, but the key to all my future adventures – big and small. A door to a world of endless possibilities had opened.Phoebe Smith, broadcaster and author of Extreme Sleeps: Adventures of a Wild Camper (Summersdale, £8.39 at  Bookshop)I was standing on a grass-covered hilltop in Northumberland national park. A dry-stone wall stretched out beside me, rising and falling over green fields until it disappeared into the hazy horizon. It looked like the spine of a sleeping dragon, and was stunning. This is Cawfields, mid-point of the Hadrian’s Wall Path – an 84-mile trail that s northern England from Bowness-on-Solway in the west to the aptly named Wallsend in the east.Having spent the past few years exploring far-flung lands by bike and on foot, I’d made a resolution to do some adventuring closer to home. Armed with the promise of fresh air and fine chat (provided by yours truly), I convinced a friend to run the wall with me, spreading the miles as evenly as we could over four days. And, as a logical next step, we decided to run it dressed as Roman soldiers.Preparation for our journey was less than ideal. Thanks to the chaos of life, we both arrived at the start hideously unfit and recovering from an assortment of minor body niggles. But then again, you never truly feel ready to go on an adventure. You just go anyway.It was a long, hot London summer, many years ago. We had mountain bikes, but these were the days before suspension, and we were looking for a small, accessible adventure. Someone mentioned that a long section of the Ridgeway – the ancient track from the Thames valley into Wiltshire – was rideable, so we cycled to Paddington station with a map, water and sandwiches, heading for Goring in south Oxfordshire with the idea that we could cycle the 35 miles of the Ridgeway to Overton Hill, close to the Avebury stone circle, and get home for tea.It was my first foray into longer off-road rides and bikepacking. I’ve since fine-tuned things a bit, including an off-road trip through the Negev desert, but I’ve returned several times to that first ride on England’s oldest road, dotted with neolithic sites. Easily accessible by train, the ride proper starts near the golf course in Streatley, and is easily doable in a day with a stop at the Red Lion in Avebury before heading over to Swindon for the train back.The ride itself is mainly on good bridle paths shared with walkers and long-distance horse riders, best done on a dry spring day when the hedges are flowering and the bluebells are out. Later in the summer is a good time for wild flowers in the chalk grasslands that mark the western half of the route. The path can be quite rutted, which may require either care or dismounting for some sections. It’s best done on a mountain or gravel bike with chunky tyres to avoid punctures from the flints that dot the path.This route is one of the “old ways” – as Robert Macfarlane might put it – a journey through a landscape made witchy by its evidence of ancient habitation, not least Avebury circle, White Horse Hill and the nearby long barrow at Wayland’s Smithy.There is some water along the way – taps, and troughs for horses – but unless you want to ert from the route for lunch, it is probably better to bring your own along.Peter Beaumont, senior reporter for the There’s a set of sea cliffs near my childhood home in Aberdeenshire named the Bullers of Buchan. Scrambling there for the first time in my 20s made me realise I didn’t have to travel across oceans to feel amazed.I still love it. I can just go to a dicey promontory at dawn, crawl through tufts of grass, along a cliff that appears, by its end, little wider than a horse’s back. Straddling a long rock in the sky, clutching campions, I then wait for clouds of rainbow beaks to emerge all about me.Puffins are shy around people. Perhaps in our shadows they see our ancestors who dashed along high strips of rock like this, seeking out birds’ eggs for sustenance. But I’ve found that if I keep my legs still, I can flap the rest of my body about – unscrewing Thermos lids, munching on biscuits – and the puffins won’t mind. I wait and listen to the waves, the guillemots, the kittiwakes who cry like babies as they drift over the water like sea spray.The first puffin pops out by one of the burrows at my feet. Then there are dozens. They stand and watch the water. They float in the sky like helicopters. Seeing them hover in after a successful fishing trip, beaks gleaming with silver fish, I want to cheer.I’ve been scrambling here for more than a decade now. And when I think of home, I think of Bullers. How it’s changed me. How it was up there that I realised I love birds. And rocks. It was there that I realised home is not boring. There are no boring places at all.Ailsa Ross, author of The Woman Who Rode a Shark (AA Publishing, £14.99, or £12.59 at  Bookshop)I was fed up with my life back in 2011. A city-based, office-centric existence had left me feeling depressed – and in desperate need of deliverance from the mental mire I’d sunk into. So I set myself a physical challenge in the hope that exercise, fresh air and mountain scenery would bring me solace. My self-imposed mission was to climb the Wainwrights, a list of 214 Lake District peaks featured in the seven pictorial guides by Alfred Wainwright. For a novice adventurer, it seemed challenging yet achievable.Wainwright wrote that in Lakeland he discovered “a spiritual and physical satisfaction in climbing mountains – and a tranquil mind upon reaching their summits, as though I had escaped from the disappointments and unkindnesses of life and emerged above them into a new world, a better world”. I was after similar healing and, high in the fells, I found it.It took me more than three years to complete all 214 summits, travelling from my Birmingham home to the Lake District at weekends and during holidays. I loved every minute. Out walking I was happy and free. I found the process of putting one foot in front of the other therapeutic. It cleared my head and put life’s little problems into perspective.From iconic giants like Scafell Pike, Blencathra and Helvellyn, to dinky humps like Cat Bells, Latrigg and Castle Crag, walking the Wainwrights gave me an intimate interaction with the Lake District national park. I ambled sun-drenched valleys, followed dancing becks, glided over sweeping ridges and posed triumphantly on craggy summits. It was a memory-forging, happiness-inducing journey – and one that sparked a lifelong dedication to experiencing more of that “better world”. James Forrest, author of Mountain Man: 446 Mountains, Six months, One Record-Breaking Adventure (Bloomsbury, £16.99, or £14.27 at  Bookshop)My first outdoor rock climb was on Stanage Edge, the long, curled lip of gritstone that overlooks the Hope valley, high above the fringes of Sheffield. It was a route called Flying Buttress, less than 20 metres long, but every move felt precarious, thrilling. I remember the smooth slab at the beginning, how it seemed as if I was trusting my feet on nothing.Climbing teaches you to have faith in your own body and in the surface of the earth. It grounds you, even as you move into the air. Growing up on the edge of the Peak District, I’d always been in awe of climbers, but couldn’t see myself as one. I used to devour books from my bedroom, tales of Alpine daring and Himalayan adventure. Most of them were written by men. All the time, Stanage Edge sat quiet and inviting, a short drive from my house.I made baby steps: teaching myself to climb at the indoor walls in the old foundries of Sheffield, learning to drive, persuading my mum to let me borrow her car. One day, two friends offered to give me my first taste of gritstone. The afternoon we chose was hot, stifling, with a cobalt blue sky that made anything feel possible.Growing up in Limavady, close to the coast of Northern Ireland, gave me easy access to the Atlantic Ocean that generations of my family had explored before me. I learned to surf at an early age, and I have warm memories of time spent on the beach with the sound of crashing waves and the laughter of my family all around me. I caught my first wave at the age of 12 and I vividly remember the exhilarating sensation of walking on water, surrounded by the natural beauty of never-ending strands and the cliffs of Downhill towering over everything. For the first time, I really felt alive.My surfing journey was an extremely happy one, an escape from the world of human pressures, expectations and demands which gave me the ultimate feeling of peace. It only became troublesome when my teachers kept insisting that surfing was merely a hobby and not a career option. But I was determined not to sacrifice my passion for the sea, and I put all my energy into building a business around my lifestyle. I opened my own surf school at the age of 21 with the aim of offering anyone the opportunity to experience the sense of tranquillity and momentary happiness that I had become addicted to.Now I have a team of surf instructors who teach people with visual and hearing impairments, autism, Down’s syndrome as well as a number of wheelchair users. I feel very strongly that nobody should be denied the incredible experience that surfing offers.Dan Laverty runs the Long Line Surf School in LimavadyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Deer? Wolf? Moose? A faraway brown bear and cub, in fact. We watch as the maple-brown carnivores lumber straight for our group, swallowing up the space between us. Their determined pace hints at a head-on meeting. The tone of our guide, Peter Robertson, suggests all we need to do is keep quiet and sit stock-still. I can’t help but fidget.A bald eagle takes flight from a bushy pine and the sea grass trembles as two black-tail Sitka deer scamper past at a gallop. To our left runs a river, at our backs is a vast belt of ancient forest and dark mountains that hide the densest concentration of brown bears on earth. Knowing this sets my jaw a little tighter.As wildlife-watching locations go, Tongass National Forest in the panhandle of southeast Alaska is hard to beat. An unfathomable 16.7m acres of old-growth spruce, hemlock and cedar, as well as glacial fjords, rivers and valleys, it is North America’s largest forest – 20 times the size of Yosemite National Park and as big as Ireland.Some of the trees have been here for 1,000 years all of them play a hugely important role in absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – more than any other forest in America. It is also a brown bear-watching hotspot, although glossy black bear, wolf, otter, beaver and salmon swell the rivers and fjords, too. There are also mountain goats, flying squirrels, river otters, humpback whales, orcas and bald eagles. Small wonder it was one of the favourite places of renowned Scottish-American conservationist John Muir.We’ve been dropped by seaplane into the thick of the action at a remote, permit-only beach on Admiralty Island in the Alexander Archipelago — with no dock, no services and no phone reception.While the trip gives a unique insight into North America’s Amazon at its wildest, for guides such as Robertson it offers something else: salvation. “There’s nowhere else in the world like this,” he says, inhaling the earthy morning air. “It’s so precious.”It’s also under threat, with the Trump administration circling last September saw congressional attempts to undercut a 20-year-old, Clinton-era policy to wipe out protection for one of the world’s last intact temperate rainforests. The sobering proposition is to open huge swathes of the woodland to potential logging, energy and mining projects. It has already been dubbed America’s rainforest tragedy.Such a move favours the profits of logging companies over the fishing, recreation and tourism economy, despite there being well in excess of 1 million visitors each year, many of them from other parts of the United States, who come here to enjoy the wilderness and witness first hand why it is so crucial for the environment to preserve this area.Several local guides have made off-the-beaten-track brown bear viewing their speciality – Robertson’s employer, Bear Creek Outfitters, among them. Juneau, where we are staying, is a reminder of an earlier era when Gold Rush saloons were all that stood between prospectors and the vast unknown of the Klondike. Today, those same buildings host buzzing craft breweries, jewellery shops and award-winning crab shacks.Many tourists arrive and leave on a cruise ship the same day but, staying overnight, the town empties out and we don’t see a single tour group for the remainder of our stay. What we do see is real 9-5 Alaskans: charitable locals, seasonal workers and off-duty seaplane pilots. At the Hanger on the Wharf on the dock, I eat delicious steamed Bering Sea king crab legs, all crunchy exoskeleton and buttery flesh, washed down with a spruce beer from the neighbouring Alaskan Brewing Co.The overriding impression is that both the sea and forest are of paramount importance: everyone wants them safeguarded. The lack of infrastructure beyond the town also encourages more grassroots and mindful travel – you have no choice but to embrace a “leave no trace” ethos.Some 20 miles south of Juneau, the tarmac runs out and a fragmented map takes over. Beyond lies a forested landscape starved of company, abandoned by buildings and ringed by daunting mountains and heaving glaciers. Which is to say this sparsely populated, untrammelled habitat should be left to the bears.Local transport is almost exclusively by ferry or seaplane and it’s the perfect way to witness the contrasts of such a dramatic landscape. En route to Ketchikan, 300 miles to the south, we can see below us vast swathes of rainforest and subarctic plateau. The trees shrink, the top soil vanishes and a whole new world emerges. Silver threads of scarring ice have made a habitat along the mountain edges for goats and Dall sheep, while lakes and crevasses make way for glaciers where climbers and cavers chart paths into the unknown.From Ketchikan, a 25-minute seaplane flight takes us out over Misty Fjords National Park, part of the Tongass wilderness and an expanse of extraordinary fjords some 70m years in the making. Below, the backcountry looks so inaccessible it feels newborn, and we land on the Neets Bay estuary, sending a rookery of sea lions crashing into the inlet, a mass of blubber and whiskers. At the height of summer, they entice orcas into the bay on hunting frenzies.To truly bond with the Tongass, you need to get dirty and, only minutes later, we’re hiking along a muddy, mosquito-strewn path when our guide, Joshua Mendenhall, pauses and that something-is-watching-us feeling strikes again. Ahead, the wilderness has a last surprise for us. Sitting by the riverside, face on, is a hefty, black male bear gorging on a pink salmon that was only moments before swimming upstream. It’s so close that we can hear the rip of skin and crack of bones – sounds it would take a lifetime to get used to. “Why would we gamble any of this?” says Mendenhall, simply.Half an hour later, the bear disappears back into the undergrowth, full-bellied, and conversation inevitably turns to how much southeast Alaska is changing and what could happen next. The future of the Tongass National Forest remains uncertain, but there’s a compelling argument that while people are the problem, sustainable tourism is the solution. In this ancient fortress of the bear – so wild, so free and so exotic – the rewards have always been greater for those who leave only footprints behind.Rooms at the Silverbow Inn in Juneau from £88 B\u0026ampB.

He warned: “If the Franco-German tandem do not come up with a perspective for the middle classes, that will be a historic failure.”Referring to the weakness of the west, Macron admitted he was impatient, if not frustrated, to hear a German response to his call for a strategic dialogue on a more integrated Europe. Asking for a clear answer, he said the countries “have a history of waiting for answers” from each other.“What’s key in the coming years is to move much faster on issues of sovereignty on the European level,” he said.He expanded on his controversial call for Europe to open a strategic dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, saying the only way to end frozen conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, was for Europe to work with Russia. He insisted: “My position is not pro-Russian or anti-Russian, it is pro-European.”In a reference to the US and the UK, he said: “I hear the defiance of all our partners I’m not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak … is not a policy, it’s a completely inefficient system.“There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue, because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren’t able to resolve them.”Macron said that although the current policy of sanctions and counter-sanctions was not working, he did not advocate they be lifted in the context of Ukraine.He also said he doubted Russia had ended its direct and indirect interference in democratic elections, saying the best response was to defend Europe’s networks and adding: “I do not believe in miracles, but in policies.”Macron confirmed he was willing to lift French objections – he denied it was a veto – to opening EU membership talks with North Macedonia, so long as the EU agreed to the accession process becoming less theological, long-winded and bureaucratic. The bloc’s current review of its accession procedures should do away with the idea that progress to accession was not reversible, he said.Macron was speaking after two leading German politicians affirmed Germany needed to do more to respond to Macron’s offer of dialogue.The German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: “Germany is ready to get more involved, including militarily.” He called for the “construction of a European security and defence union as a strong, European pillar of Nato”.Europe needed to respond, he said, due to the sudden emergence of a geo-strategic gap to which the continent had closed it eyes.He explained: “The real gamechanger is that the era of omnipresent American global policemen is over. Everyone can see that. It is not due to US lack of military power, but to the commitment of those responsible in the White House.”Decisions on the Middle East were being taken by countries that did not share European values, he said. In Iraq, Libya, Ukraine and the Sahel, Europe “should not cede these crises to those who bring weapons and mercenaries, not peace”, he added.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, on Friday warned that Donald Trump’s “America First” strategy had shaken up the international order and fuelled insecurity in an unstable world.“We are witnessing today an increasingly destructive momentum in global politics,” Steinmeier said, adding: “Every year we are getting further and further away from our goal of creating a more peaceful world through international cooperation.“Under its current administration, the USA rejects the very concept of an international community. Every country, it believes, should look after itself and put its own interests before all others.”Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial but serves as a moral compass for Germany, said Europe needed to take more control of its own security, including through higher military spending.“Only a Europe that is able and willing to credibly protect itself, will keep the US in Nato,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567a74c89e35b1db5beb36a158fff6e20d73b4ed/0_151_4531_2718/master/4531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5189089263625653805b8620d38fa113","title":"xi critic professor this may be last piece i write words ring true","story":"Exclusive: professor who published stinging criticism of Chinese president was confined to home by guards and barred from social mediaThe Chinese professor Xu Zhangrun, who published a rare public critique of President Xi Jinping over China’s coronavirus crisis, was placed under house arrest for days, barred from social media and is now cut off from the internet, his friends have told the .Xu’s passionate attack on the government’s system of controls and censorship, Viral Alarm: When Fury Overcomes Fear, was published this month – a rare, bold expression of dissent from the liberal camp under Xi’s rule.A friend of Xu’s who spoke on Sunday on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals said police placed Xu under house arrest soon after he returned to Beijing from his lunar new year break at his home town in Anhui province.“They confined him at home under the pretext that he had to be quarantined after the trip,” the friend said. “He was in fact under de facto house arrest and his movements were restricted.”During those days, at least two people stood guard in front of his house around the clock and a car with a signal box was parked in front of his residence. Security agents also went into his house to issue warnings to him, the friend said.Those restrictions were lifted late last week, but his internet connection has been cut off since Friday, the friend added.Friends say that since publication, Xu’s account has been suspended on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, and many have been unable to get in touch with him for days. His name has been scrubbed from Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog, with only articles from official websites several years ago showing up on the country’s biggest search engine, Baidu. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered on Sunday.Phone calls to the Ministry of Public Security also went unanswered on Sunday. The staff member who answered the phone at Changping branch of Beijing Public Security Bureau said she had no knowledge of Xu.Another friend who also spoke on the condition of anonymity had managed to correspond with him through text messages but said his situation was worrying. “I fear he might be under surveillance,” said this friend. “He has not directly responded (to my queries) but just told me not to worry.”When Xu published his essay, he warned that he was likely to be punished. He said he had already been suspended from teaching and had “freedoms curtailed” over critiques published nearly a year earlier.“I can now all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments indeed, this may well even be the last piece I write,” he wrote at the end of his latest essay.Xu’s criticism of the country’s leadership came shortly before a widespread debate on freedom of speech convulsed the country. The death on 7 February of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn colleagues about the virus but was reprimanded and silenced by security forces, triggered an outpouring of grief and anger and an unusual public discussion about censorship.“Li’s death has thoroughly exposed the ills of the party’s governance and control this has a huge impact on people’s minds,” said Hong Zhenkuai, an independent historian who is currently working outside China, as a visiting scholar at Tokyo University.The mechanisms that normally constrain Chinese journalists have also eased slightly, with some of the most powerful stories about life in quarantined Wuhan and the latest news about the evolution of the outbreak coming from mainland newsrooms like that of magazine Caixin.But public anger over censorship, and the particular circumstances of a national emergency, should not be mistaken for any fundamental change within the Chinese Communist party, which has been honing its ability to control the national conversation for decades, activists and intellectuals say.In a further reminder of the government’s strict controls, two citizen journalists who were reporting from the epicentre of China’s coronavirus outbreak have vanished this week, apparently detained.The Chinese military surgeon who exposed the government’s cover-up of the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003 has been under de facto house arrest since last year, the  revealed this month. Detention came after he wrote to the top leadership asking for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials’ misdeeds.Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership.Under Xi’s crackdown on speech and academic freedoms, a number of prominent liberal intellectuals, journalists, rights lawyers and NGO workers have either been silenced, jailed or escaped abroad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb68c8a896e769e0fd15b5c79913c49d11c34cff/0_89_3427_2055/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f37b748eb485f85640aa7e77cb915477","title":"coronavirus 70 more cases on japan cruise ship as china infections pass 68000","story":"US, Canada and Hong Kong offer citizens on Diamond Princess flights home as death toll inside China reaches 1,665A further 70 people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 355, as three countries say they will fly their citizens on the ship home. It comes as China’s National Health Commission announced the death toll inside the country had risen to 1,665, with 68,500 infections.The US embassy in Japan announced on Saturday that more than 400 US nationals would be flown home from the quarantined Diamond Princess, currently docked in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo.The US embassy said in a letter to passengers that, based on the high number of confirmed coronavirus cases, passengers and crew members were considered to be “at high risk of exposure”. US charter flights are expected to arrive on Sunday.Hong Kong, which has 330 citizens on board, said it will offer nationals an evacuation flight. The Canadian government also confirmed late on Saturday that it had chartered a plane to bring it citizens who are passengers on the ship home.Canadian passengers who exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus infection will not be permitted to board the flight and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health care system to receive appropriate care, the government said.After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine, the statement added.The Diamond Princess has been stuck in Japan after a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus.The Australian embassy in Tokyo emailed citizens aboard the cruise ship to say the federal government was also examining options to assist Australians.The embassy told citizens it understood it was a “very stressful” situation for them and that Australian medical officers were working closely with Japanese authorities to support them.The British government has faced mounting pressure to evacuate its citizens, with one passenger, David Abel, who had been livestreaming from the ship, saying on Saturday that he had “given up on anybody in the UK”.Seventy new cases were confirmed on the cruise liner on Sunday according to Japan’s minister of health, labor and welfare, Katsunobu Kato, taking the number of cases on the ship over 350.“So far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 iniduals. Of those, 355 people tested positive. Of those, 73 iniduals are not showing symptoms,” Kato said.Passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, after measures were introduced to try to stop the spread of the disease onboard. The quarantine is due to end on Wednesday, though it is not clear if the emergence of new cases will prompt such restrictions to be extended.There is also growing concern over possible infections among people who disembarked from the MS Westerdam in Cambodia on Friday, after it was confirmed that one passenger, who later flew to Malaysia, tested positive for the virus.The 83-year-old woman flew from Cambodia to Malaysia with 144 others from the ship on Friday. The woman’s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia’s health ministry said.The ship’s owner, Holland America, said: “While the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation.”Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results.The ship had been turned away by five countries, despite having no reported sickness on board at the time.Around 68,500 people in mainland China are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, and 1,665 people have died from Covid-19, China’s National Health Commission said on Sunday. The figures included a further 142, in the 24-hours to midnight on Saturday, and a further 2,000 new confirmed cases.The daily total of new cases represented a drop for the third day in a row, but researchers have advised caution. The dip in reported numbers follows a spike last week when Hubei province changed the way it was counting cases of the virus. Facing criticism over Beijing’s handling of the outbreak, president Xi Jinping said in a speech reported by state media on Saturday evening that he had given instructions on fighting the disease as early as 7 January. The admission has fuelled questions over why the potential dangers of the virus were not conveyed fully to the public at an earlier date.Most reports of the disease remain concentrated in Hubei, where the outbreak began, but cases have been confirmed across Asia, Australia, the US, Europe and, mostly recently, Africa. Four deaths have occurred outside mainland China – in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.France’s health minister, Anges Buzyn, said: “We have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France.” Her comments followed the death of a 80-year-old Chinese man at a Paris hospital.Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain’s University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising.“The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn’t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,” he said.

Bearded, millennial and fond of slick suits, Bukele has captured international attention with his social media skills and a penchant for publicity stunts – even taking a selfie during his speech to the UN general assembly.Bukele, 38, a former mayor of the capital, San Salvador, won a landslide victory last year on the promise of cracking down on corruption and improving security.El Salvador has a population of just 6.45 million, but rampant gang violence, corruption and extrajudicial executions have helped push its murder rate to one comparable with a country at war.But the episode at the assembly has cast a critical spotlight on the young president, and raised fears that his public persona is cover for authoritarian tendencies.“For the first time in his career, he wasn’t the ‘cool’ president for the international community,” said Óscar Martínez, an editor with the digital newspaper El Faro.In a blistering editorial, El Faro said: “With the military takeover of the assembly, Nayib Bukele laid to rest the last doubts about his character: he is showboating, populist, anti-democratic, and authoritarian. With the cheapest tricks – vile, dangerous, and claiming he has God on his side – he turned over a dark page in the history of our young democracy.”Bukele had tried to convene a special session of the assembly so lawmakers could approve a $109m loan to pay for security equipment, including police vehicles, uniforms, surveillance equipment and a helicopter. But the deputies called for more time to study the issue.The country’s supreme court later ordered Bukele to abstain from using the military “contrary to constitutional purposes and which jeopardise the republican, democratic and representative form of government”.Analysts say Bukele purposely picked a fight with a pair of the least popular institutions in the country: the assembly and traditional political parties.Bukele won election by portraying himself as an outsider who had come to clean up the mess left by successive governments (on the left and right) in the postwar period, said Sonja Wolf, an El Salvador expert at the Cide university in Mexico.“His popularity is making him a little arrogant,” she said.Bukele has promised to end the violence, launching a program known as the “territorial control strategy” to achieve it.But analysts say the plan seems reminiscent of the iron-fisted approach employed by previous presidents.“Nobody has seen this plan,” Wolf said. “We don’t even know if a document exists, which explains what the plan is.”El Salvador has seen a sharp decline in homicide rate since Bukele took office, however, from 8.8 per day to just 3.8 per day in 2020. The sudden drop has prompted some observers to speculate if the government had copied another tack from his predecessors and opened negotiations with the powerful gangs – something Bukele denies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbeb15448a223f4e5ce28e77fa6daf83dfc03516/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd5c51b4abfb6d120b809bce2b7f9e48","title":"headteachers are told to stay calm and keep schools open","story":"Public health advisers will send out new virus guidelines this weekSchools and nurseries do not need to close or send pupils home in the event of contact with someone suspected of having the coronavirus, according to new guidelines to be issued to schools across the UK this week.In the face of confusion over what the correct response should be, Public Health England and the Department for Education are to issue headteachers and childcare providers with fresh guidance on Monday .Some schools in Brighton and Hove have told parents they can choose to keep their children off school as “authorised absences”, after five people from the area were diagnosed with the virus, also known as Covid-19.But a department spokeswoman said: “We are aware that some schools have said that parents can keep their children at home – this is not the advice. For those who are in contact with a suspected case in a childcare or educational setting, no restrictions or special control measures are required while laboratory test results for Covid-19 are awaited.“There is no need to close the setting or send other learners or staff home. Therefore, until the outcome of test results is known, there is no action that staff members need to take. People who test negative for Covid-19 will be advised inidually about their return to education.”She said it was helpful for schools to approach the virus like any other infectious disease. “Therefore, it is not advised that the whole school is notified that an inidual is undergoing testing. Rather, communications to contacts would be circulated if a case is confirmed,” she added.So far, 3,000 people have been tested for the disease in the UK and there have been nine confirmed cases.If a child is suspected of having contracted the disease, it is their parents’ responsibility to inform the school that the child is staying off in order to get tested or because the child needs to self-isolate, the spokeswoman added.The local health protection team would only inform the school directly when a child is confirmed to have the virus. “If a case is confirmed, then the local health protection team would speak to the headteacher and action would be taken from there,” she said.Schools affected by coronavirus outbreaks in their area have been given bespoke advice by the authorities.At some schools in Brighton and Hove, the majority of parents are choosing to keep their children at home, after receiving letters from headteachers warning that someone connected with their schools had been asked to undergo testing or had self-isolated due to the coronavirus. They are being told that such absences will be authorised by the school, an unusual step that the fresh guidance makes clear is not necessary.Nick Brook, the deputy general secretary of NAHT, the school leaders’ union, said: “Our best advice to school leaders is to encourage them to stay on top of the continually updated advice from the government, share it with pupils and their families, and act accordingly.“We have been signposting this advice to members. Schools will be particularly mindful to take care of the emotional needs of international students who are unable to travel home during the half-term break.”Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The advice and guidance which has been issued is sensible and proportionate. However, this is a rapidly developing situation and there may be a need for more detailed guidance if the incidence of coronavirus escalates. We are monitoring the situation closely and will respond accordingly.“School and college leaders are highly experienced in dealing with difficult and challenging situations and are best placed to make detailed decisions over specific circumstances which may arise. We would reassure the public that the safety and wellbeing of children is their number one priority.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab4e51b1ac6a21b7ef2111b1c50ebb97b6f94b0/0_1225_2762_1657/master/2762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4350d2245fd2cd652560b8c49dcd64e","title":"iraq explosions rockets strike near us embassy in baghdad","story":"Multiple blasts and circling aircraft heard near enclave where US mission is locatedMultiple rockets hit near the US embassy in Iraq’s capital early on Sunday, an American military source said, the latest in a flurry of attacks against US assets in the country.The assault sent warning sirens blaring across the diplomatic compound but it was unclear what was hit and how many rockets made impact, the US source and a western diplomat based nearby said. There were no casualties and only minor damage, a US military spokesman said.Agence France-Presse’s correspondents heard multiple strong explosions followed by aircraft circling near the green zone, the high-security enclave where the US mission is located.It was the 19th attack since October to target either the embassy or the roughly 5,200 US troops stationed alongside local forces across Iraq. The attacks are never claimed but the US has pointed the finger at Iran-backed groups within the Hashed al-Shaabi, a military network officially incorporated into Iraq’s state security forces.In late December, a rocket attack on the northern Iraqi base of K1 left one US contractor dead and unleashed a dramatic series of events. Washington responded with retaliatory strikes against a hardline Hashed faction in western Iraq, and days later an American drone strike in Baghdad killed the top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani and his right-hand man, Hashed, deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.Hashed factions have vowed revenge for the pair’s death, insisting US troops should immediately leave Iraq.Sunday’s attack came just hours after one of the Hashed’s Iran-backed factions, Harakat al-Nujaba, announced a “countdown” to ousting American forces from the country. He tweeted a photograph of what he claimed was an American military vehicle, adding: “We are closer than you think.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fb76a7c1d0eaea2c534786c1958edd529be142/2487_19_1315_789/master/1315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15a1520fa87b47161d8d7c6375e3d9c","title":"stressed heads to start brussels budget talks post brexit","story":"Presidents, prime ministers and chancellors across Europe will pack their bags later this week in preparation for a long weekend in Brussels. They won’t, however, be taking in the baroque majesty of the Grand Place or savouring the local culinary treats. Instead, they will be preparing for that most infamous of events, a “four shirter”, to use the clothes-packing gauge adopted by male diplomats to measure the length and horror of EU leaders’ summits in the Belgian capital. The thorny subject this time around? Money. And the problem? Britain.The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has left a huge €75bn (£62bn) hole in the bloc’s budget for the next seven years, 2021 to 2027. “And now we are fighting like ferrets in a sack,” said one EU diplomat with a sigh.Covering items ranging from agricultural subsidies to science programmes and the EU’s efforts to combat the climate emergency, the new multi-annual financial framework (MFF) needs to be agreed by the leaders and an increasingly unpredictable European parliament before the end of the year. Without agreement, everything risks grinding to a halt in just nine months’ time, including the flow of cohesion funds, the cash dedicated to supporting the poorest member states.Budget discussions in Brussels are always rancorous affairs. But this one is of a different order: everyone will have to pay more. No one wants to. EU capitals are bristling for a fight when they come to Brussels on Thursday for day one. Ominously for the diplomatic corps, an end date for the summit has not been fixed, but four days of talking are on the cards.Then there are the “Friends of Cohesion”. “The Friends of Corruption, you mean?” spat one EU diplomat from a Frugal state.The 15 under the FoC flag are the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Croatia, Malta, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, Portugal and Greece.The Frugals say that the commission’s €90bn in cuts to agriculture and cohesion funding are not enough. The FoC say they are being unfairly targeted and that the richer countries should cough up some more, setting up a battle between east and west.The debate is all the more toxic as the commission has proposed that cohesion funds should also, in the future, be conditional on member states respecting the rule of law. It is a red rag to the bulls in the nationalist governments of Hungary and Poland, who are already in a battle with Brussels over their judicial reforms, among other issues.Then there is France and Germany. Berlin’s main concern is that they don’t come out of it looking worse than the French. In Paris, the government just worries about how much cash is going to go to its farmers, said one senior EU official. The fragmentation of the national debates leaves it impossible to say what will happen, said a second official, with even Irish politics in turmoil following the election that has made Sinn Féin the second largest parliamentary party.Going in to the summit, the European council’s president, Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, has been engaged in furious shuttle diplomacy around the capitals.“In this negotiation, we are not expecting member states to be happy, but the degree of dissatisfaction will be key,” said a senior EU official. “No chance,” responded a Frugal diplomat. “There is not a lot to say, except we won’t pay. And as the Rolling Stones song goes, ‘Time is on my side’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"conor pope s guide on how to save hundreds on your health insurance","story":"It’s not every page in every newspaper that can save you hundreds – if not thousands – of euro. However, we are pretty confident that by the time you have finished reading our rapid-fire health insurance questions and answer special, you will be equipped to save yourselves a whole lot of money – particularly if you have been reluctant to shop around in the past.Do I really need private health insurance? If you have a heart attack, a stroke, are involved in a car accident or have to be rushed into A\u0026ampE suffering from some other ailment then health insurance is of little use. You will be taken to the nearest public hospital and treated in the public system at no – or at least at very little – cost. You may also find yourself stuck on a trolley for days even if you have been paying through the nose for your insurance policy.So if treatment is free, why should I bother with it? Many people don’t. In fact around half the population don’t have private health insurance. However, many people believe it is absolutely essential. This belief is only copperfastened by the endless stream of stories indicating our public system is not fit for purpose. The reality is that people with health insurance get access to consultants faster – even consultants working out of public hospitals if they are allowed see patients privately. They also get private and semi-private rooms in public hospitals and can avail of treatment in private hospitals which significantly reduces waiting times for many procedures – both elective and otherwise. We all know patients in the public system can be left waiting months, if not years, before they get to see consultants and people have died as a result of those delays. That is why many people believe health insurance is essential.Okay, so, I can see that it has value but it is costing me a fortune. What was that you said about saving me thousands? The plain and simple truth is if you have\u0026nbsphad the same health insurance policy for three years or longer you are wasting money. And it doesn’t really matter which company you are with, that basic rule of thumb still applies.How much am I overpaying by? That depends on many variables but the big one is the amount you are paying right now. If you have a gold-plated policy you could easily be paying thousands of euro more than you need to and you could switch to an identical – and in some cases better – policy either with your provider or with a rival and save a fortune. According to the price comparison website bonkers.ie, as many as 75 per cent of people with health insurance overpay by as much as 35 per cent a year.Can you give me that in cold hard cash terms? Around two million people have health insurance and, if we go by the bonkers.ie, figures, 1.5 million of those people are paying over the odds. If they are paying an average of just €200 more than they need to each (and many will be wasting a lot more than that), it means collectively Irish people spend more than €300 million each year than they need to.But is health insurance not very complicated? It is more complicated than it used to be for sure. There was a time when there was one health insurer in Ireland – the VHI – and it offered five plans running from A to E. Today there are hundreds of plans on the market with three key players in the space – the VHI, Laya Healthcare and Irish Life Health.Why are there so many plans? Why indeed. Insurers say they are always introducing new plans in response to consumer demand. A more cynical view has it that the companies benefit from making the sector harder to navigate for consumers. In fact,\u0026nbspon a very basic level, it could be argued that they benefit to the tune of €300 million a year because confusion and fear are the main reasons people don’t switch in search of better value more often. But that is not all. Insurance is a numbers game and the people crunching the numbers are very smart and they have put strategies in place to segment the market to allow them attract the most profitable customers and – inevitably – penalise the less profitable ones.What do you mean by less profitable? Older and sicker people.How do they do that? I thought people could not be penalised if they were older or sicker? They can’t be. So what companies do is create differential pricing for targeted groups. You will find older policies popular among older people inevitably cost more while the newer cheaper policies restrict cover for ailments likely to afflict only an older cohort. Insurance companies also offer discounts to corporate clients. Under legislation all plans have to be made available to everyone but the companies are not legally obliged to tell people about their best deals so – unsurprisingly – they don’t. Instead they roll out cheap corporate deals with confusing and off putting names, while many of the worst value options have easy to remember friendly sounding names.Okay so I should switch but what if they start asking me questions about my health when I try to make the move? Your new provider can only ask you three questions: Who are you currently insured with? What plan are you on? And how long have you been on that plan? It doesn’t matter if you’re planning to have a double hip replacement tomorrow, you can switch from insurer A to insurer B today, and insurer B becomes liable for the cost of the procedure. Pre-existing conditions are irrelevant once you already have a policy that covers the treatment.But I know VHI and I trust it. I have been insured with it for years? You are not alone. Familiarity is the VHI’s friend but it is not necessarily your friend. While loyalty is to be commended it’s not always to be recommended. If you are on what used to be Plan B or C or a version of that you are wasting money and better plans are available which cost less.But what if I switch company and it disappears like Bupa or Glohealth did? Bupa didn’t disappear. It was taken over by Quinn and then became Laya. Glo Health is now Irish Life Health. All companies are equally safe. Even if a company were to disappear overnight, all outstanding costs would be covered and you could switch to an alternative without any loss of cover.So I won’t\u0026nbsplose cover if I switch? No. If you move from one insurers to another the new company must give you full credit for time spent with other insurers and they can not penalise you for prior claims. If you are switching to an equivalent plan, then you are fully covered immediately if you upgrade your cover, then the additional benefits may not kick in for period.How can I find the best plans for me? The Health Insurance Authority website hia.ie should be the first stop. It has details of every plan on the market and a comparison tool that lets you see how your existing plan stacks up against other policies. Brokers are also worth considering. And you should ask your insurance company for information.But what should I ask them? Make sure your questions are very specific. Your calls will be recorded, so if they don’t tell you the truth it is their head on the block. A good starting point is: “Have you any plans across your entire range - including your corporate plans - which are equivalent to the plan I am on and how much do they cost?”You should also ask what cover you lose by switching. The key thing is to put the onus on them to explain everything. Do not allow them to fob you off with some line about sending you a brochure in the post for approval. Then the onus falls to you to read the brochure. If you don’t understand something or if it is even vaguely unclear, make them explain it again. And again. For as long as it takes.What is the story with excesses? Anyone who is struggling to cover the cost of their current plan needs to look at excesses. If you take on an excess on inpatient care in private hospitals and are prepared to pay a €2,000 shortfall for certain orthopaedic procedures, the cost of a policy can fall from more than €1,400 to about €800 a year. If you are in reasonably good health and can cut the cost of your cover by €600 by taking on some excesses, then you should look at that, but if you are in poor health or have a pre-existing condition, then taking on new excesses to save money is not something I would recommend.So\u0026nbspwhat kind of deals are out there? We asked health insurance expert Dermot Goode of totalhealthcover.ie for some guidance here. He pointed to the snappily named VHI corporate plan PMI 3613 at €1,349 which he said was good value. He also suggested we look at Irish Life’s Health Best Smart at €1,373 and Laya’s Connect Care 100 €1,359 per adult. For people looking for something slightly cheaper, he suggested the VHI’s Company Plan Plus Level 1.3 at €1,162 per adult or Irish Life Health 4D Health 2 at €1,273 per adult or Laya’s Simply Connect which is €1,180 per adultGoode says that how you engage with the insurers will determine whether you will get the best deal or not: “Always do your research first so that when you phone them, you’re asking for a specific plan or plans by name. Never ask them ‘what do you recommend”.He advises people to “always check the following hospital coverage excesses MRI scan centres near where you live disclose any existing conditions or pending treatment consultant coverage and upgrade rules. If you’re happy that the new plan meets your requirements, then switch”.Anything else? One very important thing. If you do switch, make sure you cancel the old policy once the new cover is in place. Paying for one policy is expensive, you don’t want to find yourself paying for two!Goode tips to cut the cost of health insuranceWe asked Dermot Goode for his top tips to save money.1. Check out a quality corporate plan, i.e. one which covers public and private hospitals with guaranteed refunds on your out-patient expenses with no excess to pay first. Remember you can join any plan irrespective of the plan name.2. Take on a small excess which could reduce your costs by anything from €500 – €1,000 depending on the plan held. These excess are mostly per claim, not per night and they only apply to private hospital admissions3. Split your cover, i.e. you can place each person on a different plan relative to their needs but all still remaining on the one overall policy. You can even split your cover across different insurers if needs be to maximise your savings.4. Check out those discounted offers for child cover, e.g. VHI are offering 50 per cent discounts on the cost of child cover on 14 different plans - check out their One Plan Complete at €168 per child. Laya are offering free cover on the second and subsequent child on their Essential Connect Family which is a saving of approx. €240 per child. Irish Life Health are offering a discounted rate of €180 per child on their Nurture and Select Plus schemes. Splitting cover makes perfect sense here, e.g. put the adults on a good corporate plan and place the children on one of these discounted plans5. If you have young adults on your plan (aged 18-25), make sure that you are getting young adult rates. Some insurers charge the full adult rate on certain plans but if you moved this young adult to a different scheme with “young adult rates”, you could save anything from 10 per cent to 45 per cent depending on their age and the plan selected."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4175424.1581849931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greens to invite other parties to discuss key issues for next government","story":"The Green Party is seeking to hold talks with other political parties on how a new government could deliver on the issues of housing, healthcare and combating climate change. It said Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Social Democrats would be invited to bilateral meetings between February 21st and February 29th to discuss the policy areas in an attempt to get clarity on “points of agreement and difference with each party”. “There is broad agreement among a variety of parties that any new government has to deliver on housing, health care and climate action but no discussion yet on how these changes should be made,” Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said in a statement on Sunday.“We are doing what we said on the election campaign, talking to each party equally, respecting their mandate but insisting that any new government has to be fully clear on how we meet the big challenges we face.”The Green Party won 12 seats in last week’s general election, which saw no party have more than 38 TDs elected, and it has been regularly mentioned as a potential part of a coalition government. Reports on Sunday suggest Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are to enter talks in the coming days on forming a grand coalition, which would need the support of a third party such as the Greens to have a majority in the Dáil. OppositionHowever, some in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are opposed to the old rivals pairing up and would favour a period in opposition given both lost seats in the election which followed the conclusion of a confidence-and-supply arrangement between the two during the last Dáil. Sinn Féin seized the early post-election initiative, after winning an additional 14 seats and the largest share of the vote, by reaching out to other groups in an attempt to form a left-leaning government. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her preference would be to form a government without Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but her housing spokesman, Eoin Ó Broin, said late last week such an arrangement would not be workable. Ms McDonald on Saturday accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of arrogance for saying he would not enter coalition with her party due to concerns about Sinn Féin’s approach to the economy and its democratic credentials. In his statement on Sunday, Mr Ryan said the Greens would be asking the other parties six main questions: How do we meet our climate and bioersity targets? How do we address the housing crisis? What are the immediate priorities in implementing Slaintecare? How do we fund the necessary increase in public services? What are the all-island, Brexit, and European dimensions to the changes we seek? How do we support better community development as we improve public services?“Invitations will be sent to other parties on Monday and we will engage with them in advance of each meeting to agree on the terms of reference and approach for each event,” the Green Party said.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin of “arrogance” after he again ruled out entering a coalition government with her party. In her first speech in Northern Ireland since last weekend’s general election, Ms McDonald told Sinn Féin’s Six County AGM that “the people voted for change”.The election saw Sinn Féin win the largest share of the vote (24.5 per cent) and its candidates secured 37 Dáil seats, one fewer than Fianna Fáil’s total. “Sinn Féin won the election,” Ms McDonald told supporters on Saturday at the Balmoral Hotel in Belfast. Ahead of the speech it was made clear by Sinn Féin’s press department there would be no opportunity for the media to ask questions at the event. Mr Martin and Ms McDonald spoke by telephone on Friday, and he congratulated the Sinn Féin leader on her electoral success before outlining the reasons why his party will not go into coalition with her party.He said Fianna Fáil had a mandate and it was its prerogative and duty to try to form a government. He argued no grouping in the Dáil could force another grouping to form a government when there were such incompatible views on economic policy and other issues.In her speech on Saturday, Ms McDonald said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were “determined to keep us out of government” and that Mr Martin planned to “deny the people what they voted for”.“That is an arrogant and untenable position, given the strength of Sinn Féin’s mandate,” she said. Matt Carthy, the former MEP who topped the poll in Cavan-Monaghan in last week’s election, opened proceedings by attributing the party’s recent success to Ms McDonald.He said Sinn Féin “is in government in the North” and is ready to do likewise in the State. Standing in front of a banner stating ‘Time for Unity’, Ms McDonald said: “Never again will a general election be pitched as a simple choice between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.“Just as the unionist majority here in the North has gone, the two-party system has been consigned to history”.All-Ireland partyMs McDonald said her candidates had been elected in record numbers on a “people’s manifesto” and noted all 32 counties on the island of Ireland now had a Sinn Féin representative. She claimed Sinn Féin is “the only all-Ireland party resolutely committed to Irish unity”.She attacked the republican credentials of Fianna Fáil, which does not stand for election in Northern Ireland but does have a loose relationship with the SDLP, which only stands for election in the North. “Fine Gael postures as the ‘United Ireland party’ but has no strategy, no programme and no real desire to bring unity about,” she said. “And as for Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, Irish unity doesn’t rate a mention in its manifesto’s five core aims.”She accused both of having “no plan, just waffle”.“They cannot block the growing demand around unity,” she added. Ms McDonald also criticised “so-called dissidents” for making threats against Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Sinn Féin’s policing spokesman, Gerry Kelly MLA , for attending a PSNI recruitment event in Belfast. She said those engaged in such threats had “no politics, no strategy and nothing to offer”.“They are at war with their community and are now threatening political representatives who serve the people,” she said.StormontThe section of the speech on the restoration of Stormont gained applause from the audience.Ms McDonald highlighted the need for action on matters in Northern Ireland such as poverty, health, housing and victims’ issues, and stressed “unionists have nothing to fear from Irish unity”.“Of course many of them may see that differently,” she added. “But the answer to that is to talk.”Ms McDonald urged Sinn Féin activists to “keep your shoulder to the wheel” and serve local communities. She ended the speech by saying: “Onwards. Upwards. We can do this. We will do this. We are almost there. And now we will leave and work hard in our communities as proud republicans, as unapologetic united Irelanders.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

As a UK government, we will not be having a border down the Irish Sea.”Mr Lewis was appointed secretary of state on Thursday after the previous incumbent, Julian Smith, was sacked by the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson.He told reporters he was “very fortunate to be coming in as secretary of state off the back of somebody who did a great job and actually delivered, as I say, that agreement”.Mr Smith, he said, had been “a superb secretary of state. I’ve got tough boots to fill and the exciting job of delivering on that agreement.”Mr Lewis visited Queen’s University’s Centre for Security Information Technologies (CSIT) in the Northern Ireland Science Park in Belfast on Friday afternoon, in what was his first trip to the North in his new role.During his first day in office he also spoke by telephone to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, as well as the North’s first and deputy first ministers, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill, as well as to the Chief Constable Simon Byrne.‘Vexatious prosecutions’Mr Coveney said on social media he and Mr Lewis had had “a very positive first call” and he was “looking forward” to working with him “for as long I hold my role in government”.Ms O’Neill said following her conversation with Mr Lewis they agreed to meet “as a matter of urgency” to discuss “important matters including his government’s approach to the legacy of the conflict, particularly in relation to the bad faith shown over the issue of pensions for those injured as a result of the conflict”.Mr Johnson has pledged to end what he describes as “vexatious prosecutions” against former servicemen.Ms O’Neill also said she intended to challenge Mr Lewis on the financial commitments made by the British government in the New Decade, New Approach deal and on Brexit.Meanwhile, Ms Foster told the BBC that Mr Lewis “has to be an advocate for the union and I very much hope that he is”.Regulatory checksMr Lewis is a former chairman of the Conservative Party and has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.Both he and Mr Johnson have previously said there will be no customs or regulatory checks on the Irish Sea as a result of Brexit.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said during a recent speech in Belfast that there would be regulatory checks at Northern Ireland’s ports and airports for goods arriving from Great Britain.Asked to clarify this, Mr Lewis replied: “We’ve always said the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to be one area and all will be able to benefit from our future global trade deals.“I appreciate what Michel Barnier says, he’s a very good man trying to do a good job for the EU, but this is also the man who said we couldn’t open the withdrawal agreement. And our prime minister got that agreement opened, got a new agreement, got it through parliament and we’ve left the European Union and we’re going to build a future beneficial economy for the whole of the United Kingdom as one,” he said.

That’s a fairly rapid u-turn, given that the global campaign was only launched last year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesPerhaps BP has realised the futility of spending large sums highlighting the tiny part of its business that generates renewable energy when the company remains synonymous with fossil fuels.\u0026nbspAdverts on billboards, newspapers and television in the UK, US and Europe as well as on social media and online\u0026nbsppictured\u0026nbspgreen fields and windmills alongside phrases like, “working to make energy cleaner”. The ads missed out the fact that\u0026nbsp96 per cent of BP’s capital expenditure is on oil and gas.Thanks in part to the efforts of groups like environmental lawyers ClientEarth which launched a complaint against over the campaign, the company has been held to account.Two decades – and billions of barrels of oil – since BP had the chutzpah to relaunch itself as “beyond petroleum”, people have seen through the facade.“In future, any corporate advertising will be to push for progressive climate policy communicate our net zero ambition invite ideas or build collaboration,” BP said.This statement, unlike the target to go carbon neutral by 2050, can be scrutinised immediately and it will be. I will be closely watching BP’s public statements on climate change this year, as well as its advertising and involvement with groups like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, to check that they measure up.We can all play a part in this too. Earlier this month Ryanair was banned from claiming that it was Europe’s “lowest CO2 emissions airline”. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the statement couldn’t be backed up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BP sets target to achieve net zero by 2050 to tackle climate emergencyThe climate crisis is real, but Boris Johnson still ‘doesn’t get it’Boris Johnson forces out UK president of climate change summitAnyone can make a complaint to the ASA about an issue like an misleading environmental claim, it just requires filling out a few boxes on an online form.If this action does not stop airlines and oil companies producing dodgy ads on climate change, sterner laws must be enforced. ClientEarth’s suggestion that fossil fuel adverts should be banned unless they have a tobacco-style health warning need to be\u0026nbspconsidered.A fossil fuel company portraying itself as good for the climate is no less ridiculous, or dangerous, than the tobacco companies that in the 1950s pushed cigarettes with recommendations from friendly-looking doctors.Companies that create misleading adverts about climate change need to face the prospect of fines, not just damage to their\u0026nbspreputation. Currently the ASA, is self-funded by advertisers themselves and can only ban particular promotions, often months after they’ve\u0026nbspgone out.While advertising is an important way that large greenhouse gas emitters can use their financial clout to shift the debate in their favour, a more significant front on the climate change\u0026nbspinformation war\u0026nbspis political lobbying.Here too, BP has laid down a marker by which it can be judged not in 10 years or 20 years, but almost immediately.\u0026nbspThe company laid out a less aggressive approach to lobbying, stating that it would “set new expectations” for its relationships with oil industry trade associations. Where those influential groups are pushing for policies that don’t align with BP’s new approach, it will leave.Created with Sketch.Youth Strike for Climate: London protest in photos Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Basically, this is an admission that BP’s net-zero ambition simply has no credibility if the company remains a member of powerful lobby groups like the American Petroleum Institute which has for decades funded climate change denial in a successful effort to cast doubt on the scientific consensus. BP either has to fundamentally change the API or leave it.The impact of a big oil industry player changing tack could be considerable but action needs to follow words. I’ll also be scrutinising other large oil industry firms about whether they will follow BP in “advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing”.Fossil fuel lobbyists have vast budgets that allow\u0026nbspthem\u0026nbspto shift public policy and discussion significantly towards the industry’s own interests over and above those of everyone else.In any case, oil companies\u0026nbsplike formerly state-owned BP have frequently been pushing on open doors in the corridors of power. Seen by\u0026nbsppoliticians\u0026nbspto be of strategic national importance, oil majors have provided\u0026nbspthe vital commodity that fuels economic growth and\u0026nbspdelivers votes.It’s fair to say the oil majors have frequently enjoyed a cosy relationship with governments sympathetic to their aims.\u0026nbspVast budgets to fund misinformation and dodgy science have been key to prolonging the life of fossil fuel industry decades after oil companies knew climate change was dangerous and man-made.\u0026nbspClimate campaigners, who have enjoyed less privileged access to political decision-makers, have therefore been fighting a hugely asymmetric battle but one which they may now finally be starting to win.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies. They are some of FTSE 100\u0027s biggest and most important constituents.\u0026nbspEthical investment isn’t always ethical – here’s what to considerCan cutting investment force firms to go green?World’s largest fund manager to sell coal investments You have oil giants (BP, Shell), you have mining companies (Anglo American, BHP Group, Rio Tinto).\u0026nbspA person who saves via a FTSE 100 or FTSE All Share tracker is hitching their wagon to the performance of all of these companies. So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be anything from sniffing hints of chemicals on alien worlds to indications that there could be structures or lasers on other planets.Dr Tony Beasley, director of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) telescope based in Virginia, US, said: Determining whether we are alone in the universe as technologically capable life is among the most compelling questions in science.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Scientists hope that citizen scientists will be able to find interesting things in the data – whether that is unknown natural phenomena, or something even more unexpected, such as alien life.“Since Breakthrough Listen’s initial data release last year, we have doubled what is available to the public,” said Breakthrough Listen’s lead system administrator, Matt Lebofsky. “It is our hope that these data sets will reveal something new and interesting, be it other intelligent life in the universe or an as-yet-undiscovered natural astronomical phenomenon.”Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and founder of the Breakthrough initiative, said: For the whole of human history, we had a limited amount of data to search for life beyond Earth.So, all we could do was speculate.Now, as we are getting a lot of data, we can do real science and, with making this data available to general public, so can anyone who wants to know the answer to this deep question.The initiatives and strategies in expanding the search for extraterrestrial life were presented at the the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Seattle.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will be given the option of looking at their normal feed or clicking through to the latest posts, which will show in chronological order.Instagram changed the order of the feed in early 2016, almost exactly four years ago, but many of the app\u0027s users still regularly ask for it to come back.Instagram update tells users who they don’t likeIn the time since, the company has had to fight against claims that it leads to almost all posts being missed, and has made some concessions to users by changing the way the algorithm chooses which posts are chosen to be shown.Despite all of that, the company has repeatedly insisted that the chronological feed will not be returning. The new update appears to be some concession for the demands for posts to appear in time order, without entirely reversing the switch to using an algorithm.Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment and further information on the potential feature.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s also entirely ultrared, or highly reflective, which is commonplace in the faraway Twilight Zone of our solar system known as the the Kuiper Belt.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The reddish color is indicative of organic molecules.While frozen methane is present, no water has yet been found on the body, which is an estimated 22 miles (36 kilometers) long tip to tip. At a news conference Thursday in Seattle, New Horizons\u0027 chief scientist Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute said its size was roughly that of the city.As for the snowman shape, it\u0027s not nearly as flat on the backside as previously thought. Neither the small nor big sphere is fully round, but far from the flatter pancake shape scientists reported a year ago. The research team likened the somewhat flattened spherical forms to the shape of M\u0026ampMs.No rings or satellites have been found. The light cratering suggests Arrokoth dates back to the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. It likely was created by a slow, gentle merger between two separate objects that possibly were an orbiting pair. The resulting fused body is considered a contact binary.This kind of slow-motion hookup likely arose from collapsing clouds in the solar nebula, as opposed to intense collisions theorized to form these planetesimals, or little orbiting bodies.New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, more than three years after the spacecraft visited Pluto. Originally nicknamed Ultima Thule, the object received its official name in November Arrokoth means sky in the language of the Native American Powhatan people.Launched in 2006, the spacecraft is now 316 million miles (509 million kilometers) beyond Arrokoth. The research team is looking for other potential targets to investigate. Powerful ground telescopes still under construction will help survey this part of the sky.Emerging technology will enable scientists to develop a mission that could put a spacecraft in orbit around Pluto, 3 billion miles (5 billion kilometers) away, according to Stern. After a few years, that same spacecraft could be sent even deeper into the Kuiper Belt to check out other dwarf planets and objects, he said.The New Horizons scientists reported their latest findings at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as well as in three separate papers in the journal Science.David Jewitt of the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the studies, said a flyby mission like New Horizons, where encounters last just a few days, is hardly ideal.For future missions, we need to be able to send spacecraft to the Kuiper Belt and keep them there in orbit around objects, Jewitt wrote in a companion piece in Science. That would allow these intriguing bodies to be studied in stunning geological and geophysical detail, he noted.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS\u0026nbspwas found to have mis-sold complex financial products to small-business customers in a bid to boost its own bottom line, while its infamous Global Restructuring\u0026nbspGroup destroyed firms to sell off their assets for a profit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Davies\u0026nbspsaid: “The essential reason for this is, as the bank has evolved from the financial crisis and the bailout, we have focused on the NatWest brand.“We have exited a lot of the international businesses which were not profitable. That was branded RBS and that’s gone.“It really makes no sense for us to continue to be called\u0026nbspRBS.

Free health care? A jobs guarantee? Isn’t that socialism?Cardi B and Mark Ruffalo among celebrities backing Bernie SandersWhy the rise of Bernie Sanders is making some Democrats nervousWill bitter moderates vote for Bernie Sanders?But while policies such as free universal healthcare are seen as extreme in the US they are perfectly ordinary in Europe.The higher tax and spending proposed by Sanders would also not be out of place on the other side of the Atlantic.The economist Paul Krugman says Sanders is better described as a European-style social democrat rather than a socialist, not least because Sanders isn’t proposing to nationalise private industries.OK, but would this ruin the American economy?The French economist Thomas Piketty even argues Sanders’\u0026nbsppolicies could be beneficial to the US economy\u0026nbspby raising the country’s growth rate, and says that his wealth distribution policies tap into an older tradition of American policymaking.“Remember that the US is actually the country that invented progressive taxation of income and wealth in the 20th century,” Piketty points out.Others have described Sanders as a “New Dealer”, referring to the progressive economic policies put in place by former\u0026nbspDemocratic President Franklin Roosevelt in the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s.So why are people describing Sanders as dangerous?But it may also be that the genuinely fear Sanders’ policies, even if they are in the mainstream of the European tradition, will do damage in the US context.Or they may be assuming that Sanders, if he won power, would pursue policies that go much further than those he has proposed, with the 78-year-old proving more radical in office, perhaps like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.Against this, though, is the institutional fact that US presidents are constrained by Congress in what policies they can enact. Sanders might be in favour of relatively radical redistribution, but that’s not true of the wider Democratic party.Even some of Sanders’ rivals for the Democratic nomination, such as Pete Buttigieg, are critical of his policies such as the $15 federal minimum wage.That’s why many analysts – even those who support the principle of “medicare-for-all” – think there is little chance he could actually deliver it, even if he won power.And while some financiers are sounding the alarm, others are more sanguine.Another Wall Street Bank, JPMorgan, recently told its clients that, even if Sanders were elected, “we put the probability of major changes like medicare-for-all or a wealth tax at less than 5 percent.”All of which raises a question: is the risk less that Sanders ruins the US economy than that he disappoints his supporters?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But why The war between Blair and Brown blighted Labour’s years in office and held back progress.Even Theresa May’s dismal tenure was worsened by Philip Hammond’s soul-sapping negativity.The friendship of David Cameron and George Osborne, by contrast, succeeded in restoring sanity to our finances.So Boris Johnson knows he must have the Treasury fully onside.He and chief adviser Dominic Cummings need it to enact their ideas, not resist or dilute them.It is clear Sajid Javid’s advisers were considered just such an obstacle.The Sun has a lot of time for The Saj, a decent bloke who commendably stood by his staff.His is a sad departure.He might have proved a fine Chancellor.But Rishi Sunak should too.He is very bright, imaginative and enthused by our post-Brexit prospects.We wish him luck, with a historic Budget next month.Most of the reshuffle was welcome — three appointments in particular.New Attorney General Suella Braverman has an appetite to stop leftie campaigners getting like-minded judges to impose via their courts a political agenda rejected at the ballot box.Anne-Marie Trevelyan looks like the no-nonsense type to rein in the scandalous £.billion foreign aid budget.And Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will, we hope, ensure non-payment of the BBC licence is decriminalised before ushering in a subscription model.We do have one bit of advice for Boris as he prepares to deliver Brexit in full and spend billions, though: It is fine to bring the Treasury in line. But do not lose sight of the balance sheet.Gordon Brown did — and Britain is still counting the cost.ELLIE Gould fought back hard against her ex-boyfriend’s frenzied kne attack.It wasn’t enough.

Billions, for sure.What’s interesting is that the ship did not go down with all hands lost.There were  survivors — and they were able to tell rescuers where the Nuestra Senora had sunk. That information has not been lost.So why are we just sitting back letting Spain and Mexico get on with it Britain needs money for its exciting new railway line and all the hospitals Boris Johnson has promised.Andthere’s a small mountain of it sitting at the bottom of the sea off Mexico’s east coast, why don’t we just sneak over there and help ourselves Certainly, our new six-year-old Chancellor should be considering this . . .  once he’s finished his morning bowl of Frosties and tidied his room.Think about it. We have naval ships in the region waging a hopeless war against South American drug cartels. So why not simply ask them to drive around with their sonar on I feel sure thatthis equipment can find a near-silent Russian submarine gently humming its way through the depths, it would have no trouble at all spotting  tons of gold and silver.Or we could draft in RRS Boaty McBoatface . That’s designed to map the seabed and would be a very useful tool.Frankly, having it in the Caribbean looking for treasure is a much better use of it than having it wandering around Antarctica studying penguins and looking for more dreary evidence of climate change. We know already.I bet the crew would be happier too.Of course, when we do find the loot, Spain will claim it’s theirs, in the same way they say they own Gibraltar.No worries. We’ll just behave like we do when the Greeks say they want the Elgin Marbles back.And Mexico  It’s true the jewels and the gold were sourced from their neck of the woods.But as every schoolboy knows, it’s “finders, keepers”.Britain has a reputation for fair play and decency, but in a cut-and-thrust world we need to be a bit more devious.Maybe then we could find the loot and tell the world we hadn’t. “Nope. Nothing there. Sorry.”IF I were to list all the Bond music in order of greatness – and being a man, EVERYTHING has to be listed like this – Octopussy’s All Time High by Rita Coolidge would be the all-time high.I love Rita Coolidge. She sounds like she’s singing while sitting down.At No, from On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, I’d have We Have All The Time In The World, by Louis ­Armstrong, who sounds like he’s lying down in the bath. And at No it’d be the ­incidental music used during the ski chase in the same movie.I’d have to go a long way down the list – past Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from ­Thunderball, past the music used in the cinema adverts before the film started, and down past the Muzak playing when I took my seat – before I got to the dreary song chosen for the ­latest  outing.Performed by Billie Eilish, it is about as memorable as the middle of a Tuesday night.LIKE lots of box-set enthusiasts, I was captivated by Netflix’s drama The Stranger.“Let’s do one more”, I’d say every night. “Come on. It’s only am.”Set in northern England and starring Richard Armitage, the plot twisted and turned, building to the point that in the final episode I started to wonder how all the endless storylines could all be brought together and tied off.I was intrigued. Fascinated. On the edge of my seat.And then – with a load of stuff still up in the air – it just ended.What I had sat through, then, was a beautully told eight-hour joke. With no punchline.THE BBC has signed up Greta Thunberg to present a new series about monster truck racing in Texas.Only kidding. She’s been signed to present a show on – you’ll never guess – climate change.“I can’t wait. It’ll be so exciting,” said no one.I’VE always said hybrid cars are too heavy, thanks to the fact they have two engines.And now this ­photo of a Toyota Prius proves it.NORMALLY, I’m in full agreement with The Sun’s television critic, Ally Ross.But his review of ­Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab show on Netflix was wide of the mark.He described it as “dumb and dangerous”.Wrong, mate. It was way worse than that.At one point, they had two women playing with a vibrator the size of a JCB.And somehow they managed to make the scene even more boring than The One Show.WHENEVER somebody builds a really good bridge, I’ll travel miles out of my way to go and look at it. I realise this is a bit tragic.My favourite bridge in the whole wide world spans the Humber.It’s so graceful and delicate – and when I stand at one end and watch it disappear into the mist on a summer’s morning, I often suffer from a small but embarrassing trouser moment.The only annoying thing about the Humber Bridge is that they went to all the trouble and expense of building it simply to connect the small village of Hessle to the even smaller village of Barton. Two places no one has ever heard of.The fabulous Oresund Bridge was needed because it links Sweden and Denmark.It’s the same story in San Francisco, which has many great bridges that connect the city to the rest of Calornia.That’s the point of a bridge. It links two places that need to be linked.Which brings me on to Boris Johnson’s plan to build a -mile bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.Hmmm. I’m aware the Chinese have built a sea bridge this long, but this is a nation that built a whole new coronavirus hospital in SIX DAYS.We are just not that fast. We can’t even build a new railway line without a -year argument.And the fact is that when we finish our new bridge, midway through the rd Century, we will have linked a place called Larne to a place called Portpatrick.Now, I don’t want to have a downer on the plan.Butwe are going to build a -mile bridge over the sea, wouldn’t it be more usefulit went from Dover to Calais Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.“I find Portman’s type of activism deeply offensive to those of us who actually do the work. I’m not writing this out of bitterness, I am writing out of disgust,” she wrote.Unfortunately, coming from someone who has been so integral in the protest movement, this sounds like sour grapes.Natalie’s response to Rose’s criticism was as elegant and as understated as her protest.She said: “I agree with Ms McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me ‘brave’ for wearing a garment with women’s names on it.“Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks.”She also responded to Rose’s accusation that Natalie has only been directed twice by women.But in this criticism, Rose is seriously missing the point. Female directors don’t get as far in Hollywood as male ones, which is precisely what Natalie is pointing out with her cloak protest. Therefore, there are fewer available to work with.As Natalie said: “It is true I’ve only made a few films with women. In my long career, I’ve only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times . . . Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.“Female films have been incredibly hard to get made at studios, or to get independently financed. If these films do get made, women face enormous challenges during the making of them.”By the way, this is not the first time Natalie has protested from within the system.While presenting the best director category at the Golden Globes in , she introduced the line-up by saying: “And here are the all-male nominees.”Again, it’s not a shouty, noisy street protest. But it served to make her point. Just that she did it in a dferent way than Rose might. And that’s fine.In fact, some people think that Rose’s in-your-face type of protest risks alienating some people.I think women should support each other when it comes to vying for equality.But also, Rose just sounded spiteful when she said Natalie was “an actress acting like someone who cares”.Rose is a hero to many women. But she needs to understand that whether their contribution is big or small, loud or subtle, anyone’s effort to affect change helps.JANE Fonda, who looked fabulous at the Oscars, has said she is done with plastic surgery.Well, I guess  is as good an age as any to stop nipping and tucking.She must have a great doctor, as whatever the actress has had done has been done very well indeed – because, in my experience, it’s not often you look better after a facelt than you did before.PERHAPS Andrea Leadsom had a premonition that she was going to be axed as Business Secretary in this week’s Cabinet reshuffle.She recently wrote a column obliquely warning Boris Johnson not to cut the number of female ministers in his Cabinet.Addressing the issue of female board members among FTSE  companies, Andrea wrote: “Working in the City in the Nineties, I saw myself how a male-dominated environment can limit a career.”Unfortunately for her, the warning did not save her skin and she has been sacked, along with Theresa Villiers as Environment Secretary and housing minister Esther McVey.By the way, eight of the  members of Mr Johnson’s first Cabinet were female –  per cent.Despite these sackings, that figure has actually risen – slightly – to nearly  per cent.Ideally, the split would be an even -.But the reality is that business and politics can both be brutal.Men and women alike must accept they might one day get the sack.It simply goes with the territory.Being selected on the basis of gender is just as wrong as being sacked on that basis.Right person, right job, regardless of their gender.THAT is what true equality means.SAY what you like about the bonkers lestyle advice dispensed by Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop – and some of it is seriously out there.But whatever she is doing clearly works.She is, at the age of , nothing short of radiant.In fact she looks amazing and also happy.Not only that but she became instantly relatable to parents everywhere with a confession that her -year- old daughter finds her embarrassing.That’s a good reminder there is nothing like a teenager to keep you normal and down to earth for fear that you will embarrass them, no matter what you do.Although, to be fair, perhaps Gwyneth’s daughter has had a predisposition to feel embarrassed by her mother ever since she named her  . . . Apple.What are the ethics of seat-reclining on a long-haul flight An American Airlines passenger raised the question after video-shaming a fellow traveller who punched and pushed her seat when she reclined it.Bearing in mind the recline button moves the seat about in, I suspect this chap has anger issues, as reclining a seat that has a recline button is hardly an act of aggression.I’d disable the recline button and then all you have to fight over is the armrest.DAMIAN Hurleys resemblance to his mother, Liz, is uncanny.More so than ever in the latest shots of the two of them together, which he posted online this week.Some people think it is vaguely unsettling that he looks more like Liz Hurley than Liz Hurley.But as a mum myself, I think it’s heartwarming a teenage boy should be so happy to emulate his mother.OH the utter folly of the face tattoo!The latest to succumb to this trend, which a few years ago would be, frankly, unthinkable, is Amber Rose.She has had the words Bash and Slash tattooed across her forehead in old English manuscript style.It’s a reference, apparently, to the model’s three-month-old son Slash, and six-year-old son Sebastian.

We truly do.But do Harry and Meghan understand and ever admit to themselves that they owe EVERYTHING to their royal connections Without the magic dust that royalty bestows, JP Morgan — one of the world’s richest banks — would never have flown them in a private jet to an exclusive company beano. Don’t tell Greta Thunberg!And without his royal blood, Prince Harry would not be in talks with Goldman Sachs about a future relationship.If they were not British royalty, Meghan would be a B-list actress whom few people had ever heard of and Harry an old soldier with two rotten A-levelsfrom Eton — a school where my dog Stan could get four good grades and an offer from Oxbridge.I do not doubt Harry and Meghan’s sincerity when they say they want to be financially independent.But because they are poncing on royal connections, the couple have a duty of care to the Queen and to this country.Please don’t embarrass the Royal Family, or British people who shelled out £million for your wedding.Please do not turn into the preening glove puppets of investment bankers.Oh Harry, please don’t turn into Tony Blair in a tiara.Oh Meghan, don’t become the st-century Fergie.Prince Andrew’s reckless friendship with convicted billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein has humiliated and damaged the Royal Family.Andrew’s total lack of judgment may have done irreparable harm to the monarchy.Many of us wonderthe institution will last after the Queen has gone.So show some dignity, Harry and Meghan. Engage your brains, not your bank balance.Have a little DISCRETION. Please do not pimp your royal connections to any passing dodgy billionaire or investment banker who claims to care deeply about your charity work.Frankly, it doesn’t look good so far.The nation cringed when Prince Harry buttonholed Disney boss Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King, aggressively pitching Meghan’s availability for “voiceover” work.A member of the Royal Family begging a Hollywood big-shot for work was not a pretty sight.When they handed in their letter of resignation, Harry and Meghan made lofty announcements about “collaborating” with the Queen, as though Her Majesty, , is some grime DJ who could be brought in to remix their latest single.The brutal truth is that we will not see much of Harry and Meghan in these parts.This week they sacked  loyal UK staff and shut their Buckingham Palace office.But by turning their backs on the royal le, Harry and Meghan have placed themselves in an almost impossible situation.They claim to want to be financially independent of Prince Charles and the British taxpayer.Then they will have to grab the big pay days where they can.They will have to earn phenomenal sums of money to fund the lavish lestyle to which they are accustomed.But there is absolutely nothing in either of their CVs to suggest they can make that kind of dough without flogging their royal connections to the highest bidder.If Harry and Meghan are going to support themselves, they are going to have to get their hands dirty in the working world.Harry’s discussions with Goldman Sachs may be focused on his charity work right now, but investment bankers are not renowned for their boundless human compassion.Big bankers — and mega-rich companies like Netflix and Apple — will look at Harry and Meghan and wonder what they can get out of them.Harry and Meghan are free to demean themselves, as Harry did so spectacularly when he shook his diamond-encrusted begging bowl at the boss of Disney.But please don’t demean this country.Please don’t debase the Royal Family, as Prince Andrew has done.Please, Harry and Meghan — do not embarrass the Queen.Because let’s face it, chaps — without your royal connections, the pair of you really don’t add up to very much at all.After all those wild decades, Keith – who is said to have smoked an estimated , fags in his time – clearly believes in moderation in all things.Especially moderation in moderation.IN a pithy turn of phrase worthy of Oscar Wilde, one commentator mused that Labour’s dishevelled Tracy Brabin looked like she had been “banged over a wheelie bin” in her off-the-shoulder frock in the House of Commons.Showing Tracy how it is done, Kate Beckinsale looked stunning in a very similar off-the-shoulder number at a pre-Oscars party.Kate also looks as though she has never even seen a wheelie bin.But it’s not true.

six-hour operation to remove a tumour which had grown around Leahs spineShareCommentsByJess FlahertyGrace Witherden:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsDad Stephen with daughter Leah \" to FREE daily email

Seven-year-old Leah had le-changing surgery to remove the tumour which had grown around her spine and key blood vessels in August last year.Parents Stephen and Claire Bennett, from St Helens, Liverpool,  were told by other hospitals the operation would be too risky to perform but eventually their daughter was saved by staff at Alder Hey and Royal Liverpool hospitals, reports the Liverpool Echo.Before the six-hour operation a D model was made of the tumour which Stephen held. He said: Staring at it in front of my eyes was just horrying - it looked huge and holding it made the hairs on my neck stand up. He added: I held in my hands the very thing that was killing my little girl and that is quite a chilling experience. I had a strange mix of both extremely positive and extremely negative emotions going through me. Claire was unable to hold the model as she found it too dficult. Leah was diagnosed with the tumour last year after suffering from back ache on and off. When the couple were first shown the MRI scan, Stephen said it was completely horrying.  Stephen, , said: You start to think, how the hell is she going to beat this  How could this have possibly grown inside her without us knowing  It was completely horrying. I felt so empty and helpless and like I had let her down and failed as a parent. The parents were told that surgeons from Great Ormond Street, Bristol and Manchester had all given the opinion that surgery was not even possible for Leah, but Claire begged a consultant to speak to the surgical team to seethe was anything they could do to remove the tumour. After the team began to operate, Leah was only given a  per cent chance of surgeons being able to remove the tumour without it causing major harm like paralysis due to the damage it could cause to her spinal cord, or death.The surgery was carried out by Joanne Minford, Matthew Jones, Fiona Murphy and Professor John Brennan - a vascular specialist from Royal Liverpool Hospital. After the couple were told the operation was successful they broke down into floods of tears. After the success of the six-hour operation, Leah was discharged and home in time for her seventh birthday. She has also been fundraising for the hospital with her sister Phoebe.

William Smith was working as guard in the city centre when he recognised killer Michael Foran and alerted police. Foran strangled his girlfriend June Jones and then repeatedly stabbed her in a brutal attack at her West Bromwich flat in December . After going on the run, Foran was eventually tracked down and sentenced to le in prison in October .Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Will said: I told [West Midlands Police] what Iaposd seen. They asked me to send the pictures, I sent them to them.They said theyaposd get to Liverpool for the Saturday morning. They came, introduced themselves and within half an hour this male was detained. June Katie Jones, , was found with  kne wounds around her neck and the left side of her chest and is believed to have lain dead in the bath of the flat she shared with Foran for three weeks before she was found. Her body was only discovered when police forced their way in to the property on New Yearaposs Eve, .  William identied him following a public appeal and alerted West Midlands Police to his whereabouts. Dad-of-six Will shared a chain of emails between himself and West Midlands Police in which an officer thanked him for helping them capture the wanted man.  In one message a detective working for the force told the -year-old security guard: Thanks Will, all down to you! Will said he wanted to make sure Foran was caught: Iaposm a father. I have a daughter, I have granddaughters. He claims he attempted to report the sighting of Foran to Merseyside Police before contacting the West Midlands force. However, a spokeswoman for the force said Merseyside Police were unable to locate any log of this call to operators.  Will received an award from Interr, the security company he is employed by at River Island, for his efforts in helping capture a wanted murderer. Foran, , from West Bromwich, was captured on CCTV leaving his flat with friend Keith OaposDwyer before  escaping to Liverpool in his accompliceaposs car. On January , Foran was spotted on a camera at an Esso petrol station in  Anfield and police said they believed he had  fled to the city in the hope of travelling to Ireland and evading justice. Just four days later, detectives confirmed that Foran was found  begging on the streets of Liverpool city centre, almost four weeks after police believed June was murdered on December .  He was arrested and transported back to the West Midlands where he was charged with Juneaposs murder. A Birmingham Crown Court In October , Foran was sentenced to le in prison to serve a minimum of  years before being eligible to apply for parole. Keith O’Dwyer, , from West Bromwich, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender. He was sentenced to  months in prison. The family of June, also known as Katie, released the following statement moments after he was sentenced.

Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  n  n   nSimon  nSimon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold.  nThe lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP.  nThe speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”.  nI heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour.  nSimon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it.  nBeside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.”  nSimon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help.  nThe nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic.  nI saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.”  n“Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.”  nI broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.”  nThere are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces.  n“Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ”  n“I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ”  n“One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ”  nI saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved.  n“Go on,” he said cautiously.  n“OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ”  nA rueful roll of the eyes.  n“No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.”  n“Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.”  n“I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie.  n“Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.”  nSophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.”  n“I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time.  n“You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness.  n“It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.”  nSimon and Sophie were quietly crying.  n“How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly.  n“I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.”  nSimon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled.  n“OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.”  nWhen people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.  n  nTop news stories from n   n nAdele  nAdele has spent the last three months of her le in an urban specialist cancer centre.  nIn all that time, she has not felt fresh air.

When patients are admitted, many are fearful of death. But Rachel and her colleagues are determined to help them live le to the full before they die. In a second moving extract from her book Dear Le: A Doctor’s Story of Love and Loss, she remembers some of the patients and their stories which will stay with her forever... Dorothy Dorothy was admitted to the hospice on a Monday. “There is no point in spending time with me,” she declared on arrival. “I will be dead on Thursday.” “What makes you think that ” I asked, intrigued. She gave me the kind of lingering stare a teacher reserves for the classroom dunce, then explained: “Mr Edwards. The senior consultant on the surgical ward told me my bowels had stopped working and I would be dead in six days. That was on Friday. I have three days left.” I knew the rudiments of Dorothy’s story. Admitted to AE with acute bowel ­obstruction. Given her age –  – an almost certainly terminal diagnosis. But at no stage was there mention of Thursday. “I will concede I do not feel full of death,” Dorothy stated. “I feel full of le. Butyou don’t mind, I would rather be left alone. I have little time left and I would like to read my newspaper.” Rarely in my career had I been dismissed more magnicently. I hardly dared respond. “Based on my medical assessment, I am not at all certain you’ll be dead on Thursday,” I told Dorothy. “If you had more time, is there any way you would like to spend it ”  “Were I not to be dead on Thursday, then I would certainly be playing bridge with my local group, as I have done every Thursday for the last two decades. But I can assure you I will be dying instead.” “How about this,” I proposed. “We plan for bridge, unless death intervenes ” “Young lady, I will humour youit makes you feel useful.” A good day, for me, in the hospice, is one in which I feel we have helped someone die with comfort and dignity intact. But infinitely preferable are the days when we have helped a dying patient live – be that basking in a bath filled with insanely priced bubblebath, stroking the family Labrador, saying a rushed but no less momentous “I do” from a wheelchair decked in flowers in the hospice chapel, or watching gold finches gleam in the trees outside. In a ward where every patient has a terminal diagnosis, le, in all its loveliness, goes on. On Thursday morning, the nurses busied themselves with washing, sprucing, plumping and preening. When Dorothy finally emerged, dressed for her bridge trip, she could have been Boudica. Desperately thin, her chariot a wheelchair, a pre-emptive dose of morphine in her veins, yet nonetheless sitting ramrod straight with crocodile handbag perched on her lap and an impeccably coordinated green tweed skirt, cashmere cardigan and court shoes. Flushed with all the fuss and attention, Dorothy was, for that Thursday only, the queen of our ward – and she knew it. For a moment, our eyes met, and she nodded ­imperceptibly.The next morning, when I arrived at her bedside to hear all about her trip, Dorothy bemoaned her poor form. “I simplywasn’t as sharp as usual,” she lamented.I raised an eyebrow. “To be fair, Dorothy, no one  around the table had the excuse that they were dying,” I observed. “Did anyone  seem to mind ” A mischievous grin, a twinkle in her eye, and then, finally, I was ­liberated from the dunce’s corner with the words: “Dr Clarke, it was magnicent.” A few days later, Dorothy died. Mr Edwards, it turned out, was wrong by only  hours, but in that time, how his patient lived.  Simon Simon, a former policeman in his sixties, had retired a few months earlier. Shortly afterwards, he noticed a lump in his neck, painless, innocuous and perhaps, he had assumed, related to a recent head cold. The lump continued to grow. Still more curious than concerned – he regularly ran  miles before breakfast – he visited his GP. The speed of his referral to hospital impressed him, innocent of the fact he was on a two-week cancer pathway. The scan became a biopsy, the biopsy a consultant, murmuring cryptically about inoperability, as Simon sat stricken, pinned to his seat, hearing nothing of substance after “cancer”. I heard him before I set eyes on him. Specically, I heard the sound of air being sucked into his lungs through an airway severely compressed by a tumour. Simon was sitting bolt upright, eyes darting, his shirt ripped off and both hands gripping the bed like his le depended on it. Beside him stood a woman in her thirties, distraught and dishevelled, saying, “It’s OK, Dad. Look. Look, the doctor’s here. ­Everything’s going to be OK now.” Simon stared up at me, gulping for air. There was no way he could sustain this work of breathing. If, as I suspected, panic had exacerbated his airway obstruction, then I knew how to help. The nurses brought the large dose of ­steroids that would, I hoped, begin to shrink the swelling in Simon’s neck. Next, a tiny dose of a fast-acting sedative, just enough to take the edge off his panic. I saw his daughter Sophie was crying. He began to describe living alone with cancer, having been widowed a few years previously. “It’s all been so quick. Too much to take in. Sophie,I’m honest, is my rock, but she has Timmy, her boy, to look after as well.” “Don’t be ridiculous, Dad,” Sophie ­interjected, almost angrily. “You know looking after you is no problem. We all love being with you, especially Timmy.” I broached the topic of the future. “Look, I’m not stupid,” he exclaimed. “I don’t have one, do I  This is it. I know what’s going on.” There are moments in medicine when what you say next feels as pregnant with risk as a surgeon’s first incision. The right words, used wisely, can bridge the airiest expanse between you and your patient but,misjudged, may blow trust to pieces. “Simon, are you the kind of person who likes to discuss everything frankly,” I began, “or do you prefer to take things one day at a time, without speculating about the future ” “I already know I’m dying,” he responded. “What  could you possibly tell me ” “One of the things I’ve noticed working here, Simon, is how often patients feel unable to ask about the thing they’re most preoccupied with, which is what it’s going to be like when they die – and I wonder whether this is something you’d like to talk about ” I saw horror distort Sophie’s face, as though I’d trespassed somewhere no doctor should tread but her father,anything, looked relieved. “Go on,” he said cautiously. “OK...we tend to see the same patterns in people with cancer who are approaching the end of le. One of the first things many patients notice is losing their strength, their energy. I’m guessing you’re already aware of that ” A rueful roll of the eyes. “No kidding. I used to run marathons. Can’t even get up the stairs now.” “That loss of energy gradually worsens. You might find you need a nap most days, more than one, probably. Then, one day, you realise you’re sleeping more than you’re awake. It’s not painful or horrible, it’s just immensely frustrating. Patients can find it helps to try and plan in advance a bit, saving up their energy for the things that really matter.” “Like Timmy,” Simon ­interrupted. “I like to know when he’s visiting so I can have a sleep beforehand.” “I didn’t realise that, Dad,” said Sophie. “Well, I want to give him my best, don’t I  And I don’t want to lose a second with him.” Sophie turned to me. “Timmy’s dad’s not around anymore, you see. Left when he was two. Only shows up around Christmas and birthdays. Dad’s more like his real father.” “I see,” I said slowly, computing the layers of loss. I went on. “Often, at the end, there aren’t any dramatic changes. That ­sleepiness continues. A patient finds they are sleeping nearly all of the time. “You stop feeling hungry and you don’t want to eat. You may stop feeling thirsty too. Then, one day, rather than sleeping, you slip into unconsciousness. “It’s not a distinction you are even aware of. Your brain is just more deeply unresponsive. Sometimes, I wonderthis is the body’s way of protecting the mind – you stop being afraid, you’re oblivious to it all.” Simon and Sophie were quietly crying. “How long do you think I have left ” he asked me directly. “I have no reason to think you are going to die today, Simon. I do think your time is short – weeks, not months, perhaps only very short weeks – but I would love to believe we can get you home for a bit,that’s what you would like.” Simon said nothing. The silence, though thick with emotion, was not strained. Finally, he raised his eyes and smiled. “OK. I will. Maybe I’ll get to my boy’s birthday too. Thank you, Rachel – I mean it.” When people askmy job is depressing, I reply that nothing could be further from the truth. All that is good in human nature – courage, compassion, our capacity to love – is here in its most distilled form.

Liam Maguire, , counts famous footballers and high-flying Dubai business men amongst his clients after launching his own business three years ago. Now, he earns big money cleaning, polishing and waxing cars, charge anywhere from £ to £, per job. But as Liam, from Rainhill, Merseyside, explains, itaposs more than just washing a few windows.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said: It falls down to who has the greatest level of OCD but doing it safely to ensure no excess contact or damage is caused to the car, while at the same time using high grade products to ensure the best finish.Everyday car washes can cause scratches and damage. I’m the guy you call to fix what they’ve caused and also promise you serious satisfaction. But it hasnapost always been fast supercars and rich businessmen for Liam, who has had to work his way up the ladder. He said: I started Urban Valets off the back of my old job. I worked for a company in St Helens since leaving school. I started at  as the aposrag handapos and I eventually became the valeting bay manager at , in charge of people twice my age with double the years in experience. I was unfortunately made redundant.My boss kindly helped me with a van and then became Urban Valets.I still to this day have a great relationship with my old boss and I also maintain his cars.” But the gamble paid off and Liam is now doubling his turnover year-on-year whilst working with some of the most luxurious cars in the business. Liam said: My services range from £ up to thousands. My highest paid job was £, and it took me a week solid. That was on a McLaren S in Manchester for a client who deals in Bitcoin and banking.As for my high profile clients, I never aimed for such football players as my business aim is to impress people who know about cars. I mean that in a respect in which to prove I’m the best at my job. Liamaposs first high profile client was the Red Bull drt masters racers, which then caught the attention of serious-level insurance brokers, multi-business owners who own supercars such as McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris. He said: My greatest achievement is working on the rarest and most expensive supercar that’s in the UK currently, a McLaren Senna. The price tag with upgrades costs around £.million. I’m the only detailer to ever touch one of these rare vehicles. The owner is from Dubai and personally requested me and another valeter to meet at the Birmingham NEC autosport car show and work on this vehicle. I also recently completed a week-long detail down in Essex on a rare show spec  BMW E i which has to be perfect as it is attending a show in Austria in May. I was down in Essex all expenses paid for a week for this, which means a lot to little old me from Merseyside.” Liam admits working with these high-level clients is aposnerve-rackingapos but says that he aposthrivesapos upon the moment and sees it as his apostime to shineapos. Liam said: I know I’m good, I believe in myself and every multi-millionaire I’ve ever met has been that impressed theyaposve sat and gave me advice and wisdom. Something money can’t buy I suppose, so that’s what I enjoy most about my job.With his reputation growing, almost as a by-product Liamaposs Instagram also rocketed.Nearly  people follow Urban Valet on Instagram, which Liam says is due to his bright personality. He said: My following grew massively on Instagram due to my attitude, I shined light on a boring industry and made it fun.  I simplied everything so people could be involved...I shared tips and hints on my Instagram posts and also allowed people to see me and my personality. So much so, that Liam even has people recognising him in the streets. He continued: I get people stopping me when shopping and eating out. Hey it’s urban valets”.

Parents Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children were living in a bungalow at a school where he once worked as a resident caretaker. But they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms. Through tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing. We were a happy family and we’ve been robbed. We just want to go home and be a family unit again. Are you a struggling parent  Email your story to webnews@mirror. We are being treated like criminals. I’m scared I am going to lose my children. I can’t sit back and do nothing. I have four children. I have to fight for them. The Davies and their two sons - Rhys, , and George,  - are now staying in two small rooms in a converted office block  minutes from home. Their daughters - Grace, , and Emily,  - are staying where. Stay-at-home mum Mrs Davies toldthat the family moved into the three-bedroom bungalow at the now-defunct Sheredes Senior School in Hoddesdon, Herts, in January  when her husband was hired.  She said they paid £. a month in subsidised rent, were responsible for bills and maintenance, and carried out modications to accommodate Mr Daviesapos disability from severe back pain. But in July  Mr Davies, , was sacked by the school - unfairly, he claims - and the family were ordered to move out, with the council saying his right to remain in the property automatically ceased in accordance with his Service Occupancy Agreement. The family refused to leave and this led to a y legal battle that made its way to the High Court in October  and Supreme Court in . At the High Court, the Davies argued that they should be allowed to stay in the home and the council had failed to consider the welfare of their children, who were raised in the bungalow.  But the court sided with the council, saying the familyaposs right to occupy the home ended with his job and they had been trespassing ever since he was dismissed. It allowed the council to move ahead with the eviction, but remained in the bungalow, located next to the school gates, and continued to pay rent. The Davies claim they werenapost notied when the council applied for permission to enforce the writ of possession and the case went to court without their knowledge last year, meaning they werenapost giving an opportunity to mount a challenge. Mrs Davies claims the family had no idea they were being evicted until enforcement officers knocked on her door on February .  The council said since the summer of  it had asked the family a number of times to leave voluntarily, but Mr Davies refused. It said it held off from evicting the family for two years while Mr Davies appealed, and the appeals ended last summer. The eviction was authorised by the court, but the Davies claim it was unlawful because they werenapost give notice. They have launched a new challenge, arguing they were deprived of their legal right to seek a stay, and a hearing is due to take place on March . Mrs Davies, whose family have launched an online petition to publicise their case, said tearfully: There was a knock at the door and there were seven enforcement officers there to evict us.  They saidwe did not go we would be arrested and face  weeks in prison. At the end of the day, there were  enforcement officers. We were told just to take emergencies like medication and paperwork and clothes. It was absolute hell, we were in pieces. It was intimidating. At that point, we had to just go.  She added: We were illegally evicted. We were never served a notice. The whole family has been split up. We’ve been told that the bungalow is to be sold. It’s all for profit, it is greed. The council said it has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the property. Mr Davies now works as a pest control supervisor in London. His we said he has suffered from depression and anxiety, and attempted to take his own le following a mental breakdown that occurred while he was working at the school.  He claims it was brought on by bullying and harassment in the workplace. Mrs Davies said he was sacked when he was on sick leave. Sheredes School closed in  - a year after Mr Davies was dismissed - and a new academy has since opened in its place. The council doesnapost run the school, but it still owns the bungalow at the site. After being forced out of the home, the family were put in two rooms in a hotel in Great Dumlow, Essex, and then moved into a former office block in Harlow. Mrs Davies said: The most distressing thing is Iaposm not with all of my children. Thereaposs no room for all of us.  We have two studio rooms with two single beds in each but they are not next door to each other. In my room there thereaposs a wardrobe with no hanging rail, a microwave, a washing machine and dryer, a fridge, a two-wing hob and a tiny bathroom. We have nothing to do. We have no TV. My children have no toys. All of our possessions are still in the bungalow and the locks have been changed. It was my husband’s th birthday last week, his presents are still in the home. Friends are taking care of their dog, two cats and budgee. Mrs Davies said the situation has brought anxiety and stress upon the family, adding: My sons are embarrassed. My -year-old said people are laughing because they know he was sleeping on the floor on a mattress at the hotel.

she needed to repay £, in child benefit to the government because of commission her partner had earnedShareCommentsByZoe Chamberlain:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum was stunned when she learned she and her partner had to pay back £, of child benefit because of a little-known rule. Lorraine Dyer, from Halesowen, West Mids, has child benefit paid directly into her bank account. But she and partner Gareth were shocked when they were told by HMRC they owed thousands back to the government due to commission he had received from his job as a recruitment consultant. A rule is in place whereby iniduals who earn more than £, have to pay back a certain amount of their child benefit in income tax. And earnings that tip them over the threshold can come from money earned as commission, overtime, bonuses or even a company car allowance. Gareth works as a recruitment consultant and didn’t realise that his commission had tipped him over the edge, Lorraine, who runs Mini First Aid classes, told Birmingham Live. “It’s the fact it came out of the blue that was so annoying,we had known we would have cancelled immediately! she said. We always follow all the rules and don’t try to cheat at anything. It seems HMRC are getting a nice tidy sum from something that they could have easily adjusted. Many of our friends experienced this too, so it seems weaposre not a minority! We received no notication, we were just told we had a £, debt. Then when we questioned it, they added on an additional fine for delayed payment. She added: The tax office said he was supposed to have sent self assessment tax s but he didn’t think he had to do this because he’s not self employed. He’s never had to do that before. “It gets set up automatically and then you just forget about it. It worked out to be around three years worth that we owed. It had been coming in for such a long time, around £ a month that we didn’t really notice it going in. They said we could pay it back in installments over a year but that’s quite a short timeframe. It’s money we could have spent on a holiday. The rule, which was brought in back in  but is not very well known, currently means families have to pay back one per cent for every £ they earn over the threshold. And Lorraine is not the first parent to be caught unawares by this rule. Richard and Rebekha Nicholls, from Grimsby, were told to pay back a hefty £, after encountering the same problem. In that case, Richardaposs company car was what tipped them over the limit. An HMRC spokesperson said customers liable to the High Income Child Benefit Charge can elect to opt out of receiving payments of Child Benefit and still receive the other advantages of claiming it. This includes protecting their NI contributions record, as well as ensuring their child receives an NI number in the future. They said: “We use a wide array of channels to reach those who may be liable to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Just four weeks ago the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were ­sticking to the official line about ­“iding their time between the UK and Canada”. They told us they were forging a future as ­“progressive” royals – serving the Queen on the one hand while p­ursuing their ­humanitarian ­mission. And, as they settled into a wealthy pal’s ­£million Vancouver ­mansion, their  dedicated Buckingham Palace staff were ­desperately trying to make sure the Sussexes have their cake and eat it. But Harry and Meghan had ­already lost their appetite for Victoria sponge at teatime.] They could smell all those free maple cookies and American pie. And just look at how they’ve ­started feeding off fatcat bankers at a summit in Miami hosted by JP Morgan. So now we know what “le out of the spotlight” means for the struggling Sussexes. Turning up at ­billionaires’ ­bashes to bang on about mental health, Princess Diana’s death and saving the planet – for a hefty fee. Meanwhile back in Blighty,  members of staff are negotiating ­redundancy ­pay-offs.  Because Harry and Meghan have stopped pretending they want to be part-time royals and are ­closing down their Buckingham Palace office. But before they go, some of those axed aides will still have to organise the farewell ­engagements lined up for the Sussexes. They include the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey on March , which the Queen ­asked them to attend. The monarch, who was so hurt by Megxit, wants to see Harry standing beside his ­brother William at the very heart of her family, before he finally quits the Firm.

Two bodies were pulled from rough seas on Saturday before the worst of the storm hit.One man was found following a huge search operation off Margate after an early-morning distress call, while another was found at Herne Bay. Leboats and the coastguard helicopter had been scouring the sea near Margate Harbour after reports of a man overboard, HM Coastguard said. In the other incident, Kent Police were called at .pm on Saturday to a report a person had been pulled from the sea in Herne Bay. The US National Weather Serviceaposs Ocean Prediction Centre reported winds up to mph and waves that could reach more than fthigh across the North Atlantic. Forecasters were expecting winds to reach mph along coastlines, while some parts of the country could witness up to .inof rain. Experts have warned that conditions amount to a perfect storm, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend.This includes amber warnings from midday on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and part of the South West saying that flooding could cause a danger to le.Thousands of travellers have had their flights grounded for safety reasons, with British Airways and easyJet confirming cancellations. More than  easyJet flights in and out of the UK on Saturday have been cancelled, while sports fans discovered several fixtures were also called off due to the weather. Residents in West Yorkshire, which was badly hit by flooding during last weekendaposs Storm Ciara, are being helped by British Army personnel sent out by the Ministry of Defence . A spokesman for British Airways said they are merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption, while a spokeswoman for easyJet confirmed  cancellations. Ryanair said all its flights are operating as normal.A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said: To minimise the number of flights cancelled at short notice we have taken the joint decision, alongside our airline and air traffic partners, to pre-emptively consolidate todayaposs schedule. A spokesman for Luton Airport said the airport is fully operational, but added that a number of cancellations are expected later on Saturday. The MoD said  personnel from th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be aiding the Environment Agencyin constructing barriers and repairing flood defences in Ilkley and Calderdale, while  Reservists from th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, have also been tasked with providing support where required. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. The EA said flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekendaposs Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already saturated ground. In England alone,  properties were left flooded when Storm Ciara struck, the EA said. North Wales Police said very high winds had led to debris and branches falling off trees and Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said it had rescued a motorist from a car stuck in flood water in the Liskeard area. Power cuts are also expected and there is a good chance that train and buses will see cancellations or delays and roads closed. The Met Office said the main areas of concern on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday. At just after pm on Saturday, there were  flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and more than  flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - in places across the country. Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey.

But after climbing to the top with the ring in his pocket, his nerves got the better of him.  nNext he took Sophie to a posh London restaurant to do the deed and backed out again – because he thought the scene was too busy.  nEventually he asked Sophie one morning in bed and they began ­planning a beach wedding in Cuba for  guests for October  last year.  nBut six weeks before the big day, Matt’s mum Elaine, , had a bad fall while doing DIY in her kitchen and developed an infection. She could hardly walk and medics told her she might not be able to fly.  n  n   nThomas Cook travel money card customers told to withdraw money now or lose it   nEx-Thomas Cook flight attendant aposmurdered by stalker who broke into flatapos   nDays later Sophie’s sister Kirsty, , was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Her emergency operation was booked for the week of the wedding.  nSophie and Matt, from Minehead, Somerset, decided to go ahead ­without her despite Kirsty being the chief bridesmaid.  nSophie said: “We were all ­devastated. Kirsty’s health was more important than the wedding but ­everything was already booked so we felt we had to go ahead.  n“Kirsty’s children Bertie, who is four, and seven-year-old Beatrice were meant to be my page boy and flower girl, along with their cousins, but they wouldn’t make it either.  n“I didn’t want my mum Paula to have to choose between Kirsty and me so I told her to stay in England to look after my sister, which meant my dad most likely wouldn’t come out to see me get married either.”  nJust when they thought things couldn’t get any worse, there was a blow four weeks before the ­ceremony when Thomas Cook went bust.  nThe couple had booked a £, wedding package with the firm at the Iberostar hotel in Playa Pilar in Cuba.  n  n   nThomas Cook passenger who drunkenly urinated and vomited in plane seat jailed   nSophie said: “Thomas Cook staff were convinced there was going to be a buyout. They sent us an email the night before the collapse saying ­everything would be OK.  n“But then we never heard from anyone again. The staff that we had been dealing with had lost their jobs.  n“I was already doubting whether we should board the plane because I was worried about my sister, and Matt’s mum was hobbling about with her foot.  n“In some ways it was a bit of a relief when Thomas Cook folded and we were told the whole thing was ­cancelled but, after everything that happened, we felt numb.”  nThe couple ended up booking a last-minute consolation holiday to Mexico and spent the day they were meant to marry on the beach. Last month they ­finally got back the £, they had paid for their ceremony, hotel and tickets.  nTheir guests, who had booked through Thomas Cook as well, also got their money back because the trip was covered by the Atol financial protection scheme.  n  nUKaposs best destinations for stag dos and hen dos including accommodation costs   n   n   nSophie’s sister Kirsty’s operation was a success and she is now almost fully recovered.  nBut the £, the couple spent on gts for their guests was wasted ­because they were etched with last October’s wedding date.  nSophie, a personal assistant, said: “We knew Cuba was a long way for our  guests to travel so bought ­everyone jewellery and watches to say thank you. Unfortunately it’s all now sitting upstairs useless.  n“All the napkins and table ­decorations and stationery had the date on too. So that’s also money wasted. It’s been a nightmare.”  nThe couple, who first got together in  while both working in HR at Debenhams, say planning a new date has left them feeling flat.  nSophie said: “It’s hard to get motivated to rearrange everything again.  n  n   n“We’ve started to throw some ideas around but nobody seems excited about it because they’ve been through all the disappointment with us. We are just disheartened.  n“My dress is a beautul summer one with little straps so I’d be keen to get married in sunshine.  n“But I don’t think we will go abroad after our last experience. I don’t want to risk any more bad luck.”  nTop news stories from nMatt said: “It’s a good job Sophie is not superstitious. She’s had quite a few warnings  n“We would like to get married this year but everyone already has their holidays planned so it’s quite hard to find a date.”  nSophie added: “Everything that could go wrong did. I reckon we should buy lottery tickets because we are due some good luck.”\",\"published\":\"--T::.Z\",\"title\":\"UKs unluckiest bride tells of cold feet, cancer and Thomas Cook hell\",\"url\":\"www.mirror news uk-news uks-unluckiest-bride-tells-cold-\",\"ratings\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Default\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Tesco\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Ian\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Terry\"],\"findings\":,\"metadata\":,\"keywords\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"analyzed_text\":\"EXCLUSIVE: Sophie Bohun, , is planning a second wedding after her first was called off following a string of calamities that wrecked her dream big day in Cuba nWhen Sophie Bohun booked her dream wedding she had no idea of the calamities that lay ahead. nSophie, , is a contender for Britain’s unluckiest bride after a ­series of traumas which ended with her big day cancelled. nBut she might have had an inkling things would not go smoothly after fiancé Matt Stevens chickened out from his proposal – twice. nMatt, , first planned to pop the question at the top of a volcano in Bali at sunrise.

Sophie, , is a contender for Britain’s unluckiest bride after a ­series of traumas which ended with her big day cancelled. But she might have had an inkling things would not go smoothly after fiancé Matt Stevens chickened out from his proposal – twice. Matt, , first planned to pop the question at the top of a volcano in Bali at sunrise. But after climbing to the top with the ring in his pocket, his nerves got the better of him. Next he took Sophie to a posh London restaurant to do the deed and backed out again – because he thought the scene was too busy. Eventually he asked Sophie one morning in bed and they began ­planning a beach wedding in Cuba for  guests for October  last year. But six weeks before the big day, Matt’s mum Elaine, , had a bad fall while doing DIY in her kitchen and developed an infection. She could hardly walk and medics told her she might not be able to fly. Days later Sophie’s sister Kirsty, , was diagnosed with mouth cancer. Her emergency operation was booked for the week of the wedding. Sophie and Matt, from Minehead, Somerset, decided to go ahead ­without her despite Kirsty being the chief bridesmaid. Sophie said: “We were all ­devastated. Kirsty’s health was more important than the wedding but ­everything was already booked so we felt we had to go ahead. “Kirsty’s children Bertie, who is four, and seven-year-old Beatrice were meant to be my page boy and flower girl, along with their cousins, but they wouldn’t make it either. “I didn’t want my mum Paula to have to choose between Kirsty and me so I told her to stay in England to look after my sister, which meant my dad most likely wouldn’t come out to see me get married either.” Just when they thought things couldn’t get any worse, there was a blow four weeks before the ­ceremony when Thomas Cook went bust. The couple had booked a £, wedding package with the firm at the Iberostar hotel in Playa Pilar in Cuba.  Sophie said: “Thomas Cook staff were convinced there was going to be a buyout. They sent us an email the night before the collapse saying ­everything would be OK. “But then we never heard from anyone again. The staff that we had been dealing with had lost their jobs. “I was already doubting whether we should board the plane because I was worried about my sister, and Matt’s mum was hobbling about with her foot. “In some ways it was a bit of a relief when Thomas Cook folded and we were told the whole thing was ­cancelled but, after everything that happened, we felt numb.” The couple ended up booking a last-minute consolation holiday to Mexico and spent the day they were meant to marry on the beach. Last month they ­finally got back the £, they had paid for their ceremony, hotel and tickets. Their guests, who had booked through Thomas Cook as well, also got their money back because the trip was covered by the Atol financial protection scheme.  Sophie’s sister Kirsty’s operation was a success and she is now almost fully recovered. But the £, the couple spent on gts for their guests was wasted ­because they were etched with last October’s wedding date. Sophie, a personal assistant, said: “We knew Cuba was a long way for our  guests to travel so bought ­everyone jewellery and watches to say thank you. Unfortunately it’s all now sitting upstairs useless. “All the napkins and table ­decorations and stationery had the date on too. So that’s also money wasted. It’s been a nightmare.” The couple, who first got together in  while both working in HR at Debenhams, say planning a new date has left them feeling flat. Sophie said: “It’s hard to get motivated to rearrange everything again.  “We’ve started to throw some ideas around but nobody seems excited about it because they’ve been through all the disappointment with us. We are just disheartened. “My dress is a beautul summer one with little straps so I’d be keen to get married in sunshine. “But I don’t think we will go abroad after our last experience. I don’t want to risk any more bad luck.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather 87mph storm dennis","story":"w.mantis  UK weather: mph Storm Dennis bringing more chaos with flooding and travel warningsThe destructive Storm Dennis has claimed two lives in Kent while the British Army was deployed to assist flood relief efforts after six inches of rain soaked Britain and mph winds were recordedaposBomb cycloneapos Storm Dennis continues to wreak havoc on Sunday with flight cancellations, road closures and severe flooding across the UK.  nThe Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings and  more alerts as spells of heavy and prolonged rain are expected to hit northern and parts of southern England.  nThe agency recorded highest levels on the River Ouse in flood-hit York and expected the river to peak on Monday evening.  nThe unsettled weather conditions are set to bring up to mm of rainfall on Sunday, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.  nPeople residing near the Scottish Borders have been warned to expect aposextensive flooding to properties and businesses, with many roads impassableapos.  n  n   nYorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe apossent ex-we Valentineaposs card and begged for visitapos  nMillions of sick Brits to be told aposstay at homeapos for  days in coronavirus fight   nThe Met Office has issued eight weather warnings - three yellow wind warnings and five amber rain warnings - covering most of the UK today.  nIt comes after Storm Dennisapos winds peaked at mph on Saturday and six inches of rainfall fell. nBritish Army troops have been deployed to support flood relief supports in West Yorkshire, as well as Scotland.  nDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it.

The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings and  more alerts as spells of heavy and prolonged rain are expected to hit northern and parts of southern England. The agency recorded highest levels on the River Ouse in flood-hit York and expected the river to peak on Monday evening. The unsettled weather conditions are set to bring up to mm of rainfall on Sunday, with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding. The Met Office has now issued a rare red rain warning for south Wales, with extensive flooding likely and communities facing being cut off. People residing near the Scottish Borders have been warned to expect aposextensive flooding to properties and businesses, with many roads impassableapos. The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings - three yellow wind warnings and five amber rain warnings - covering most of the UK today. It comes after Storm Dennisapos winds peaked at mph on Saturday and six inches of rainfall fell. British Army troops have been deployed to support flood relief supports in West Yorkshire, as well as Scotland. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. Storm Dennis claimed two lives yesterday - a -year-old teenager was died after entering the water at Herne Bay in Kent, while a man died near Margate - also in Kent - after going overboard from a Maltese-registered tanker that had anchored off the coast.  Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Steve Willington, said: “ Storm Dennis will bring another very unsettled spell of weather this weekend with a risk of flooding, particularly in parts of England and Wales and also southern Scotland, where snowmelt will add to the flood risk. With Storm Dennis bringing further heavy and persistent rain over the weekend, there is a risk of signicant impacts from flooding, including damage to property and a danger to le from fast flowing floodwater. We are advising people to sign up for flood warnings by phone, text or email and to access the latest safety advice on gov.uk by searching  ‘sign up for flood warnings’.

While the Chinese government said the outbreak started inside a wet market in Wuhan, scientists from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou said the possible origin of the virus could be from Wuhan Center for Disease Control . Scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao published a research journal titled aposThe possible origins of -nCoV coronavirusapos on Research Gate, where they claimed WCDC aposhosted animals in laboratories for research purposesapos, including  bats captured in the Hubei and Zhejiang provinces. The report mentioned one researcher, known as JH Tian, aposwas once attacked by batsapos and that aposthe blood of bat was on his skinapos. Tian quarantined himself for a total of  days after aposbats peed on himapos. The lab is located  metres from the infamous wet market and adjacent to the Union hospital where the first group of doctors was infected. It read: It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study. A second laboratory, located at approximately km from the wet market, was mentioned in the report, as it said: This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruswhich caused the SARS outbreak in . The laboratory is said to belong to Wuhan Institute of Virology and is classied as P, the highest level of biosafety laboratory. The plague has since spread to over  countries around the world and infected over , people. A total of , people on the Chinese mainland have died from the illness as of February , according to real-time figures provided by Chinaaposs National Health Commission.

They have warned that spraying yourself with chlorine or using hand dryers wonapost kill the deadly bug. It comes as China announced the number of new coronavirus cases in China fell on Sunday and a health official said intense efforts to stop its spread were beginning to work. Chinaaposs latest figures showed , cases of the illness and , deaths, most of them in Hubei. The National Health Commission reported on Sunday , new cases, down from , the previous day, and  new deaths, just one lower than the  on the previous day. All but four of the new deaths were in Hubei. The WHOaposs guidance comes after a coronavirus expert warned that the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories could lead to more cases in the UK. Professor Paul Hunter, of the University of East AngliaapossNorwich Medical School, said fake news leads to bad advice and people taking greater risks during health crises. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said on Thursday that many more people in the UK may need to self-isolate to contain the illness, which has been officially named Covid-. . Hand dryers will not kill coronavirus While people have been told to make sure to wash their hands regularly, using handryers will not the kill the virus. Rumours had been circulating that using a dryer for  seconds would zap the virus but that alone wonapost do it. The WHO said: To protect yourself against the new coronavirus, you should frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should dry them thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer. . UV lamps canapost sterilise your skin Ultraviolet lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation, he WHO said. UV lamps are often used by hospitals and labs to kill microbes, but are never used around humans. . Spraying alcohol or chlorine on your body wonapost get rid of virus Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over you will not kill viruses that have already entered your body, the WHO warns. While disinfectants can kill the coronavirus on surfaces, these chemicals should not be used on the skin Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes . Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations. . Eating garlic wonapost prevent you from being infected with coronavirus While eating garlic can help to treat the common cold, it wonapost stop you from being infected with coronavirus.One viral post did claim that eating a bowl of boiled garlic could cure the virus - it was later blocked on Facebook for being factually inaccurate.Garlic does have some antimicrobial properties but there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating it has protected people from the new coronavirus.  . Sesame oil wonapost block coronavirus from entering your body Putting sesame oil on your body wonapost block the coronavirus from entering your body. There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the -nCoV on surfaces. These include bleach chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, % ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, the WHO said. However, they have little or no impact on the virusyou put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin. . Pets canapost catch coronavirus At present, there is no evidence that companion animals pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the new coronavirus, according to the WHO. There had been reports of people in China abandoning their pets or throwing cats and dogs out of windows to their death over fears they could spread the virus.  The WHO adds: However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against ious common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans.  . Thermal scanners wonapost always detect people with the virus Thermal scanner are currently being used at airports, train stations and other public places to detect those with a high temperature. While these scanners after effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection with the new coronavirus - it wonapost pick up those yet to display symptoms. The WHO said: They cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between  and  days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. . Letters and packages from China donapost carry coronavirus Packages coming for China are safe. The WHO says people receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus. From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages, they said. . Pneumonia vaccines donapost protect you against coronavirus Scientists are working on a vaccine for COVID- but one is currently not available. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type Bvaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus, the WHO says. The virus is so new and dferent that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against -nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against -nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.  . Rinsing your nose with saline wonapost help prevent infection with the new coronavirus There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus, the WHO warns. There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold. However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections. . Young people can be infected with coronavirus People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditionsappear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.  WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.

Daria, , and Ivan, , have appeared on TV in Russia ahead of their babyaposs arrival to share details of their relationship. According to the children they met each other a year ago and fell in love at first sight. Daria, who is just eight weeks pregnant, said during the On Air show, which they appeared on with parental permission: A friend of mine introduced us and two days later we started dating. Ivan said he was in love with me. We tried to spend as much time together as we could. We like walking down the streets holding hands and kissing. But there are some questioning whether the -year-old boy could have fathered a baby at all. Local paediatrician Nikolai Skorobogatov said: Theoretically both children could have reached reproductive age. But Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, says Ivan could not be the father. He said: We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake. There cannot be sperm cells. He is still a child.  There is even no testosterone. And just to add, he still has childish sex organs. Puberty has not started. So we have a lot of questions. According to the girl, who is planning on keeping the child, she and her boyfriend take care of each other and set their social media as aposmarriedapos. The schoolgirl said: Ivan has gastritis and I do not allow him to drink carbonated beverages. Sometimes I worry about my weight but he says that I am in perfect shape and do not need to go on a diet. He is very kind. Daria revealed that she and Ivan had sex at his home when his mother was away. She said: After we did it for the first time, we hid from each other under the blanket out of shame. Soon after Daria started to feel sick and had nausea most days. The girl’s mother Elena took her to hospital for examinations but doctors failed to find the cause of her aposillnessapos. Finally, Elena bought a pregnancy test kit for her daughter. Elena, who was also participating in the show, said: The test showed that Daria was pregnant. After that, she confessed to having sex with Ivan.  I was in shock. I could not say a word. When we started talking she said she would not kill the baby and I support her decision. I do not want her to go under the kne. Ivan and his mother Galina, , are planning to help Daria to raise the child. Galina said: I did not know what to say after learning that my -year-old son fathered a child. I think Ivan himself does not quite understand what happened. He said they came to our apartment and Daria offered him to have sex.  They did not use any contraceptives and obviously did not realise the possible consequences. Some of the familiesapos neighbours express doubts over whether the boy is indeed the father. A man living next door said: I think somebody  got the girl pregnant and now they want to put all the responsibility on the boy. And a woman said: I do not believe the boy is the father of the child. I doubt he is developed enough for that. Father-to-be Ivan said: Daria has never been with another man. I know that for sure. I am the father of her baby. The children say they became a target for bullying in their hometown of Zheleznogorsk in central Russia’s Krasnoyarsk Krai region. Daria said: aposSome children from my school called me a w***e and said that I am sleeping around. I wanted to die after hearing that.

Paul Hartley played him further back in front of me and whoever I was partnering but I always felt he was more of a threat further up the pitch.“He creates real problems for defenders because they don’t know whether to follow him when he naturally drops back.“What Gowser does is take real care of the ball when he’s got it and he turns and can see a pass.“The ball he played through for Kane Hemmings’ second goal had to be right and he set the goal up.“I was delighted with Gowser up front and with Kane next to him.”With striking options limited following Danny Johnson’s departure in January and Andrew Nelson’s surgery, James says that plan would have been put to use the previous week against Morton.However, a knock picked up in training ruled McGowan out of the draw at Cappielow.And it was sporting director Gordon Strachan who reminded the Dark Blues manager of the possibility.McGowan started his career at Celtic while Strachan was manager at Parkhead and was given his debut in an advanced position.James added: “It’s something we would have done earlierwe could have.“We probably would have done it at Morton.“He started his career out there. That’s what Gordon keeps saying to me.“He played there when Gordon was at Celtic.“Gordon gave him his debut. He played in the Champions League for him against Villareal.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dens gaffer players have to pay back dundee fans","story":"Dundee boss James McPake expects his players to give the club’s fans something back in the last few months of the season as they target a second-place finish.It’s been a trying first season as a manager for the -year-old at Dens Park with form and fortunes of his side fluctuating from week to week.After two positive results in their last two outings – a - draw at Cappielow against Morton followed up by a commanding - success over bottom side Partick Thistle – the Dark Blues gaffer is hard at work trying to stretch those reults into an extended run of form that can see Dundee earn themselves a place in the end-of-season play-offs.At times, the club’s fans have voiced their frustration at the team’s inability to prove any sort of challenge to runaway leaders Dundee United.James understands that but was pleased to see another side to the home support in last weekend’s win over the Jags.“We gave them a reason to get behind us,” he said.“Early in the game, Kane Hemmings chased a ball down, it rebounds off the defender and we get a throw-in – everybody is buzzing just because Kano chased a ball.“The supporters are then up for it and they see the players are up for it, too, with balls into the box early on.”That was a prime example of the players getting the crowd onside and the manager is demanding more of that, particularly with four home games coming up in the six matches after next Saturday’s trip to Queen of the South.Arbroath and Alloa are a home double-header before Dunfermline and then Queens check in to Dens before the end of March.“We have to give them something to be proud of – I said as much in my first interview,” he added.“I think last Saturday the fans were proud of their team.“We might not have knocked the ball about or played as fluently as we have this season but we got the three points and came away with a clean sheet and looked really comfortable.“The fans will have walked away really happy.“I think that was probably the first time at Dens this season where they walked away saying ‘it was good today’.“We have to do that, it has to come from us.“The fans will help us when it’s backs to the wall but we need to give them something.“Last Saturday we did.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e184ad61963d8.69056156.jpg ","title":"forster happy to swap goal for clean sheet","story":"Jordon Forster admits he hasn’t dealt well with being out of the Dundee team but is delighted to have made a positive impact on his– evenhe’s had to begrudgingly give up claims for a first goal of the season.The big centre-back was taken out of the firing line back in December after a costly error against Queen of the South and a dficult day at the back in the following home match against Dunfermline.But he has responded with two strong performances that have helped the Dark Blues pick up four points from their last two matches with a draw at Morton followed up by Saturday’s - win over Partick Thistle.Speaking to the Tele, Forster admits his time out of the team hasn’t been the easiest.He said: “I was on the bench for a few games.“It was dficult to deal with and, being honest, I don’t deal with that very well!“It’s the manager’s decision at the end of the day.“I hope I’ve shown enough to remain in the team for the next game.“It’s part and parcel of football, the boys who came in have done well.“It is a team game, at the end of the day, we have a squad for the whole season and every single one in the squad is important.“As long as the team is doing well, it’s all good.”With the score at -, Forster thought he’d opened his scoring account for the Dark Blues as he powered a header goalwards only to see striker Kane Hemmings knock the ball over the line.“First goal of the season, yeah!” said Forster.“To be fair, Kane got the last touch on it. It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news. It was a good day all round.”The Dark Blues head into a two-week break in good mood after ending their run without victory ahead of a trip to Queen of the South on February .“It’s human nature,you lose then there’s two weeks to think about that until the next one.“It was nice to get the three points after the previous few weeks and gives us something to work on for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee emerge from the ashes and why lawrence shankland is just getting started","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss how Dundee got their season back on track, Lawrence Shankland’s pledge that more is to come and the Walk and Talk men’s mental health event.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-wallace-bruce-glasgow-bishop-shaped-scotlands-history","story":"ONE of the most puzzling aspects of Scotlandrsquos wars of independence is the way that prominent figures often changed allegiances, especially in the period when Robert the Bruce was fighting for ndash and indeed murdering his enemies for ndash the throne of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"masterchef-star-gary-maclean-chats-new-bbc-show-corner-shop-cook-off","story":"MASTERCHEF winner Gary Maclean will star in a new show that aims to prove you can cook a three-course meal for just pound with items bought from your local corner shop."},{"url":null,"title":"mini-golf-course-set-st-enoch-centre-plans-approved","story":"A MINI-GOLF course is set to open in the St Enoch Centre, a move which will see world famous toy store Hamleys downsize."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-help-shape-glasgows-response-ecological-emergency","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS response to the climate and ecological emergency can be shaped by the public after the council launched a new consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-farting-normal-talk","story":"Because everybody farts, itrsquos normal you see,"},{"url":null,"title":"city-science-plutos-journey-fascinating-one-planet-continues-surprise-us","story":"NEXT week marks  years since Plutorsquos discovery.

stations.Aberdeenshire Council is looking into the polling districts and polling places in the UK parliamentary constituencies of Banff and Buchan, Gordon and West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.Local authorities are required to carry out such reviews every four years, to ensure suitable facilities are being used and that they are accessible for voters, including those with a disability, where possible.Now it is inviting members of the public to have their say about the state of current polling stations.A statement from the local authority said: “Aberdeenshire Council is conducting a review of polling districts and polling places within the UK parliamentary constituencies of Banff and Buchan, Gordon and West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine.“Aberdeenshire Council uses a range of buildingsas polling places so that electors have a place where they can cast their vote in a space that meets their needs.“Aberdeenshire Council is required by law to carry out such a review every four years to ensure reasonable facilities for voting and that polling places are accessible to all electors, including voters with a disability, so far as is practicable.”Council-owned premises, including public halls, community centres and primary schools, are turned into polling places elections.Anyone who is interested in giving their opinions for the review is asked to contact Aberdeenshire Council by post or email elections@aberdeenshire.gov.uk by March .After this time, a report containing final proposals for polling places and polling district boundaries will be compiled for consideration at meeting of the council.Feedback gathered during the review is expected to be published within the reports.Anyone who does not wish their representation to be attributed to them by name is asked to indicate this clearly.Aberdeenshire Council leader Jim Gford said: “The council revises all our polling stations regularly to make sure that they are fully fit for purpose and to try to ensure that any election day operates as smoothly as possible.“We have changed and moved polling stations in the past for many reasons and are especially keen to avoid using any of our schoolsat all possible.“I would encourage everyone to respond to the consultation and let the council knowthey have any issues with any of our existing polling stations and also make suggestions of alternative venues that could possibly be used in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this.

The deeply traditional monks rise at am, eat in silence, even wash dishes to the sound of Latin hymns.They dress in identical ankle- black habits, shun possessions and retire to a small, basic cells with just a bed, a desk and a toilet.Monastic le ndash apart from their regularly updated blog and occasional YouTube video ndash has barely changed since the early monks of Papa Stronsay repelled Viking invaders who dared to interrupt their precious way of le.Work to create new accommodation to meet demand is expected to be carried out by hand by the monks, who have already transformed a former herring gutting shed into a chapel, and who rely on a small private vessel to link them to the nearest island, Stronsay.With no connection to the National Grid and just a generator to provide power, the monks also have plans to enter the modern age and install wind turbines on the island and to explore other forms of renewable energy.ldquoWe have seen the number of retreat requests increase signicantly over the years, says Fr Magdala Maria, rector at Papa Stronsay, which means \"priestsrsquo island of Stronsay\".ldquoThere is a plan for a church to be built. There will be larger facilities to cater for a larger number of retreatants.In addition to soaring interest from people seeking to spend time in retreat with the monks, the monastery also appears to be a magnet for tourists seeking to explore their remote island.ldquoThere are dferent types of visitors they who specically come to the monastery for some time away, spiritual retreats or peace and quiet. We receive our fair share of visitors as well from the curious, to those who are interested in historic sites, to those who come for religious reasons, he adds.ldquoWe are always receiving requests for visits even in the windy winter months in Orkney.Attractions for visitors to Papa Stronsay include Earlrsquos Knowle, the longest chambered cairn in the UK, the remains of th century St Nicolasrsquos Chapel, and a rare and perplexing duo of kelp-burning kilns connected by tunnels.The Transalpine Redemptorists, also known as The Congregation of the Sons of The Most Holy Redeemer, formed in  in order to continue the tradition of celebrating Latin mass. They bought Papa Stronsay  years later for around pound,.Old herring industry buildings were converted to become a refectory and chapel, and a row of cells were built containing simple furnishings to accommodate up to  monks.Fr. Magdala Maria adds: ldquoWe have a steady number of young men joining which is always encouraging to see, so the future seems secure.Any rise in visitors and interest in Papa Stronsay is likely to be welcomed by the  islanders of Stronsay, just six minutes away by boat, where efforts have been under way for the past two years to lure more tourists.The seven-mile-long island, known as \"Orkneyrsquos Island of Bays\", currently attracts around  tourists a year to its rugged coastline, dramatic seascapes, sheltered beaches and history ndash flint arrowheads believed to be , years old have been found on the island.However, reaching Stronsay can be challenging: the five-times-a-week flight from Kirkwall to Stronsay takes just eight minutes, but spaces are limited the ferry may be cheaper but itrsquos an hour and a half just to get there.Reaching the monastery at Papa Stronsay means calling ahead and arranging for a boat.ldquoStronsay has put in quite an effort to lt its profile both as a holiday destination and somewhere to live and work. As well as housing and better ferry services, we need employment, says Stronsay-born and bred North Isles councillor Graham Sinclair.ldquoWhat holds tourism back is the lack of Scottish Government funding for a better ferry service. Itrsquos woefully poor compared to the Western Isles.Fresh hope has come from a controversial source: in October, go-ahead was given by Orkney Islands Council for two new fish farms ndash the first in the Stronsay area.Located in two of the islandrsquos three large sandy bays, they will occupy picturesque spots where grey seals, harbour seals, otters and other wildle currently thrive undisturbed.The Mill Bay and Bay of Holland fish farms will each comprise  circular cages, each  metres in circumference and both serviced by their own -tonne feed barge.Cooke Aquaculturersquos new farms will create up to nine jobs ndash however, some have questioned the impact on seals, fish stocks, crab and lobster, as well as expressing fears about the potential visual scar on the unspoiled landscape.However, Cllr Sinclair says the farms are largely welcomed: ldquoTherersquos a buzz on the island just now. The fish farms are in development stage, and thatrsquos brought a buzz over the prospect of new jobs in a small community.Fish have always played a role in the islandsrsquo industry: Papa Stronsay was once a centre for the herring industry, and at its height in the s, up to  people lived and worked there.At peak times, so many herring boats packed into the Sound of Papa that it was possible to walk across the boats from Stronsay to Papa Stronsay without touching the water.The fishing industry collapsed after the Second World War and native islanders left. Today, around % of Stronsayrsquos population is said to be made up of non-native Orcadians.According to Fr. Magdala Maria, a rise in visitors to the two islands would not adversely affect their peaceful solitude.ldquoWe are not concerned about an increase of tourism, in fact we welcome it, he says.ldquoOne can say that we have contributed to the influx of visitors to the island of Stronsay over the years. Many of our family members and friends have visited from all over the world, being an international community of monks.ldquoWe always encourage visitors to our island.ldquoAt the same time we want to keep our treasure, Papa Stronsay, a place of joyful silence and solitude, where people can come here to enjoy peace, tranquility and experience the presence of God."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-film-festival-one-mans-journey-depth-despair-top-world","story":"Standing on the top of the world with Everest under his feet and a dark, disturbing secret embedded in his heart, David Tait felt a kind of euphoria wash over him.Getting there had taken years of chaos and destructive behaviour. Friends, family and lovers had been trampled over, his hedonistic City traderrsquos lestyle and disregard for others had left a trail of misery in its wake.Conquering the worldrsquos highest peak brought a natural high that Tait, first raped aged  by a relative then appallingly abused throughout his childhood, had never experienced before.ldquoSomething extraordinary happened, he recalls. ldquoIt was euphoric, I never felt better. I realised I had found something.On the ,ft summit, years of suppressing the horrors of his childhood lted.Tait, a successful City trader and top banker with Credit Suisse who had already quietly resolved to turn those awful childhood experiences into a force for good, vowed to take the next step and share his distressing yet powerful story.Now a harrowing but uplting film that depicts how he overcame a childhood blighted by sexual predators and which scarred his journey into adulthood will receive its world premiere at Glasgow Film Festival.Sulphur And White, which stars Anna Friel as Taitrsquos broken mother and Fe-born actor Dougray Scott as his cruel father, throws light on the deeply distressing impact of child sex abuse and the ripple effect that shatters the lives of not only its young victims but those around them too.Using flashback sequences, it links years of abuse and suppressed hurt with Taitrsquos subsequent destructive and self-indulgent behaviour which triggered the breakdown of his first marriage and two suicide attempts.Although it is deeply disturbing, Tait says he is hopeful the film will encourage debate over the far-reaching impacts of child abuse, and help lt the stigma that may discourage victims from seeking support and avoid a descent into a troubled adulthood.ldquoIrsquod like the film to be a defining moment in recognising that the victim also creates many, he says, adding: ldquoThere are animals out there and all we can do is try to protect children.His ordeal began when he was just  years old while working for a relative in a tearoom in Deptford Park, south London. Caught pinching a chocolate bar, Taitrsquos punishment was to be brutally raped and warned not to tell.The assaults continued for an entire summer and included episodes involving groups of men, with the youngsterrsquos head covered with a sack to protect the identities of his attackers. Later, Tait was subjected to abuse from his own father.The film explores how that abuse affected his adult relationships and how, having been driven to the brink, he pulled back from taking his own le and resolved to stop allowing events of the past to dictate his behaviour.He went on to climb Everest five times and raise pound. million for childrenrsquos charity NSPCC, which supports young victims of abuse.Of the film, he says: ldquoI realised there was a chance to do three things. The first was to educate those who donrsquot understand what sexual abuse of children is. I know some remarkably clever people who, when they saw the film, turned to me and said they didnrsquot understand that went on. I thought everyone did.ldquoSecondly, therersquos a lot of collateral damage created by the victim ndash me. Over the years I have created so much mayhem. I want to destigmatise it, talk about [abuse] and bring it out into the open.ldquoThirdly, there was no NSPCC for me. And I hope the film will show that children donrsquot have to go through  or  years of misery before getting help.Tait, , first decided to speak openly of his childhood experiences as he prepared for his second Everest climb, signing off an email calling for support towards his fundraising for the NSPCC with the line: ldquoBecause I was one of those kids.His last Everest expedition in  almost ended in tragedy when he was caught in an avalanche.Sulphur And White is among nine world premieres at the -day film festival. Others include Flint, from Scotland-based director Anthony Baxter, which unravels scandalous betrayal and hypocrisy around Michiganrsquos water supply, and Pictures From Afghanistan which follows The Herald and The Herald on Sunday photojournalist David Pratt as he s to the country.More than  films will make their UK debut, among them Edinburgh-based Mark Cousinsrsquo -hour documentary Women Make Film, a tribute to women filmmakers which will be screened in five instalments, and Dirt Music starring Kelly Macdonald as an Australian outback we trapped in a miserable marriage.The festival closes on International Womenrsquos Day with every film screened that day either directed or written by a woman, or featuring a female lead.Mark Stanley, who played Grenn in the HBO series Game Of Thrones, and who portrays Tait in the film, and co-star Emily Beecham, who plays his we, Vanessa, and who last year won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for her part in Little Joe, are lined up to attend the world premiere of Sulphur And White.The film tackles the complicated relationship between Tait and his mother, and explores how the support of his we and birth of his children brought new focus into his le.ldquoI feel dferent almost every time I see it, he says of the film. ldquoThere are one or two points regarding my mother that are devastating ndash two scenes leave me helpless every time I watch them.ldquoIt was probably harder for me to read the script than to watch the film. I realised this sequence of events in my le that seemed very disjointed had been crafted into something that was an interesting story.Sulphur And White will receive its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival on Friday, February , at the Glasgow Film Theatre, and be released in cinemas on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-tories-want-second-referendum-claims-former-party-spin-doctor","story":"The idea of holding another vote has always been a firmly rejected by party leaders, with the official stance of \"No to Indyref\" appearing throughout the general election campaign of last year.The partys new leader, Jackson Carlaw, has also said he is against holding a second referendum.However Andy Maciver, the partys former head of communications and now director of think tank Message Matters, said he has been in several conferences and talks with leading party members who say they are in favour of holding another vote on the constitution.The former adviser said: \"The reality of next year is that it is all about how the Scottish Conservatives deal with indyref.\"There is one camp who thinks they have to say yes to indyref, and the other are saying It was once in a generation, the SNP are mucking up the country and people will realise that.:Jackson Carlaw elected new leader of Scottish Conservatives\"I have been involved in conferences on both sides here, but there are very senior people on both sides of this and that is a problem for the Tories.\"That is the biggest thing Jackson Carlaw has to deal with.\"Many of the Scottish Tories have got a hope that the SNP have got policy problems, in education and so on.

University researchers will explore the history of islands such as Coll and Tiree, Barra, Benbecula, Skye and Raasay as well as mainland sites such as Glen Coe, Lochaber and Wester Ross.They are looking for tales handed down the generations, such as those from the Clearances, when many of these areas were denuded of the communities which had been their leblood.Mass migration of Scots from the islands and crofts of Argyll and beyond to the New World will also be recorded, as will the myths and legends handed down from the ancient days when the west was the domain of the Vikings.Famous sons and daughters of these lands and the achievements they made during their lives both at home and abroad will also be featured.The project is run by the West Highland College UHIrsquos Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research , which was recently awarded a grant worth pound, from the Scottish Natural HeritageNatural and Cultural Heritage Fund.The centre has also secured match funding from the college itself and Caledonian MacBrayne , giving a budget of more than pound,.Sara Bellshaw, senior innovation manager at CRTR, said that it would help prevent folk memories and tales ignored by wider history from being lost forever.She said: ldquoIt is fantastic to have received this funding from the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund and the additional match funding from WHC UHI and CalMac.

But poundbn has already been committed and it is expected that most of the remaining poundbn will be set out in Mr Sunakrsquos first Budget.

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March . All photographs should be taken in a garden or outdoor setting and must have been taken by you.Entries can be emailed to wildbirdcompetition@wearebrazenprcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

One by one, they planted the rough wooden memorials in the grass –  in all – each one marking a le lost to drugs. As they did so, they reflected on the good times, and lamented the waste.The last to plant his cross was Steven Currie. Steven’s older brother Peter McGrattan – known to most as Big Ped – was obsessed by music. “He was into punk when he was a boy, then U, Inspiral Carpets, Stone Roses, Oasis,” says Steven, who has the word “Brother” tattooed on his arm. “He was the man for the music, and you would follow suit because you looked up to him.” Steven would sit on the floor while Peter played DJ. “I’d tap tap my feet and think: ‘That’s quite good, that.’ His taste was superb. He could have been one of those guys that spotted bands.”But Big Ped carried a bit of weight and it affected his self-esteem. He trod that well-worn path from alcohol through soft drugs, heroin and crack cocaine, on to the grave. He died of a Valium overdose, after eight years clean, in August , dying in their mother’s house. “The paramedic came in and said: ‘He’s gone,’” Steven says. “I sat with him on the floor and cuddled him until they came and took him away.” Gone, but still loved still remembered.We are in the grip of a drugs deaths emergency here in Scotland, as everybody knows. Our drugs death rate is the worst in Europe. The toll for  was , – the highest it has ever been. It will come as little surprisethis year’s is higher still. The crosses are a reminder that each of the , was an inidual robbed of their future.En masse, they capture the scale of the problem. Spread out in rows like war graves, they say: “Here is a generation being wiped out, while those at the top play politics.” Is this too harsh  Maybe. Yet even as Steven placed his cross, the UK and Scottish governments were squabbling over rival drugs summits to be held in Glasgow a day apart. “My drugs summit is better than your drugs summit,” they blustered like children.Of course, politicians on both sides can justy their position. The UK government will say it announced its conference first. “But without consulting us, and without including those with lived experience,” the Scottish Government will counter. If either party does not understand how pathetic it sounds – how pathetic it is – for two governments who share responsibility for drugs policy to be unwilling to cut the crap and share a table, I suggest they get out of politics for a while and look at this from beyond the bubble. I suggest they spend some time in those communities where people are losing their lives for want of inter-agency collaboration and a coherent policy.This is not to suggest the Scottish Government is doing nothing. Last year – under pressure, and having previously cut frontline services – it set up the Drugs Deaths Task Force. In the recent budget it announced an extra £.m to be spent on “delivering innovative projects, testing new approaches and developing a national pathway for opiate substitute therapy”.The Scottish Government conference will also provide training in the use of Naloxone, which reverses the effect of drugs overdoses, and a demonstration model of a drugs consumption room. It insists what takes place there will “inform” its contribution to the UK summit the next day. And yet the mutual blame game neither side appears able to stop does not augur well.So often we hear about successful policy where, particularly in Portugal where drugs have been decriminalised, users have been de-stigmatised and those who consume can choose between harm reduction and rehab.But the key to Portugal’s success was not merely the approach itself, but the political consensus that formed around it and an unshakeable commitment to that approach through successive governments.Here in the UK, we are still treating drugs policy like a political football a forum for the airing of grievances a battleground for ideological dferences. This was happening long before the general election, but it is worse now the Tories have a thumping majority.The destructive relationship between Westminster and the Scottish Government – and more specically between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson – is spilling into other areas too, most notably the COP climate conference which will take place in Glasgow in November.This conference is supposed to build the coalition necessary to break the deadlock on international climate action – and therefore requires UK-wide co-operation and a gt for diplomacy.Already, however, it has been reduced to oneupmanship. Despite being advised otherwise, Johnson has refused to give Sturgeon any formal role in proceedings. And there have been disputes over the venue itself. With the conference set to be held in the Scottish Events Campus on the north of the river, the Scottish Government booked out the Science Centre on the south. But now the UK government says it needs both sites and has accused the Scottish Government of trying to undermine its plans. To make matters worse, the Prime Minister is said to have referred to Sturgeon as “that wee Jimmy Krankie woman” to which Sturgeon responded “ Boris Johnson wants to make personal insults against me, I’m a big enough girl to make personal insults back”. All highly constructive.I think most of us accept Johnson would try the patience of a saint. As last week’s reshuffle demonstrated, he – or rather Dominic Cummings – is hell-bent on exercising control. Claire Perry claims he sacked her as the president of the COP and replaced her with former international development secretary Alok Sharma because Whitehall couldn’t cope with an independent conference. Sharma is said to have a questionable record on environment issues.Given all this, it must be tempting to answer criticism by pointing out that “Johnson started this” and that he is a twat of the highest order. But that gets us nowhere. Meanwhile, the planet burns.Aware, presumably, that tit-for-tat fighting is destructive and childish, Sturgeon has called for a reset in relations. But for that to happen, the UK government will not only have to be willing to co-operate on key issues, the Scottish Government will have to stop constantly passing the buck southwards.The constitutional debate is not going to disappear. Both governments will be arguing over the legitimacy of a second independence referendum for some time. But they need to be able to set that argument aside when it comes to shared crises such as drugs deaths and climate change.Only by attempting to find common ground can progress be made. If that requires pride to be swallowed, and teeth to be gritted, then so be it. There are too many crosses already in Springburn too many species already extinct.

We must surely, he added, be witnessing a historical record – a government in crisis after just two months in power.Meanwhile, Labour-supporting commentators lined up to explain the replacement of Javid with, as one columnist described him, the “alarmingly obedient” Rishi Sunak.I’m bound to say that for a man mired in crisis, Johnson appears remarkably relaxed. When he and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, told Javid they wanted his team cleared out and replaced by a new staff of advisers working across both  and  Downing Street, they must have know there was a chance – a good one, at that – that the chancellor wouldn’t wear it. His decision to walk cannot have come as a shock.McDonnell’s description of a government in crisis is, I’m afraid, inaccurate. Rather, what we’re seeing is a Prime Minister fully in control. There is no crisis.In Javid’s eager beaver replacement, Johnson has precisely what he wanted: a compliant chancellor who will do what he desires.Quite why Sunak’s loyalty should be seen as “alarming”, I’m not sure. There is nothing in the rule book of politics that says the sign of a good chancellor is a willingness to defy the prime minister. Was Tony Blair’s Labour government improved by the fact chancellor Gordon Brown spent his every waking moment seething with resentment over his rival’s supremacy  No, it wasn’t, was it  In fact, briefing and counter-briefing by Number  and Treasury sources meant the fractured relationship between prime minister and chancellor frequently got in the way of smooth government. When both men would rather have seen their policy agenda make headlines, their bitter relationship became the focus of media attention.When, finally, Brown realised his ambition of becoming prime minister, he could not change his ways. A man born to plot, Brown soon began undermining his chancellor, Alistair Darling, destroying a professional and personal relationship that had endured for years.David Cameron and George Osborne entered government in  having learned from their predecessors. Relations between Downing Street and the Treasury were good for the first time in a long time.Cameron and Osborne were a team and they always understood the pecking order. Each got what he needed from the relationship.But Johnson has no such partner. The Prime Minister has no political soulmate.This being so, what, exactly is the problem with Johnson wishing to take a firm grip of the Treasury  It is, I think, the sort of thing that might look to voters like strong leadership. Few, I’d wager, now lament the passing of the Javid era.Among Johnson’s immediate priorities is solidying the Conservative vote in areas of England which once ed Labour MPs. The Prime Minister will want to deliver for areas in the Midlands and the North of England which went Tory for the first time in generations. If he does not make good on his promises of regeneration and investment then the PM risks watching those voters drt back to Labour.What Johnson needs, right now, is a chancellor who is completely on board with this agenda. But there is something  beyond the Prime Minister’s desire for a compliant chancellor at play, here. Johnson has just sent a message to every member of his parliamentary party that the rules of the game have changed. His demand is complete loyalty, nothing less.From what McDonnell describes as a crisis will, I think, spring a period of uncommon stability in government. Last year, Johnson won the parliamentary majority he craved. Now, he has stamped his authority on his party in no uncertain terms.This same message came across loudly and clearly in Johnson’s dismissal from his cabinet of former leadership contenders Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey. Leadsom is a popular figure among members of the Tory Party’s Eurosceptic right wing. Johnson’s calculation is that he need not concern himself with the feelings of those members. Javid comes out of the last few days rather well, I think. No chancellor can complain about a demand for loyalty but the order to dismiss his team of advisers was a step too far, one provocation too many.That Javid said no to this suggests he has something about him, after all.In a statement following his resignation, the former chancellor reiterated his support for Johnson. I wonder how long this will last.It is undoubtedly the case that when political parties lose discipline, they lose elections. Look at the SNP. For decades, they did nothing but tear each other apart over the best way in which independence might be achieved. Bitter recrimination was part and parcel of SNP membership. And then Alex Salmond ed as party leader for a second stint and he laid down the bloody law to his colleagues. There was to be no briefing about colleagues, no criticism of government policy, and no public disagreement over any of the party’s positions.What followed was as period of unity in the SNP ranks that continues – the occasional domestic disturbance, aside – to this day.I’m not sure Johnson is behaving especially dferently to the way Salmond did. Doubtless, opposition parties will taunt Chancellor Rishi Sunak when he next rises to speak in the House of Commons. They will leave him in no doubt that they consider him a poodle.But each and every one of Boris Johnson’s opponents will privately admire the way he strengthened his grip on the Tory Party last week.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"it s nessie mystery skeleton washed up on scots beach leads to speculation it s loch ness monster","story":"The photos of the rotten carcass on Balmedie Beach in Aberdeen were posted on a local community Facebook page - Fubar News - after it was revealed following the powerful storm which battered the country last week.

The picturesque village sits on the Rhins of Galloway, the name given to the distinctive hammerhead peninsula on the southwest edge of the country.On paper, the distance from here to Larne seems trling. Just over  miles separate Portpatrick from Northern Ireland. Bridges have successfully spanned greater distances in many other parts of the world.But those crossings didn’t have to deal with the terrying depths and changeable weather that seafarers in this remote corner of Scotland know only too well.“I’ve worked offshore for  years, and I would rather face the North Sea on a bad night than the North Channel,” says Calum Currie, who helped lead the local buy-out of Portpatrick’s harbour in .It’s a Thursday afternoon and, by Wigtownshire’s bracing standards, a fairly calm February day. The sun is dazzlingly bright and the wind, while noticeable, isn’t strong enough to blow you off the pier.“See that red sandstone block ” Currie points at a colossal stone which sits incongruously on the breakwater. “That weighs around six tonnes. The waves can pick those up and hurl them over the harbour wall. In winter, the swell in the harbour can reach eight feet.”: Red tape threatens to strangle Boris Johnson’s ‘vanity project’The North Channel offers regular reminders of its awesome power. During exceptionally bad weather in December , passengers aboard a PO ferry bound for Cairnryan feared they were going under when the boat suddenly lurched downwards – toppling articulated lorries like dominos in the process. It is across such waters that Boris Johnson hopes a bridge can finally be built. Civil servants have been asked to come up with a workable plan for a seemingly impossible challenge.Residents in the Rhins of Galloway are being asked by the UK government to think big. Instead, they’re more likely to shrug. The Prime Minister’s grand plan is merely the latest contribution to a debate that has spanned four centuries.“It seems a wee bit fancul,” is the assessment of June Hoad, chair of Portpatrick community council, who has lived in the area all her le.“It would be nicewe were to be consulted in all of this. So far we have heard nothing.”The question of how best to cross from Scotland to Ireland is one that has never been definitively answered.Some of the greatest engineering minds of the modern era were determined that Portpatrick was the solution.John Smeaton, the man hailed as the father of civil engineering, set about in the late th century to make the village a suitable port for regular mail packet sailings to and from the Emerald Isle. He proposed two breakwaters to enclose and protect the village bay. But efforts to construct a northern breakwater failed as a result of the destructive powers of the sea and were abandoned in .John Rennie expanded on Smeaton’s ideas in . A new south breakwater and lighthouse were dutully completed by  – only for a storm to undermine the pier head just three years later. Work on the unfinished northern breakwater was soon abandoned.By  both the mail boats and ferry services had switched from Portpatrick to Stranraer, which sits in the sheltered waters of Loch Ryan.Fast forward to  and Stena Line quit Stranraer to open a new deep water port in Cairnryan, six miles up the coast – a decision the company insisted was necessary to cut costs and reduce crossing times.But few people seem satisfied with the current arrangements, which see both PO and Stena Line operate from two separate terminals.For  years passengers could alight from the train at Stranraer and kill time in its many pubs or hotels before boarding the ferry. Irish banknotes were accepted by many local businesses. Now the town’s east pier and its vast lorry park, formerly home to Stena Line, stand empty – a visual reminder of Stranraer’s diminished status.The current ferry terminals in Cairnryan are grim, utilitarian efforts with few amenities for passengers.There is no rail link to either dock. The thousands of HGVs that use the ferries must navigate the A, which runs south from Ayr, or the A, which runs east from Dumfries.These roads do not resemble vital economic links between two nations.It is dficult to describe the depth of unhappiness the A and A cause the residents of Wigtownshire. Only the A to Inverness – which is now being dualled at fantastic cost – can rival their claim to be the most despised trunk roads in the country.The condition of the roads don’t just affect iniduals – it hurts the economy as well.Stena Line, PO and the Belfast harbour authorities last year collectively called on Transport Scotland to upgrade the A and A to dual carriageway as a matter of priority. The trio said such an investment was required to prevent loss of business to better connected ports in England and Wales.Transport bosses responded that they had already invested heavily in both routes and ruled out making them dual carriageway along their entire .“I’d like to see Boris Johnson drive here without being chauffeured,” says Carly MacDougall, a member of Portpatrick community council, when the subject of his bridge proposal is raised.Residents in the village have lost loved ones who could not be transferred in time from Stranraer’s small hospital to better equipped facilities in Glasgow.Locals joke that more babies are born on the road to Dumfries than in the town’s maternity unit itself. Speak to anyone in Portpatrick or Stranraer about the possibility of a bridge to Ireland and the conversation soon s to one crucial question: how can they even think about such a project when the existing roads are so bad The region’s poor connectivity is an issue the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press has asked again and again over the years.It is one of the few weekly newspapers in Scotland not to have fallen into the hands of the big media conglomerates, and unlike many other local titles, retains a visible presence in the centre of the town it serves.Jenner Jones recently moved from Glasgow to Portpatrick after taking up a job as a reporter on the paper. While greatly enjoying her new le, she admits the condition of roads in the area leave a lot to be desired.“There is a delicate balance,” she said. “It’s a great tourist attraction. People love it down here because it feels empty.“But you look our through archives and the same arguments were being made  years ago.“MSPs all say the same things regardless of political party. They promote the region – but it feels too easy to ignore it.”John Cooper, a veteran newspaperman, agrees. He was brought up in Stranraer and ed to take charge of his hometown newspaper last year.“It is a dferent world down here,” he says. “People talk about it being ‘the forgotten corner’ of Scotland. It’s almost like an island.“Stranraer has been promised so much over the years that talk of a bridge just washes over people.“Every party has struggled with the transport issues down here over the decades – and in the end nothing gets done.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"labour leadership contest exposes glaring rift on response to scottish independence debate","story":"Labour isions over the prospect of a second referendum on independence were laid bare as the candidates vying for the UK leadership and its deputy role clashed in Glasgow yesterday.Frontrunners Sir Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey appeared split over the constitution. The former pledged not to impose policy from London on the Scottish party, while Long-Bailey made it clear she would grant a second referendum on independencethis was requested by the Scottish Parliament.Scottish party leader Richard Leonard had earlier warned that future policy on the constitution must be made north of the border.Long-Bailey insisted Labour would never rejoin a cross-party Better Together-style body in the event of a future referendum – prompting an angry rebuff from the party’s only Scottish MP for “trashing” the victorious  pro-Union campaign.Labour’s new leader and deputy leader will be unveiled on  April. Yesterday the three leadership candidates, including Lisa Nandy, faced off in a hustings event at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.Independence featured heavily as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon demands the right to hold a second referendum on independence after the SNP’s landslide election victory north of the border in December.Starmer insisted he will work with the party in Scotland. “There won’t be any imposition from London, I’ll be working with Scottish Labour.”He said whether or not Holyrood should have the power to stage a fresh ballot on the issue was “an interesting question”, but added: “We shouldn’t get sucked straight into that.“The SNP are constantly using the constitutional issue to mask the real issues, andwe get into that we are falling into their trap.”Leonard had earlier warned, in what he described as his “abiding message” to the UK leadership hopefuls, that the position on a second referendum must be settled north of the border.“The policy of this Labour party on Scotland’s constitutional future must be written here in Scotland by a Scottish Labour Party and written by us alone.”But Long-Bailey again made it clear that she would not block a second independence referendumthis was requested by the Scottish Parliament, warning such a barrier would drive voters “into the arms of the SNP”.“As a democrat I have to say thatthe Scottish Parliament makes the request for a referendum I don’t believe that as a democratic party we could refuse that,” she said.The pro-independence SNP-Greens majority at Holyrood voted in favour of a second referendum last month.And in a move which appeared to cut across the autonomy of Scottish Labour, Long-Bailey added: “We can’t fall into the trap like we did last time where we joined forces with the Conservative party in the Better Together campaign. “Nicola Sturgeon wants to paint us as a party of the establishment and we’re not.”She was backed by deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon, who said it would be “counterproductive” for a UK government to intervene.“If the Scottish people desire another independence referendum then Westminster shouldn’t block it,” he said.He added that sharing a  with the Tories in Better Together saw Labour come across as part of the establishment which has left a “damaging electoral legacy”.None the less, both Burgon and Long-Bailey insisted they were opposed to independence and would campaign against it.Scottish Labour’s position on the constitution had previously been marked by its opposition to another referendum. But this was thrown into disarray last summer when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced during a trip to the Edinburgh festival thatJeremy Corbyn was prime minister, his government would not block a second referendum on independencethis was requested by the Scottish Parliament.But Ian Murray, member for Edinburgh South, and the only Labour MP in Scotland to survive Labour’s dismal election performance last December, dismissed this approach on the constitutional debate and pointed out that the SNP won less than halfof the popular vote in the election.“Let’s stop dancing to the tune of our opponents,” said Murray.“There’s no mandate for a second referendum –  per cent is not a mandate.”“And secondly, let’s never have a senior member of the Labour party come to Scotland during a UK general election and throw the Scottish Labour Party under a bus.”He insisted that Labour must be clear in its opposition to both independence and a second referendum and warned against the “extreme nationalism” being proposed by the SNP as Scotland prepares for the Holyrood elections next year.He added: “We will never win in  unless we are strong on the constitution, and being strong on that constitution starts with not trashing our record in government over  years, and second, not trashing the way we saved the country in .”Murray campaigned on behalf of the Better Together campaign in the  election.The referendum issue has split Labour in Scotland, with senior figures like health spokeswoman Monica Lennon claiming Holyrood should be allowed to decide on the issue after the SNP’s election victory in Scotland.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch dramatic footage shows ferry caught in storm dennis","story":"A ferry swaying heavily at sea as storm Dennis batters parts of the country has been caught on camera.Stuart Bell was visiting the Isle of Arran when he filmed the ferry approaching the Calmac Ferry Terminal.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It’s time they packed up and disbanded.”Ms O’Neill and Mr Kelly’s attendance at a PSNI recruitment event was hailed by Chief Constable Simon Byrne as “seismic and historic”.It was the first time such a senior Sinn Fein figure had attended such a meeting, although the party has expressed support for police in Northern Ireland on many occasions in the past.Last year there were attempted bomb attacks by dissident republicans targeting police in Belfast, Craigavon in Co Armagh and near the Irish border in Fermanagh.The New IRA and Continuity IRA are involved.Police have branded as “cruel and disgusting” anti-PSNI recruitment posters depicting an officer who was severely injured in a bomb attack.The posters used a picture of Peadar Heffron along with a warning that anyone thinking of joining the police could suffer similar injuries.Mr Heffron lost a leg when a dissident bomb detonated under his car near Randalstown in  as he travelled to work. He now uses a wheelchair.Meanwhile, Ms McDonald commended her negotiating, Executive and Assembly teams – led by Ms O’Neill – for “working hard for citizens”.She listed recent successes following the restoration of devolved political powersharing at Stormont.The party leader said: “Already in the Executive we have seen measures taken to tackle poverty, including moving quickly to end the nurses dispute of equal pay extending welfare mitigations, a new house building programme has been announced.“Additional funding has been made available for education and the victims and survivors of the contaminated blood scandal in the north will receive compensation payments.”PA,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadValentine#s Day calf born with heart-shaped patch in Co AntrimTributes to Arnie Clarke who drowned in desperate bid to save dog in Co Down riverNorthern Ireland councils in debt to tune of £m as some ratepayers face raft of cuts to servicesNorthern Ireland school principal working with police after #vicious# lies about staff and pupils posted onlineBelfast fraudster Mackie back behind bars after thefts from church and charity,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It did not field enough candidates to fully capitalise on a wave of support inspired by discontent over problems in the health service and access to housing.Ms McDonald said: “The political establishment of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are circling the wagons in defence of a status quo that will not deliver the change citizens voted for last weekend.”She addressed a party meeting in Belfast on Saturday.Sinn Fein topped the first preference poll following the General Election.Its total of  seats is one fewer than that of Fianna Fail.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s Fine Gael won  seats.Sinn FÃ©in Cuige AGM Matt Carthy TD introducing meet: https:t.co VSdcuQXjH— Gerry AdamsFebruary , No single party has enough seats to govern and Sinn Fein appears to have failed to muster enough support from a coalition of small left-leaning parties and independent members of the new Irish Parliament, the Dail.Ms McDonald said the public had given her party a chance to show it can improve their lives.“A chance to show that will we honour our commitments.“A chance to shape a government that will finally do right by ordinary people.“They want a government for change.”It now seems that Micheal Martin#s plan is to deny the people what they voted forMary Lou McDonaldShe said that was why Fianna Fail and Fine Gael were – and are – so determined to keep Sinn Fein out of government.“Because they don’t want change.“That is why they said they wouldn’t talk to us.“And it now seems that Micheal Martin’s plan is to deny the people what they voted for.“That is an arrogant and untenable position, given the strength of Sinn Fein’s mandate.”Meanwhile, the Labour Party met in Dublin to discuss the contest for a new leader.Outgoing chief Brendan Howlin has said he will not put himself forward as a candidate for speaker of the Dail parliament, the Ceann Comhairle, to replace a Fianna Fail incumbent in the role.Mr Howlin told the : “The position of Ceann Comhairle is a very important one in the House, one I have enormous respect for, but it is not one that I intend to offer myself as a candidate to fill.”PARelated Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ffa-ff-b-bba-caeebcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ffa-ff-b-bba-caeebcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ffa-ff-b-bba-caeebcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ffa-ff-b-bba-caeebcf_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ffa-ff-b-bba-caeebcf_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandSinn Fein leader hits out at ‘old boys’ club’ of Fianna Fail and Fine GaelSinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald has criticised what she described as the “old boys’ club of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael” as they have both refused to enter government talks with her party.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-f-f-ad-bdbccd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-f-f-ad-bdbccd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-f-f-ad-bdbccd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-f-f-ad-bdbccd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-f-f-ad-bdbccd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandSinn Fein TD: Not possible to form government without Fine Gael or Fianna FailA Sinn Fein TD has said it will be impossible for the party to form a coalition government without the support of either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most Read‘Arrogant’ rivals don’t want change, says Sinn Fein leaderIRA#s #Surgeon# Sean Hughes asked to mend Sinn Fein splitAt a glance: Northern Ireland’s  General Election winners and losersSinn Fein#s Mary Lou McDonald tipped to succeed Gerry Adams as leader of Sinn FeinJacqui Smith rues porn film expense claim,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of the pupils at Ballougry PS have a family link to the school and children come from as far afield as Eglinton and Donemana to be educated there.We have children whose parents, grandparents and even great grandparents have been at the school.The parents have such fond memories of their time here that they want their children to enjoy the same type of education, no matter where they are living.Mr OKane believes that attending a small primary school equips children well for the transition to secondary school.In a small school setting you have to get on well with everyone and the children thrive on it.In bigger schools you can jump around friendship groupsthings arent working out, but here you just have to work it out.We were very happy with out recent transfer test results and our children will be moving on to every post primary school in the city.”Mr OKane concluded: The feedback that we always get is that the children really do represent us well.Among the schools best known past pupils is renowned actress, Amanda Burton, well known for her television roles, including Heather Black in the Channel  soap opera Brookside, Beth Glover in Peak Practice, Sam Ryan in the BBC crime drama series Silent Witness, Clare Blake in The Commander and Karen Fisher in Waterloo Road.Her father was a headmaster at the school. googletag.cmd.push Photos: Tom Heaney   googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an ‘Embrace the Giant Spirit’ event organised by Tourism NI, actors Stephen Rea, Tara Lynne O’Neill and Laurence Kinlan, musician Neil Martin and the singer-songwriter Lisa Hannigan, gave a unique and moving performance to celebrate Seamus Heaney’s work at Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin.The programme was curated by Seamus Heaney HomePlace, the literary centre in Bellaghy, Co Derry, which takes visitors on a journey through the le and literature of the poet, with an invited audience including members of the Heaney family, representatives from the local tourism industry as well as arts, culture and media.The performers came together as part of an initiative which aims to highlight the literary connections between Seamus Heaney HomePlace, which recently reached its , visitor milestone, and the hugely successful ‘Listen Now Again’ exhibition, which draws on the National Library’s extensive Heaney archive and has welcomed over , visitors since it opened in Dublin in July .Featuring powerful performances of Seamus Heaney’s work, including an adaptation in words and music of an excerpt of Aeneid: Book VI and a haunting performance of Anahorish by Lisa Hannigan, the event comes as HomePlace prepares to extend its visitor experience into the landscape which so inspired the poet and which features in his work.A total of  locations of signicance to Seamus Heaney are being developed, notable among them being Lough Beg a place of ‘special memories’ for the poet where a boardwalk will lead visitors to a newly constructed viewing point to see Church Island and its famous spire, with extracts of poetry audible, as well as visible along the route. A riverside walk by the Moyola River is also being created and a newly commissioned sculpture will form the focal point for visitors to hear and read poetry at the eel fishery in Toome. Visitors will also be able to download an app, which will allow access to augmented reality as they journey through each location.Fiona Cunningham, RoI Market Manager for Tourism NI said, “With the impressive Seamus Heaney HomePlace, situated in Bellaghy, only two and a half hours from Dublin, visitors can really immerse themselves in our greatest poet’s writing and discover many areas of his beloved hometown that inspired so much of his work.“Over , thousand have visited the Dublin exhibition since it opened in , and many may be unaware of the very unique and spiritually moving experience one can also get when visiting Heaney HomePlace. Visitors are coming from all over the world to soak up the beautul place, people and landscapes in Northern Ireland that inspired him so much and we want to encourage people from across Ireland to make the unforgettable trip to follow his journey, walk the paths he took and explore through his words at Seamus Heaney HomePlace. We are really inviting you to embrace our giant spirit in NI and to awaken your own.”HomePlace also recently opened its new Tourism NI approved Visitor Information Centre, offering a range of new services for visitors to learn about further immersive activities, places to visit and stay in the area. Chris Heaney, son of Seamus Heaney, said: “It’s a pleasure to be here this evening to celebrate Seamus Heaney HomePlace and to highlight its outstanding events programme of readings, concerts and performances”.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Martin Kearney, commented, “We in Bellaghy and Dublin share our custodianship of a signicant legacy and this evening HomePlace has been very pleased to be curating here, sharing also a taste of the experience our visitors have in our performance space.“We hope that we will continue, inidually and collectively, to celebrate all our writers and the great literary talent which has emerged from this island. There is a momentum building across Ireland and an opportunity for us to create a cultural tourism network across the entire landscape, North to South, East to West, where we and our visitors can embrace a ‘giant literary spirit’”.Brian McCormick, manager of HomePlace said: “We want to extend our sincere thanks to Tourism NI for hosting such a special evening and for continuing to highlight the incredible opportunities there are, through HomePlace and Listen Now Again, for visitors to engage with and be inspired by Seamus Heaney and his work”. The latest Seamus Heaney-related investment is valued at over pound,, with % funding from DAERA and the remainder from Mid Ulster District Council which owns and operates Seamus Heaney HomePlace.To book your short break to Northern Ireland visit: www.discovernorthernireland googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That feeling of love and happiness between the three of us was just perfect. This led to a conversation between my son and I, and later his girlfriend and his dad, about what holding hands means, about the memories it provokes and how we hold hands.How we hold hands  I hear you ask, don’t we all hold hands the same  Well I thought we did but no we don’t. . There’s the palm together hand hold, the fingers entwined hand hold, the just fingertips entwined hand hold and there are more. Which one you are, my son told me, depends on who you are holding hands with! Well I disagreed I always hold hands in a palms together way - but apparently that’s just a mummy hold according to my son!. Yes, his dad disagreed, but my son’s girlfriend didn’t.So, what does holding hands mean, what does it make us think, what does it make us feel and remember  George was smiling as he remembered his grandad holding his wrist - yes, his wrist not his hand - to cross the road. George said he really didn’t like this as he was about eight years old at the time but he does remember letting his grandad do it because he thought it made his grandad happy. His dad laughed when George said this and told George his grandad did the same to him – hmmm, I wonder, will this become a family tradition  I remember holding hands with my mum lots of times, but most of all I remember her sliding her little finger up my wrist as she held my hand and that this would make us both laugh together. My son’s girlfriend said, although she remembered holding hands with her mum, she also remembered always holding hands with her best friend everywhere they went. Personally, I can remember telling my son that he had to hold my hand when we were out so I didn’t get lost - great excuse to keep him safe. I had this same “holding hands” conversation later that week with my friend who told me she loved holding hands with her little one as they sing row your boat and with her older child who loves to walk on the walls in front of people’s houses. I think a favourite of mine, apart from that with my son nieces and mum, of course , is when I am in school or nursery and I see all the children holding hands with mum or dadchattering away and smiling together. I’m smiling as I’m writing remembering all these things - I know you’ll have your own happy hand holding memories too. It’s a simple gesture but does show how much we care, how much we love, does send a message of caring through touch, does support a loving bond, can help us feel, and give, security and a feeling of belonging to each other. googletag.cmd.push But, as our babies, toddlers and children grow into pre-teens the hand holding begins to disappear - unless you are lucky enough to have an affectionate teenage daughter.So, enjoy it today, remember the feeling of those little hands in yours, take time to hold hands together whether walking along, sitting and watching tv or singing a simple rhyme. For these memories will take you through the stroppy teenage years - teenage years wherein their idea of holding hands with you in public is just the most embarrassing thing ever, and all the way to Grandparent days!!!Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Local council officials say that they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site.They hope that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what residents and traders would like to see and what would work at this particular site.The development brief for the town centre location is expected to outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon has welcomed confirmation that a so-called soft market testing exercise is to proceed shortly.ldquoThis will allow potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to visit the Irish Street site during a planned open day. This will allow them to give their views on the potential of the site and point out any likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe feedback provided will be used to assist the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to prepare a development brief for the site.ldquoThe regeneration project for the former police base site provides an opportunity to regenerate Downpatrick town centre.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs. She said this not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town.Cllr Mason said that housing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site.She added: ldquoThe bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road. The new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that Ms Mallon will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.He said: ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch, but the wider South Down area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12th February 2020 New Queens.jpg","title":"New queens of Ulster  ","story":"ST Maryrsquos High School, Downpatrick, lted the prestigious Erne Cup for the first time at the Mid Ulster Sports Arena, Cookstown, last Wednesday afternoon with a blistering display of attacking football.Victory was no more than the local girls deserved when they gained revenge for last seasonrsquos heartbreaking cup final defeat to the same opposition.St Maryrsquos started the game strongly and turned their possession into scores with an early goal from Saulrsquos Cara Doran settling the nerves.The Enniskillen girls were simply not allowed to play their vaunted expansive game and Katie Convie raced in almost immediately to make it - to - when she capitalised on a poor kick-out.St Fanchearsquos had no intention of giving up their title without a fight and replied with three consecutive points.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

The clear message from voters of all parties was that our Province could not continue to drt after three years without local decisions on everyday issues like our roads, schools and hospitals.By Arlene Foster, First MinisterSaturday, th February , : am\"\"Arlene FosterAlthough the New Decade New Approach deal is not perfect it was fair and balanced. We should take the elements about respecting each other’s identity and use it as the vehicle for promoting a vibrant and prosperous Northern Ireland, as an active and integral and part of the UK, as we approach the centenary of the place we are proud to call home.Those pretending that the political vacuum of the last three years was in Unionism’s best interests offer only a short-sighted strategy. That is not the position of the DUP. The reality is that people living in every part of Northern Ireland whatever their political outlook, want delivery of effective frontline services, not the ision of a border poll or distraction of recycling the Brexit debate. Despite some of the spin, the  RTE exit poll showed almost one in five of SF voters didn’t even support a border poll. Instead % prioritised healthcare.We should not be complacent in defending and promoting the overwhelming benefits of being part of the UK. However we should not lose sight of the fact that the best defence against those who wish to take us out of the UK is to create a socially thriving and economically prosperous Northern Ireland. A Northern Ireland where everyone feels at home and where everywhere has a genuine and active stake in determining their future. Despite its accepted weaknesses and frustrations, devolution is still the key to this. Yesterday I attended a business breakfast in the Castlereagh Hills. There I presented my vision of making our Province a better place to live, work, grow up, raise a family and do business. That means building a dynamic and successful regional economy. Protecting first and foremost unfettered access for trade with Great Britain, in both directions, and ensuring local interests are met in the implementation of Brexit. It means pursuing better infrastructure connections both with Great Britain and between dferent hubs of jobs and growth within Northern Ireland. This will increase the number of households seeing practical benefits of living their lives within the fth largest global economy.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It is also our job to incentivise young people to stay in Northern Ireland as part of a skilled and future-proof workforce. It is not in the wider interests of unionism to allow the brain drain to continue. We are committed to working with domestic and international businesses to identy skills gaps and create better links between education routes at all levels and the needs of employers not just tomorrow but in five or ten years’ time. All the while ensuring affected sectors like agri-food and hospitality have access to the outside labour they need in the short-term. At the same time we have to showcase Northern Ireland, building on the strong tourism brand already established. Earlier this week the Tourism NI’s Visitor Attitude Survey reported that % of visitors to Causeway Coast and Glens thought it met or exceeded expectations. The future for Northern Ireland as a positive brand is bright. The possibilities are limitless and we will work proactively with the newly appointed Cabinet Minister for the Constitution and Devolution to make even further strides.Last year the DUP began work on developing a “Next Generation Unionism” approach. This work continues and we must seek to be pro-active in developing our case rather and building the broadest possible support. I am clear that restoring Stormont isn’t a barrier to a vibrant and forward-looking brand of Unionism. It presents a fresh impetus that we must be ambitious to exploit. The road will not always be easy. There will be challenges. However this is how we will protect the interests of unionism and secure Northern Ireland’s place for the next  years. We all have a role to play in this process and I look forward to getting started.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

So we had plenty of other things to think about and not just her position on our right to stand.Most speakers at the meeting spoke in support of Rebecca Long-Bailey yet they were unable to convince many of the rest of us to swing our support behind Rebecca.Thornberry’s letter to us did not come out of the blue but was a response to a question asked of all leadership candidates.She had replied in the same manner to a similar question raised by the Labour Party Irish Society, so she adopted a consistent position throughout. She saw the fairnessof our case but that ultimately moving on it would depend on other things happening.Of course it is possible that her response was tailored by the fact that she needed our nomination.This possibility was forcefully raised at the meeting so we were all aware of that possibility.

It’s a conversational well that is unlikely to run dry given the numerous prompts that adorn the walls, the rails and the display counters.Northern Ireland might not be as big a force in world football as the likes of Germany, France and Brazil, but per capita the Province punches well above its weight in terms of a fanaticism for football, be it the Irish League, the national team or an adopted team in England or Scotland.Mugs featuring the Irish Leagues finest: Glenn Ferguson, Gregg Davidson, Chris Walker, Billy Caskey, Jamie Mulgrew, Joe Gormley and George McMullan \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The shop which was opened in August by Ryan Gilmore, , and his business partner Pete McDonald, , taps into the rich demand for memorabilia amongst the nation’s football mad population.It leans towards the local game, celebrating the old kits and legendary stars of the Irish league, and immortalising national heroes such as Best, Whiteside, Jennings and more latterly Evans, McAuley and Healy. Ryan explained how a friendship forged in football gave birth to what is believed to be the only dedicated retro football shop in Northern Ireland.He said: “Pete and I are both Bangor fans – that’s a real labour of love – but we didn’t know each other until we met through work. We worked together for years in Yell where we pretty much talked about football non-stop.A Linfield shirt from  “The idea to start selling shirts online came after I’d been over to watch the Frampton fightand I went to the Classic Football Shirts Shop in Manchester. It’s  times bigger than the shop we have here.“I was with my fiancee at the time, now my we, and I said to her I’m going to try and do something like this online. I know how to do marketing, I love football, social media is easy enough when you know what you’re doing so I thought, I’ll give it a go. She didn’t object so that was a good start.“I started doing the shirts online last December. I got a bit of traction so I applied for a stall at St George’s in December and again in August.“I was getting married in July so I probably should have only been concentrating on that and nothing , but then I found out this unit in Smithfield was available. The Northern Ireland Subbeteo print is the top seller“Just before I was getting married – I think it was only a couple of days – I signed for the unit. Just before we got married I had to break the news to my we that I now owned a shop.“Around that time I spoke to Pete about coming on board. He said, ‘you don’t know what you’re doing, I don’t know what I’m doing, let’s see what we can do together’.”Askedthe dynamic changes when something you love becomes your job, Pete said: “I could never see us getting bored of it, I think I’ll forever be in that bubble, it’s something I love. “People work in office jobs and talk about football all day, that’s what we were like. Now we’ve got a set up where we can talk about football to whoever comes in and it’s part of the job.”Some of retro kit coasters for saleRyan commented: “On the business side of things we’re talking to clubs, striking up partnerships with other companies. Everything revolves around a love of football.”Pete said: “It’s good getting into the business side of it. There’s a buzz that comes from speaking to commercial managers of football clubs, trying to strike up partnerships.“It’s really easy to speak to people over here, quite a few clubs have heard of us.”He continued: “We’ve four clubs from the Irish League we’re in partnership with – Portadown, Linfield, Glentoran and Cltonville – and we’re branching across into England too.”At the moment the NI Classic Shirt Co is a part time venture, with the shop open on Thursday afternoonsand Fridays and Saturdays from . to .pm.Pete said: “We’re hoping to get full time. We’re going after clubs in England, Scotland and the League of Ireland as well as more local clubs. If they put in orders of a lot of units that can allow us to get a regular income and go full time.The interior of the shop in Smithfield market“We want to do as much Irish League stuff as we can with every club, that’s including the Championship. It would be great to get everyone on board. We’ve got a concept that can work with any club in the world.”Some of the shop’s best selling items are art prints of Subbuteo players from the Irish League or national team in kits from the eras in which they played. Another popular line sees a selection of classic kits displayed on coasters, mugs, T-shirts and art prints.And for those who like memorabilia they can wear the shop has a great range of old shirts, some match-worn.The strike partners leading the retro football revolution in Northern Ireland talked about some of their key team mates in their bid to climb the commercial ladder.Ryan said: “Tom Woodsdoes the Subbuteo prints. I approached him way back in the summer. I saw what he was doing with teams all over the UK. I commissioned him to do the Northern Ireland one which is a fantastic seller for us. “It’s kits from ious eras worn by  of the best ever players – there’s nothing like this available anywhere .“For the Subbuteo designs the club sends us photos of the players, we send them onto Tom and he works his magic. “We’ve also got him to do some Irish Leagues teams that we’ve teamed up with.” Pete continued: “With Hally Designs, they produce artwork featuring classic kits and you can turn them into prints or coasters or mugs or T-shirts. “They also do art prints of classic moments like when we beat England -. “We persuaded them to branch into the Irish League.”Ryan said: “There’s always new ideas out there, new brands to team up with.”In one of the framed prints by Hally Designs I spot the dubious yellow Broomhill kit which Glenavon wore in . It’s a kit I still own, but can’t recall wearing this side of the millennium.“Some of the worst kits are the best loved,” commented Ryan. “Some of them are an acquired taste. The fans love the Cltonville Kit Kat kit, we keep selling out of that on the coasters.”As well as the bespoke printed items, the shop is home to an array of old football programmes and some rare football shirts.Pete, an Arsenal fan, is particularly proud the shop has recently acquired the club’s yellow and blue ‘bruised banana’ away kit from - as well as a ‘Bergkamp ’ Holland shirt from .He said: “Bergkamp was the top man for me. It’ll pain me to sell those shirts but that’s how a business works.”Ryan said: “When I say we get shirts from all over the world I’m not trying to be vague, they genuinely come from all over the world. “There’s a Linfield top in there I got from Hong Kong. We’ve worked with collectors in Thailand, we’ve got stuff from America. “We get stuff locally as well, for example we sold a ‘ Red Star Belgrade top that had belonged to a guy who lived just outside Belfast. It was bought by someone in Miami, Florida. That shirt has done some miles.“There’s a Rangers match-worn Alex Cleland in there with number two on the back. It came from a collector in Asia.“We do get requests from people looking for specic shirts. There’s a network of collectors you can put a message out to and see what people have.”Of the resurgence in the Irish League that has helped boost the sales of memorabilia, Pete said: “We’re finding a lot of people are coming back to Glentoran and there’s been a big cash injection at Larne. “Some matches are on BBC, some on Sky Sports. You are getting good crowds again, it’s coming back.“Just last week we sold a the Glentoran home kit from - by auction for £. I reckon it would have cost about £ to £ at the time.“The Irish League is our bread and butter, but we want to branch out into the lower leagues in England and Scotland. “We’d especially love to get our own club Bangor on board. There’s a big fanbase still there.”Ryan said: “We’ve spoken to a few Irish League players on Twitter – we’ve got feedback from Joe Gormley and Liam Boyce, they both like their versions on the Cltonville Subbuteo print.”Ryan continued: “We don’t come from a retail background, we’re just football fans.“Initially I was just emailing every address I could find, pitching to them and explaining what I was trying to do. Now we’re speaking to clubs on the phone.“Obviously George Best put Northern Ireland on the map but recently with us doing well in the Euros people are paying attention outside of here.”While the online shop is rising in prominence the lads are trying to spread the word that they have a physical shop in Smithfield as well. “So many people come in to the shop and say they didn’t know we were here,” said Ryan. “Now they’re coming once a month to see what new things we’ve got in. Word of mouth for us is massive, customers telling their friends.“In most sports shops in Northern Ireland you can only get the most recent kits from the main Premier League, European and Scottish teams. We’re trying to offer something a bit dferent.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
