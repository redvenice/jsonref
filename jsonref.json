Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears. He said, “They will eat you alive.” He was right.’    Prince Harry (pictured) called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suitInstead of taking Harry’s advice, Mr Markle made a secret arrangement to pose for a series of pictures – a decision he now bitterly regrets. The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it. I’m done.’Kensington Palace declined to comment last night.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/00/4F07D26C00000578-0-image-m-3_1534031085707.jpg","title":"Bruce Forsyths family want store ashes stage London Palladium","story":"Father of Love Island winner Jack Fincham is a convicted...The purrrrrrfect job!

The new exams aim to bring performance in line with countries in Asia which are much higher than the UK in the international league tablesCath Jadhav, a director of standards at Ofqual, revealed its grading strategy for this year in a series of blog posts. She said: \u0027Student performance dips a little in the first years of a new qualification, because teachers are less familiar with the new specifications, and there are fewer support materials and past papers for students to use.\u0027Using statistics compensates for that dip, so that the 2018 cohort is not unfairly disadvantaged by being the first to sit these new qualifications.\u0027She said the results of the new A-levels will \u0027look similar\u0027 to last year, providing only that the \u0027ability make-up\u0027 of pupils has not changed. This means a similar proportion of entries – 26 per cent – will get an A or A*, while three quarters will be graded C or above.At GCSE the proportion of entries previously getting a C or above – two thirds – will be graded 4 or above this year.The bottom of grade 7 is equivalent to the bottom of the old A, and as before, 20 per cent should achieve this or above. Within this sub-group around 20 per cent again will get the top grade of 9.This means the 9 grade – which Oxford and Cambridge will use to identify the very brightest pupils – will be much harder to get than the old A*. However, some teachers are still worried the volatility of the reforms could mean pupils miss out on the results they deserve.The changes were brought in partly because leading universities had complained pupils were arriving poorly prepared for the demands of degrees.They also said they found it difficult to choose between thousands of applicants who had achieved straight As and A*s at GCSE and were predicted top grades at A-level as well.A-level results come out on Thursday and GCSE results are out on August 23."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/21/12C7F7F3000005DC-0-image-m-19_1534105366490.jpg","title":"The Meg brought army megalodon believers murky depths social media","story":"    An army of \u0027megalodon believers\u0027 have come out in full force on social media after the release of The Meg (pictured, a scene from the film)Of course, if this movie were more true to life, the characters playing scientists would surely be set on safeguarding any creature that had survived millennia for the purposes of research.Indeed, that is the conspiracy theory nurtured by the legion of \u0027megalodon believers\u0027 who have emerged on social media, in chat rooms and on forums, since the film opened.Girl, 3, is attacked by a fox that snuck into her house as...Gardener, 65, spends three and a half hours a DAY watering...Share this articleReal scientists, they say, refuse to admit these sharks are still out there because if their existence were known, they would be hunted into proper extinction.So, could a killer shark three times as big as the biggest great white be lurking in the deepest depths and devouring prey, including seals, other sharks and whales, with its razor-sharp 6 in teeth? Before we tackle that question, let\u0027s assess what we know about megalodon.The name means \u0027large tooth\u0027 and it\u0027s true that only a titanically huge shark could accommodate 270 of them in its gaping mouth. Experts at the Natural History Museum estimate that its bite would  9 ft by 11 ft — enough to swallow a family car.          A tooth belonging to the extinct megalodon shark (left) compared to that of a great white (right) The creatures are thought to have become extinct some two to three million years ago, due to climate change, a decline in prey, the advent of rival predators such as killer whales, or a combination of all three.However, over the past century, a series of alarming sightings by seafarers has fostered the tantalising idea that surviving megalodon may still inhabit the darkest corners of our oceans.Back in 1918, David Stead, an Australian naturalist, reported how local fishermen were refusing to venture back out to sea after a 100 ft-long pure white shark had demolished their gear and taken their catch.And as recently as 2012, shark researchers interviewed a group of South African fisherman who claimed a huge shark, at least as big as their 40 ft-long boat, was terrorising their area.As for physical evidence, a deep-sea dredging expedition in 1875 by the Royal Navy corvette HMS Challenger pulled up a pair of megalodon teeth near Tahiti. Some of the attempts to date these teeth have put them at merely 10,000 years old — an eyeblink in evolutionary time.All of which explains the feeding frenzy of speculation on internet sites such as Twitter and YouTube, where numerous videos have been uploaded with titles including \u0027Seven real megalodon sightings caught on camera\u0027 and \u0027Evidence that megalodon is not extinct.\u0027The believers tend to agree on the location of megalodon\u0027s primary lair: the Mariana Trench in the Western Pacific.This 1,500-mile-long canyon in the Earth\u0027s crust is more than 35,000 ft deep — 6,000 ft greater than Mount Everest — and is the deepest point in the world\u0027s oceans.          These \u0027megalodon believers\u0027 say titanically huge sharks do exist in the depths of today\u0027s oceans (pictured, a scene from The Meg)Crucially for conspiracy theorists, the Trench was fully formed more than 1.5 million years ago, when megalodon are believed to have disappeared. Couldn\u0027t they have evolved to go deep instead of being rendered extinct?Certainly, the Trench is a good place to hide pilots in submersiblets have only twice ventured nearly seven miles down to its furthest reaches, an area called the Challenger Deep, in 1960 and 2012. And we already have proof that huge marine creatures can remain largely unknown to us for centuries.Take the colossal squid, which was considered to be the legendary product of sailors\u0027 fevered imaginations. Then, in 1925, came the first evidence in the form of two tentacles found in a sperm whale\u0027s stomach. It is only in the past 40 years that bodies of entire creatures have been found.The biggest to date was caught in 2007 off Antarctica. Its corpse was 15 ft long and weighed 450kg, about the same as a grand piano.As for mysterious massive sharks, we know they exist. It was only in 1976 that the incredible megamouth shark was discovered when one became entangled in cables dangling from a U.S. navy research vessel in Hawaii.          These conspiracy theorists say scientists deny megalodon sharks exist due to fear they would be hunted into extinction (pictured, a scene from The Meg) Capable of growing 18 ft in length, with a bulbous head, giant mouth and tiny teeth, it feeds on tiny creatures filtered through sea water. Only 63 confirmed sightings have been reported worldwide since.Scientists say the reason they managed to evade human attention for so long is that they spend time feeding at great depths.So, if these giants can lurk unseen for millennia, surely the same is true of megalodon?After all, scientists have been prompted by recent discoveries to create a whole new category for creatures that we thought were extinct, but turn out to be alive still. It\u0027s known as the \u0027Lazarus taxonomy\u0027 and the coelacanth is the most famous example.The 6 ft fish was thought to have become extinct 65 million years ago. But in 1938 it was discovered alive off the coast of South Africa.Sadly, for Jaws fans, but happily for swimmers, when it come to megalodon, the scientific consensus seems to be a clear \u0027no\u0027.For megalodon to live somewhere such as the Mariana Trench, they would not only need to be able to survive at such depths and at immense pressures — 1,000 times greater than atmospheric pressure — but also to have access to food.But at 35,000 ft, the only prey are tiny shrimp-like creatures called amphipods. They wouldn\u0027t even count as a snack for megalodon.A little less deep, at around 13,000 ft, more substantial deep-sea fish such as lanternfish begin to emerge — but again too small.To find any decent-sized meal, it would have to come up to 8,000 ft, the deepest whales are known to e. And then, according to Emma Bernard, who curates the Natural History Museum\u0027s fossil fish collection, there would surely be evidence of megalodon\u0027s existence in the form of bite marks on whales that survived attacks.Most damningly, megalodon would have to cope with the freezing temperatures found at these depths, and it evolved exclusively as a warm-water species.When the climate cooled some three million years ago, they proved incapable of following their prey into cooler waters and thus became extinct.So, as shark hunter Quint in Jaws didn\u0027t quite say: \u0027We\u0027re not going to need a bigger boat after all.\u0027 Unless, of course..."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/07/4F0DF5A300000578-6053835-image-a-1_1534141692804.jpg","title":"Koreas hold high level talks leaders summit","story":"    South Korean President Moon Jae-in hugs North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in May as it was announced today there will be more peace talks in September          The rival Koreas have agreed to hold a third summit between their leaders in Pyongyang sometime before the end of September.

But the \u0027tempestuous\u0027 relationship foundered, leading to a bitter county court battle over their £1.7m former home near Chingford (pictured)And he rejected Ms Chapman\u0027s claim that she only transferred the house into joint names because of Ms Ladwa\u0027s \u0027undue influence\u0027.\u0027Having seen Ms Chapman give evidence, I cannot accept that Ms Ladwa was the kind of person who could make her act against her will,\u0027 he said.He added: \u0027Unfortunately, I was left with the impression that Ms Chapman has convinced herself that her version of events is to be preferred, regretting what she now perceives to have been undue generosity when she was in a relationship with Ms Ladwa.\u0027Central London County Court heard the couple began dating in 2000 and they lived together from very early on in their relationship.Ms Chapman worked in her family\u0027s successful building business, while Ms Ladwa was a third-year law student at university.          In court, Ms Chapman (pictured) said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationshipHer degree did not lead to a permanent job, nor her time training at cookery college, Le Cordon Bleu, Ms Chapman\u0027s lawyers told the court.The house, near Chingford, was bought for £1.4m in 2007 in Ms Chapman\u0027s name - but within a year transferred into their joint names.It is now thought to be worth £1.7m.The relationship finally ended in 2016, when the judge heard Ms Ladwa gave back her £75,000 engagement rings.The bitter falling out led to a court fight as the women argued over ownership of the house and Ms Chapman sued for the return of alleged loans, designer shoes, bags and jewellery by Cartier, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, and the proceeds of sale of the Aston Martin.In court, Ms Chapman said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationship. Ms Ladwa\u0027s only income was a £25,000-a-year allowance from her mother and Ms Chapman said it was only her ex\u0027s incessant nagging that led her to put the house in joint names.Alleging undue influence, she claimed Ms Ladwa behaved like a child begging for a toy, constantly badgering her until she relented.\u0027You get to the point where you are really tired out by hearing the same thing, again and again and again,\u0027 she told the judge.She had loaned almost £400,000 to Ms Ladwa over the years, much of which was used by her ex to trade shares on the stock market, she said.But Ms Ladwa said she had tried hard to get a solicitor\u0027s training contract and she had \u0027never pressured\u0027 and \u0027never hassled\u0027 Ms Chapman over the house.\u0027Bev told me it would be easier to secure the mortgage if it was just in her sole name,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was always going to be our home, our future home. I trusted her.\u0027Her barrister, Anthony Geadah, said it was a relationship of \u0027love and affection\u0027 and Ms Chapman had merely been honouring a \u0027promise\u0027 to a partner of many years when she agreed to put the house in joint names.                            \u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names. From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027                         - Judge Murch Comparing the case with a orce battle, he said Ms Ladwa was \u0027effectively the housewife\u0027, while Ms Chapman was out making money for them to live on. Ruling on the case, Judge Murch said the house had been bought largely with money from their joint bank account, including the proceeds of sale of their previous home.Even if Ms Chapman had made \u0027substantially greater contributions\u0027 to the account, it was a joint account which they must have regarded as joint property.\u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names,\u0027 he said.\u0027From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027He said that, although the couple moved out of the house in 2013, the relationship continued at rented homes in Kew and Covent Garden and there were at least two subsequent marriage proposals.Dismissing Ms Chapman\u0027s claims for return of jewellery, shoes and handbags, together worth around £130,000, he said they had been gifts to Ms Ladwa. Ms Chapman had the \u0027economic strength\u0027 in the relationship and it also was not expected that Ms Ladwa would pay back the money she was given over the years.\u0027These were substantial sums of money. I do not accept however that they at any stage regarded them as a loan,\u0027 he said.\u0027My reason for this is that they were at all times in a relationship in which they understood perfectly that Ms Chapman had greater wealth than Ms Ladwa.\u0027Although Ms Ladwa had been a law student when they met, and I do not doubt that on starting her studies she had intended to pursue a career in the law, this never happened.\u0027It is not clear to me why Ms Ladwa did not secure a training contract. It is clear to me however that they knew that she had not done so. The only income which she said she had was the allowance from her mother.\u0027Ms Chapman knew that Ms Ladwa had no income from a job and over time saw that this was not changing.\u0027It can never have been envisaged that Ms Ladwa would pay them back. I cannot conclude that it was ever discussed.\u0027The judge ruled that the couple agreed when the house was bought that it would be owned by them together and that, in later transferring it into joint names, Ms Chapman had not been subjected to undue pressure.Nothing changed afterwards to suggest that their intentions as to ownership of the property had altered, he found.The decision means the property is held in equal shares by the women and that Ms Ladwa does not have to return the money or the designer goods she was given.The case was considered in a three-day hearing at Central London County Court in January, and the judge\u0027s ruling only now made public.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/21/4F0CB2C500000578-6053053-Speaking_exclusively_to_MailOnline_Dr_Holman_said_I_m_just_so_re-m-36_1534105227041.jpg","title":"British mother locked Dubai drinking plane lands UK meets family","story":"    Dr Ellie Holman\u0027s four-year-old daughter Bibi, who was jailed with her in Dubai for three days, ran into her arms  Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Dr Holman said: \u0027I\u0027m just so relieved to be home and can\u0027t wait to be with my family, recover and rest.

I stayed awake for the whole three days,\u0027 she said. She claims they were also denied a pillow or a change of clothing and that Bibi was in a state of shock and refused to be comforted. After her release Dr Holman was allowed to stay with friends but her passport was confiscated, and she was told it might take up to a year until the matter is resolved.Her partner Gary flew from their home in Kent to Dubai to collect their youngest daughter. The couple estimate they have lost over £30,000 in earnings and money spent on legal fees.           Dr Holman\u0027s release came after the personal intervention of Dubai\u0027s ruler Sheikh Mohammed (pictured)          Emirates Airlines offers wine on flights from the UK to Dubai as standard practice (file picture)Since her arrest Dr Holman\u0027s practice in Sevenoaks has been closed. She praised the NGO Detained in Dubai for their help in securing her freedom. \u0027I can\u0027t thank Radha Stirling and her team at Detained in Dubai enough.

The new exams aim to bring performance in line with countries in Asia which are much higher than the UK in the international league tablesCath Jadhav, a director of standards at Ofqual, revealed its grading strategy for this year in a series of blog posts. She said: \u0027Student performance dips a little in the first years of a new qualification, because teachers are less familiar with the new specifications, and there are fewer support materials and past papers for students to use.\u0027Using statistics compensates for that dip, so that the 2018 cohort is not unfairly disadvantaged by being the first to sit these new qualifications.\u0027She said the results of the new A-levels will \u0027look similar\u0027 to last year, providing only that the \u0027ability make-up\u0027 of pupils has not changed. This means a similar proportion of entries – 26 per cent – will get an A or A*, while three quarters will be graded C or above.At GCSE the proportion of entries previously getting a C or above – two thirds – will be graded 4 or above this year.The bottom of grade 7 is equivalent to the bottom of the old A, and as before, 20 per cent should achieve this or above. Within this sub-group around 20 per cent again will get the top grade of 9.This means the 9 grade – which Oxford and Cambridge will use to identify the very brightest pupils – will be much harder to get than the old A*. However, some teachers are still worried the volatility of the reforms could mean pupils miss out on the results they deserve.The changes were brought in partly because leading universities had complained pupils were arriving poorly prepared for the demands of degrees.They also said they found it difficult to choose between thousands of applicants who had achieved straight As and A*s at GCSE and were predicted top grades at A-level as well.A-level results come out on Thursday and GCSE results are out on August 23."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/04/4F0EBC8400000578-6053921-image-a-56_1534132104899.jpg","title":"Drivers stunned small plane makes emergency landing freeway","story":"    Drivers in San Leandro, California were stunned when a small plane made an emergency landing on the highway          A couple captured the unusual incident on dash cam Saturday evening          The small plane had suffered a fuel pump issue shortly the emergency landingThe couple is heard saying repeatedly as the plane swoops into traffic: \u0027Oh my gosh!

But the \u0027tempestuous\u0027 relationship foundered, leading to a bitter county court battle over their £1.7m former home near Chingford (pictured)And he rejected Ms Chapman\u0027s claim that she only transferred the house into joint names because of Ms Ladwa\u0027s \u0027undue influence\u0027.\u0027Having seen Ms Chapman give evidence, I cannot accept that Ms Ladwa was the kind of person who could make her act against her will,\u0027 he said.He added: \u0027Unfortunately, I was left with the impression that Ms Chapman has convinced herself that her version of events is to be preferred, regretting what she now perceives to have been undue generosity when she was in a relationship with Ms Ladwa.\u0027Central London County Court heard the couple began dating in 2000 and they lived together from very early on in their relationship.Ms Chapman worked in her family\u0027s successful building business, while Ms Ladwa was a third-year law student at university.          In court, Ms Chapman (pictured) said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationshipHer degree did not lead to a permanent job, nor her time training at cookery college, Le Cordon Bleu, Ms Chapman\u0027s lawyers told the court.The house, near Chingford, was bought for £1.4m in 2007 in Ms Chapman\u0027s name - but within a year transferred into their joint names.It is now thought to be worth £1.7m.The relationship finally ended in 2016, when the judge heard Ms Ladwa gave back her £75,000 engagement rings.The bitter falling out led to a court fight as the women argued over ownership of the house and Ms Chapman sued for the return of alleged loans, designer shoes, bags and jewellery by Cartier, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, and the proceeds of sale of the Aston Martin.In court, Ms Chapman said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationship. Ms Ladwa\u0027s only income was a £25,000-a-year allowance from her mother and Ms Chapman said it was only her ex\u0027s incessant nagging that led her to put the house in joint names.Alleging undue influence, she claimed Ms Ladwa behaved like a child begging for a toy, constantly badgering her until she relented.\u0027You get to the point where you are really tired out by hearing the same thing, again and again and again,\u0027 she told the judge.She had loaned almost £400,000 to Ms Ladwa over the years, much of which was used by her ex to trade shares on the stock market, she said.But Ms Ladwa said she had tried hard to get a solicitor\u0027s training contract and she had \u0027never pressured\u0027 and \u0027never hassled\u0027 Ms Chapman over the house.\u0027Bev told me it would be easier to secure the mortgage if it was just in her sole name,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was always going to be our home, our future home. I trusted her.\u0027Her barrister, Anthony Geadah, said it was a relationship of \u0027love and affection\u0027 and Ms Chapman had merely been honouring a \u0027promise\u0027 to a partner of many years when she agreed to put the house in joint names.                            \u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names. From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027                         - Judge Murch Comparing the case with a orce battle, he said Ms Ladwa was \u0027effectively the housewife\u0027, while Ms Chapman was out making money for them to live on. Ruling on the case, Judge Murch said the house had been bought largely with money from their joint bank account, including the proceeds of sale of their previous home.Even if Ms Chapman had made \u0027substantially greater contributions\u0027 to the account, it was a joint account which they must have regarded as joint property.\u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names,\u0027 he said.\u0027From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027He said that, although the couple moved out of the house in 2013, the relationship continued at rented homes in Kew and Covent Garden and there were at least two subsequent marriage proposals.Dismissing Ms Chapman\u0027s claims for return of jewellery, shoes and handbags, together worth around £130,000, he said they had been gifts to Ms Ladwa. Ms Chapman had the \u0027economic strength\u0027 in the relationship and it also was not expected that Ms Ladwa would pay back the money she was given over the years.\u0027These were substantial sums of money. I do not accept however that they at any stage regarded them as a loan,\u0027 he said.\u0027My reason for this is that they were at all times in a relationship in which they understood perfectly that Ms Chapman had greater wealth than Ms Ladwa.\u0027Although Ms Ladwa had been a law student when they met, and I do not doubt that on starting her studies she had intended to pursue a career in the law, this never happened.\u0027It is not clear to me why Ms Ladwa did not secure a training contract. It is clear to me however that they knew that she had not done so. The only income which she said she had was the allowance from her mother.\u0027Ms Chapman knew that Ms Ladwa had no income from a job and over time saw that this was not changing.\u0027It can never have been envisaged that Ms Ladwa would pay them back. I cannot conclude that it was ever discussed.\u0027The judge ruled that the couple agreed when the house was bought that it would be owned by them together and that, in later transferring it into joint names, Ms Chapman had not been subjected to undue pressure.Nothing changed afterwards to suggest that their intentions as to ownership of the property had altered, he found.The decision means the property is held in equal shares by the women and that Ms Ladwa does not have to return the money or the designer goods she was given.The case was considered in a three-day hearing at Central London County Court in January, and the judge\u0027s ruling only now made public.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/354d7ce584029481854e9f661921cf033efa7d1a/0_0_3500_2031/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b7678d11b6cf2b52208b9bdaa04a0198 1400w","title":"maori man sues employer being given black guy repellent sunscreen","story":"Queensland tour company denies discrimination because it says the incident was a jokeBut Rainbow Beach Adventure Company says that while the incident did happen, it did not constitute discrimination because it was intended as a practical joke between good friends.McDuff Tupetagi is seeking damages from the Fraser Island business and two of its employees, Mervin O’Neill and Joel Mahon, over the alleged discrimination, which was first reported by Fairfax Media.Documents filed this month in the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission allege that Tupetagi had “frequently been made the butt of ‘black jokes’ and referred to with words to the effect of ‘where is the black fella?’” since he started at the business in 2014.Tupetagi, who has a dark brown complexion, says that in 2016 he had asked his boss, Mervin O’Neill, for a sunshade to be installed so he did not have to work in the open sun. That request was refused, he says.Three months later, when he approached O’Neill’s manager, Byron Rush, to repeat the request, he alleges Rush told him it was refused, saying “words to the effect of ‘because you’re black’”, according to the statement of facts seen by  Australia.“By Byron’s words, Byron imputed to the complainant that he was less or not susceptible to sunburn and skin damage from the sun because of his skin colour,” the statement says.On 8 November 2017, Tupetagi was told by his coworkers that there was a “present in the car”, he said.Tupetagi says in the statement of facts that receiving the canister of sunscreen made him feel like an “unwanted creature or pest”.He remains absent from work, and needs “extensive and ongoing psychiatric intervention including psychoactive pharmacology for a number of diagnoses including severe depression and agoraphobia”. A claim was accepted by Work Cover, despite being disputed by his employer.Court documents filed on Friday for Rainbow Beach Adventure Company, Mahon and O’Neill by DLA Piper litigation lawyer Sophie Devitt O’Neill say that the sunscreen canister incident “would not have made the complainant felt likened to an unwanted creature or pest as it was a practical joke between good friends”.O’Neill says that a week after the incident with the sunscreen canister, he held a meeting with all employees in which he said such behaviour would not be tolerated and would constitute a fireable a offence in future.He says he was unaware of the sunshade conversation between Tupetagi and Rush. He also says he’s unaware of the request being refused “as a sunshade has now been installed over the work area”.O’Neill and Rainbow Beach Adventure Company say they are unaware of any other employees making comments about Tupetagi, and Mahon says that Tupetagi would “refer to himself as the ‘token black guy’”.Rainbow Beach Adventure Company is owned by Website Travel Group, Fairfax reported.  Australia contacted Website Travel Group for comment.Website Travel Group’s general manager, Barry Downes, earlier told Fairfax: “We value all our employees and are supporting the proceedings.”He told  Australia in a statement:“We find the actions of the employee concerned to be abhorrent and totally unacceptable, the employee has apologised for his offensive behaviour. His conduct in this matter in no way reflects the culture or beliefs of our company, managers and staff. We promptly addressed the matter with the employee and he deeply regrets his actions. While it’s disappointing that the damage has been done to what was previously a close and long standing friendship between these two employees, the matter will be before the Commission in the comings weeks and it would be inappropriate to make further comment” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a95ea4de8e885928a58a3b537c775ad6dfa53e/0_208_5133_3080/master/5133.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b02efdb94c1b51e182abdf63b8be124","title":"best books self obsession knausgaard nix writers satire","story":"Solipsistic novels, a study of narcissism, a biography of a Michelin starred chef ... here are some of the best, from Dostoevsky to Karl Ove KnausgaardA level of self-absorption is a necessity for most writers. Every novel is ultimately about its author, and I like my non-fiction self-obsessed, too. Then there are the works that combine the two.Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard specialises in semi-fictional self-obsession. A Death in the Family, translated by Don Bartlett, charts a period of his life centring around his alcoholic father’s death. Knausgaard has a spectacular gift for finding profundity in the mundane details of his existence. In other books, his fascination with himself can sometimes become too much, but the balance between intimate detail and story is pretty much perfect here.Another brilliant novel of self-obsession is Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground. The book has two halves, the first of which is the narrator’s extended rant about himself to the stars, and famously begins: “I am a sick man … I am a wicked man.”This is bad self-obsession: tedious, aimless and indulgent. But it’s worth pushing through (or just skipping entirely) for part two, in which the tirade becomes an absorbing and unforgettable story of a dysfunctional young man who – sometimes comically, sometimes tragically – can’t see beyond himself, thereby alienating everyone he comes into contact with.In the course of researching my own novel, I came across The Perfectionist by Rudolph Chelminski, a fantastic biography of Bernard Loiseau, the three Michelin starred chef who killed himself in 2003 on the eve of the new guide being published. It is a brilliant study of the dangers of identifying the self too closely with career success.For those interested in more detail about why our culture feels as if it’s become more self-obsessed since the start of the millennium, The Narcissism Epidemic by psychologists Jean Twenge and Keith Campbell is essential. Their work, showing that narcissism levels seem to have started rising significantly in the 1990s, has been controversial. But their argument, that the increase, at least in part, is the result of changing parenting and teaching styles that started focusing on self-esteem and protection from failure – as opposed to the pursuit of success – is compelling and they have answered many critics convincingly. My favourite novel of our solipsistic times is easily The Nix by Nathan Hill. Laura Pottsdam is a student caught plagiarising by her literature professor, the protagonist of the novel Samuel Andresen-Anderson. Pottsdam is the crushing embodiment of our Trumpian age. Not only entirely unrepentant, she is vengeful, and becomes her professor’s nemesis, all the while keeping her massive social network updated on her mental wellbeing via her iFeel app, which offers a predefined selection of emotional states from which to choose. Her followers can then broadcast their emotional responses to her emotional responses via a convenient auto-response function.If his debut is anything to go by, Hill may well one day be seen as the Charles Dickens of our self-obsessed age.• Will Storr’s Selfie: How the West Became Self-Obsessed is published by Picador."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf308d7aa5141672a2ef0e11e385a8879334c019/0_0_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab9f5cc7927e8d1adbda2cf2d2e4579","title":"companies brexit supply shock fewer eu citizens arrive uk","story":"Businesses are struggling to fill vacancies as a result of drop in new EU workers, says reportCompanies are suffering from a “supply shock” as fewer EU citizens come to the UK, and companies struggle to fill vacancies, according to a survey of 2,000 employers.The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said the number of applicants per vacancy had fallen since last summer across all levels of skilled jobs, and said shortages were forcing many companies to raise wages. The number of people moving to the UK from other EU countries has fallen to its lowest level since 2013, according to the latest official figures, with the net figure for long-term migration from the bloc at 101,000 in 2017The number of people applying for the average low-skilled vacancy has fallen from 24 to 20 in the past year and from 19 to 10 for medium-skilled posts. Half of organisations with recruitment problems said they had increased starting salaries in response. Gerwyn Davies of CIPD said: “The most recent official data shows that there has been a significant slowdown in the number of EU nationals coming to work in the UK over the past year. “This is feeding into increasing recruitment and retention challenges, particularly for employers in sectors that have historically relied on non-UK labour to fill roles and which are particularly vulnerable to the prospect of future changes to immigration policy for EU migrants.”Alex Fleming of recruiters the Adecco Group, which helped with the research, added: “With Brexit looming we’re seeing a talent shortage and a more competitive marketplace. In this candidate-short landscape the pressure is on employers to not only offer an attractive salary, but also additional benefits.”A government spokesman said: “EU citizens make a huge contribution to our economy and we have been clear from the beginning of this process that we want these citizens and their families in the UK to be able to stay. “After we leave the EU, the UK will continue to be the open country it has always been. We will have in place an immigration system that delivers control over who comes to the UK, but that welcomes the brightest and best who want to work hard and contribute.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0799a152476edc53ca679ba7d42f12c20cfcce9c/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=559ed68cc08738532f1d7087d322f139","title":"dollar general walmart buhler haven kansas","story":"As the chain opens stores at the rate of three a day across the US, often in the hearts of ‘food deserts’, some see Dollar General as an admission that a town is failingWhen Dollar General came to Haven, Kansas, it arrived making demands. The fastest growing retailer in America wanted the taxpayers of the small, struggling Kansas town to pick up part of the tab for building one of its squat, barebones stores that more often resemble a warehouse than a neighbourhood shop.Dollar General thought Haven’s council should give the company a $72,000 break on its utility bills, equivalent to the cost of running the town’s library and swimming pool for a year, on the promise of jobs and tax revenues. The council blanched but ended up offering half of that amount to bring the low-price outlet to a town that already had a grocery store.“Dollar General are a force. It’s hard to stop a train,” said Mike Alfers, Haven’s then mayor who backed the move. “Obviously there’s been collateral damage. We didn’t expect it. I’m torn but, net-net, I still think it was a good move to bring them in.”The Dollar General opened in Haven at the end of February 2015. Three years later, the company applied to build a similar store in the neighbouring town of Buhler, a 20-minute drive along a ramrod straight road north through sprawling Kansas farmland. Buhler’s mayor, Daniel Friesen, watched events unfold in Haven and came to see Dollar General not so much an opportunity as a diagnosis. Friesen understood why dying towns with no shops beyond the convenience store at the gas station welcomed Dollar General out of desperation for anything at all, like Burton, just up the road, where the last food shop closed 20 years ago. But Buhler had a high street with grocery and hardware stores, a busy cafe and a clothes shop. It had life. As Friesen saw it, Dollar General was not only a threat to all that but amounted to admission his town was failing. “It was about retaining the soul of the community. It was about, what kind of town do we want?” he said.Dollar General is opening stores at the rate of three a day across the US. It moves into places not even Walmart will go, targeting rural towns and damaged inner-city neighbourhoods with basic goods at basic prices – a strategy described by a former chief executive of the chain as “we went where they ain’t”.The chain now has more outlets across the country than McDonald’s has restaurants, and its profits have surged past some of the grand old names of American retail. The company estimates that three-quarters of the population lives within five miles of one of its stores, which stock everything from groceries and household cleaners to clothes and tools. Not everything is to be had for a dollar, but rarely is anything priced above $10. But there is a cost. Dollar General’s aggressive pricing drives locally-owned grocery stores out of business, replacing shelves stocked with fresh fruit, vegetables and meat with the kinds of processed foods underpinning the country’s obesity and diabetes crisis. Dollar Generals are frequently found at the heart of “food deserts”, defined by the department of agriculture as a rural community where one-third of residents live more than 10 miles from a grocery store selling fresh produce. That was not what bothered Friesen. He saw construction of a Dollar General more as a statement about the health of his town as a whole than any one of its 1,400 residents.If Dollar General were to be believed, there was a sound economic benefit for Buhler from one of its stores. This time the company didn’t ask the council for money. Instead it sold the promise of prosperity, claiming it would boost the town’s coffers with increased sales tax revenues by encouraging residents to shop locally instead of traveling to distant supermarkets for what they cannot find at the grocery store. Buhler’s council called two public meetings in March to gauge the mood of residents and invited Doug Nech, owner of neighbouring Haven’s only grocery store, the Foodliner, to speak. Dollar General had driven his shop out of business days earlier. The arrival of Dollar General cost the Foodliner hundreds of thousands of dollars over that time. The foremost challenge was price. The chain has the power of scale in negotiating with foodmakers. Nech discovered the store had done a deal with Campbell’s Soup to make a 14.5 oz can of chicken noodle soup for $1.50, the price he was paying wholesale for an 11 oz can of the same soup.“Dollar General have buying power. There’s not a lot of competition at the wholesale level so it’s rather difficult and the smaller you are, you pay a higher price for goods whether it’s in delivery costs or volume buying or any number of things,” he said.Nech calls Dollar General “a cancer” but reserves his anger for Haven’s council for subsidising a hugely profitable corporation to compete against him. He asked the council to cut to his shop’s utility bill to $100 a month until the Foodliner received a matching benefit. It refused, saying that Dollar General had taken advantage of a programme to bring in new business while Nech’s was long established. “It’s the principle that they gave them money to come to town. I’m kind of conservative. I don’t believe in asking government for anything and I damn sure don’t believe in asking the government for anything now,” he said.Friesen said Nech’s account “scared a lot of people” in Buhler who feared they could lose their own grocery store. The council also took on board what happened in a town an hour northeast of Buhler when a small Walmart moved in, put two grocery stores out of business and then shut down, leaving the town with nothing. “Dollar General, Walmart, any large corporation, doesn’t have the best interests of our community at heart here at all,” said the mayor.Buhler’s council was not reassured by Dollar General’s attempts to say that it should not even discuss the store and its potential impact at the planning meetings. The company submitted its application through the developer assigned to build the outlet. The developer sought a change of use for the land from agricultural to retail without specifying what kind of shop it planned to construct. Friesen said Dollar General did not want its name brought up during the council’s deliberations. “Dollar General were saying this wasn’t an application for a Dollar General, it was an application for a retail store. It could be anything. It could be a clothing store. They didn’t want us to consider some significant issues such as local economic impact,” he said. The council asked an expert on the impact of cut-price stores from Kansas State University to address the public meeting. David Procter laid out the ways independently-owned family businesses generally benefit small communities. “On the average there are about 15 employees in these small grocery stores and Dollar General stores might have five employees. Profits from small town grocery stores are generally going to stay in that town whereas profits made by Dollar General, a significant percentage of them anyway, are going to the corporate office in Tennessee,” he said. Procter said many local grocery stores also serve as community gathering places, some of them with delis and seating areas where people have lunch, and offer services such as home delivery for the elderly or infirm. Dollar General, which tends to build spartan shops on the edge of towns to catch passing traffic on main roads, does none of these. “Grocery stores give more back to the community. They are much more likely to support local sporting teams, local faith-based organisations. Dollar General corporate policy sets a pretty strict limit on how much community giving they provide,” said Procter. Some at the public meeting spoke up in favour of the chain. They liked its long opening hours – most of Buhler’s shops are closed on a Sunday – and cheaper prices. But the sentiment was overwhelmingly against the store and an informal online poll of the town’s resident came out two to one in opposition. Some people didn’t want an ugly building as the gateway to the town.A retirement community next to the planned site objected. In the end, people in Buhler decided that although the grocery and hardware stores might cost a little more they were prepared to pay a premium to preserve their community. Buhler has a large brown and yellow sign on the main road into town. It features a cross with an open book suggestive of a bible. On one page is written “traditional values” and on the other “progressive ideas”. “There were some who said this is not very progressive to deny a new retail development in the community,” said Friesen. “But there was agreement in the city council that the more progressive thing is to not do what every small community in Kansas seems like it’s doing, just begging for a national retail chain to come in.”Days after Nech was driven out of business in Haven, Buhler’s council voted unanimously to reject Dollar General. The company’s developer was not pleased. “I wasn’t terribly impressed. They stormed out. They were pretty hot about it,” said Friesen. In Haven, the former mayor, Mike Alfers, conceded that the promised financial advantage of Dollar General has largely been lost with the closure of the Foodliner. It is now a fitness centre, with the old grocery store sign still hanging outside. Sales tax revenue for the town rose by more than $60,000 between the years before and after the Dollar General opened. But the Foodliner alone was collecting around $75,000 a year in sales tax which is now gone. On top of that, Nech paid an annual electricity bill of $37,000, which the city made money on, plus the break the council gave Dollar General on its utility bills. It remains to be seen how much business will transfer from the defunct grocery store to the Dollar General but the end result is the Haven’s main street is finding it even more of a struggle to survive with the diminished flow of people to pick up groceries. For all that, while Alfers feels sympathy for Nech, he said the Dollar General is the future. “The Model-T put horses out of business. It’s hard to protect existing businesses,” he said. “I would still vote for Dollar General. If one state didn’t accept the Model-T it wouldn’t have changed the outcome. I think Buhler voted their sentiment. The question is, in five years will they have a Dollar General or something similar?”The owner of Buhler’s grocery store, JC Keith, is acutely aware that seeing off Dollar General is not the only challenge. With decent paying jobs increasingly scarce in rural Kansas, a good part of the population of Buhler and Haven work in large towns with ready access to a range of rivals from Walmart to farmers markets. It’s easier for residents of what have become bedroom communities to stop at a major store on the way home from work and only use the local grocery shop for last-minute supplies such as milk. “A majority of people in Buhler that work, work somewhere else,” said Keith, who is also a long-distance truck driver. “Chances are they drive right by some chain store on their way home.” The threat from Dollar General prompted Keith to evaluate his way of doing business. He was already in the process of building a larger shop just down the road from the existing one, but now it will incorporate hot foods such as chicken and a salad bar. It will also open later. For all his support for building the Dollar General in Haven, Alfers rarely shops there and regrets the loss of the Foodliner. “It makes a lot of difference to me. I shopped a lot at Foodliner,” he said. “Now I have a hard time time shopping at Dollar General. I like to cook. I like food items and spices you can’t get at Dollar General. I’m less loyal to any one store these days.”Haven’s residents now have to travel out of town to find fresh food, although many do that for work in any case. The more immediate impact has been on those who are less mobile, like the elderly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates that about one quarter of the population is unable to buy healthy food nearby. Dollar Generals are frequently to be found in those areas and some studies have made a direct link between the rise of dollar stores and unhealthy eating. But it is not that straightforward. Megan Rinehart worked at Nech’s Foodliner for six years.“This isn’t a rich town. A lot of our customers bought not healthy stuff. They leaned towards what was fast and cheap. We had a pretty good selection of fresh produce. It was a matter of if they could afford it,” she said. An agriculture department study found that many of those on low income and reliant on food stamps were more likely to decide where to shop based on price than where the nearest store is. They drive past a grocery store to a Dollar General. Alfers thinks Buhler will struggle to stave off the cut-price chain store because it is the future. Doug Nech is not so sure. He owned the Foodliner alongside a job travelling a dozen states as a church pew cushion salesman. Nech has seen the impact across the midwest of the store that put his own out of business He views Dollar General as a juggernaut but that does not mean he thinks it’s invincible.“Dollar General is building just as fast as it can. Nebraska. The Dakotas. You see it,” he said. “But somewhere down the line, as these small towns dry up, business for Dollar General is going to dry up just like it does for a grocery store. If there’s nobody new coming to town and your older population is dying off and they’re not getting replaced very quickly, who are they going to sell to?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b4c227ff46c45a2e135982045f6cd6206d867/1_0_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=375ec7a53584692da37af1fddcf66f60","title":"is free trade always the answer","story":"As Brexit talks continue, we answer the key questions on the free flow of goodsAs concerns over Donald Trump’s import tariffs intensify and ministers renegotiate Britain’s trading relationship with Europe, the postwar consensus towards ever-closer economic cooperation between wealthy nations is being unpicked.Economists argue about a lot of things, yet many would probably agree on the benefits of free trade, which generates wealth by allowing the free flow of goods across international borders, without taxes and other such barriers.The argument runs that billions of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty by the combined power of capitalism and free trade. We are taught that the world’s most powerful nations spurred their advance by tearing down the castle walls of protectionism during the latter half of the 19th century – ending centuries of beggar-thy-neighbour economic nationalism – opening up new markets to boost the industrial revolution and drive forward the development of the middle class.John Stuart Mill wrote that, once upon a time, the average patriot “wished all countries weak, poor and ill-governed, but his own: he now sees in their wealth and progress a direct source of wealth and progress to his own country”.Two ideas remain central to the theory of international trade more than 200 years later.In his seminal work The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith taught countries to concentrate their efforts on producing and selling goods in which they have an “absolute advantage” over their trading partners. Cheaper labour costs give modern-day China an absolute advantage over most western nations for manufacturing. But what happens when a country has absolute advantage in multiple industries?In the 19th century, David Ricardo took the idea further by arguing that one country might have a comparative advantage over the other. He said it was possible for England to produce more wine and cloth than Portugal. However, it would require greater effort in England, handing Portugal a comparative advantage.Both theories teach nations to focus their time on making and selling goods in which they have an advantage over their rivals, for mutual benefit through free trade. Consumers will benefit from lower prices in both nations.Classical economic theory does not, however, always work in practice, and the rules require all nations to sing from the same hymn sheet. Unfettered capitalism across borders still creates winners and losers, posing thorny social and political questions for policymakers where dry economic models cannot help. There are thousands of ways nations can distort the playing field. The most extreme might be the use of military intervention, although far more common are subsidies for particular industries, tax, spending and the use of the legal system. Trump’s import tariffs are the most high-profile example.Tariffs are border taxes charged on foreign imports. Importers pay the charges at the point of entry to the customs agency of the country or economic bloc imposing them. Rather than being used to raise revenue, they are imposed to increase the price of foreign goods in order to make domestic produce comparatively cheaper, with the aim of encouraging domestic production and protecting firms from global competition. Economists mostly agree higher tariffs are counterproductive. While they can protect jobs, they also tend to raise the price of goods for consumers and stifle innovation that could benefit the economy.With the US the most powerful nation in the WTO and the driving force behind its creation in 1995, much of the organisation is hewn in the image of America. Trump, however, views membership as a “disaster”.Besides using tariffs to protect domestic industries, countries often provide support to certain sectors through state subsidies, or impose quotas restricting the volume of goods imported from overseas. There are also non-tariff barriers such as patent rules, health and safety regulations, labour and environmental standards, and rules of origin (for example, parmesan cheese can only come from northern Italy).Non-tariff rules have forged countries’ domestic policies closer together in recent decades to enable greater levels of international trade. After all, we wouldn’t want to have higher car safety standards for foreign goods than our own. Herein lie many of the arguments about how Britain will arrange its trade with the EU or US after Brexit.There are fears the US would push Britain to lower its food safety standards. That could allow the sale of chlorinated chicken. Meanwhile, Brexiters are concerned the UK adhering to EU rules could hinder trade deals with the rest of the world.Many economists would argue trade deficits are an irrelevance, although surpluses are often seen as economic virility symbols. Persistent deficits require funding via international borrowing, which becomes harder if confidence in a country falls. There are other risks from reliance on imports over domestic production. National security is one: should a country sacrifice the ability to produce steel required for making tanks, for example. Trump is using national security legislation for much of his tariffs, although some observers argue he has done so because the law is harder for the US political system to block, delay or modify.The other risk is that imports support jobs overseas, rather than at home. Jobs! Jobs! Jobs! was the president’s rallying cry ahead of his election. Workers in industries competing most with imports – typically in manufacturing – do tend to lose out, economists have found, while employment shifts towards sectors less exposed to trade.Without smooth transitions for struggling industries, or the safety net of the welfare state – through jobseeker benefits, education and training – whole communities can be left bereft of work. Britain during the 1980s was a classic example, as the government of Margaret Thatcher chose to shut UK mines and import coal from South Africa and Argentina. Trade deals always create winners and losers. But while the choice is a matter for politics, these decisions often come amid an onslaught of lobbying from powerful vested interests. Some observers argue free trade deals are therefore often simply the result of rent-seeking by politically well-connected parties.The failed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the US and the EU is one recent example, where corporate interests including the US private health industry wanted to expand to new markets in Europe. The deal ultimately failed amid widespread public opposition.There are fears trade deals benefit larger corporations already operating across international borders, rather than smaller firms. Domestic producers can be squeezed out by global rivals with huge economies of scale. The argument could be best put by the political theorist Isaiah Berlin who noted “freedom for the pike is death for the minnows”.However, international firms often support networks of smaller companies in their supply chains. Greater trade barriers can make it more difficult for multinationals to operate across borders, meaning they could relocate elsewhere where it is easier for them to do so – directly and indirectly affecting jobs and economic growth. After the gradual advance of globalisation in recent years, rapidly unpicking the progress may cause severe short-term pain.Economists argue international competition stimulates greater innovation and productivity, while warning protectionism can hinder progress. The quantity and quality of Soviet cars and other eastern bloc goods serves as one example, while the poor reputation of cars made by the British motor industry during the 1970s might be another. Consumers have benefited as the quality of goods have improved and prices have fallen. There are already signs Trump’s import tariffs and retaliatory measures are having an effect. Industrial surveys show manufacturers are suffering from higher costs of materials and longer delivery times in the US and the eurozone, while production is also slowing. Harley-Davidson has said it will need to move production of motorcycles for European consumers outside the US after the EU carried through a threat to tax American motorbikes, following the imposition of steel tariffs by Washington. In the UK, Airbus and BMW have warned of lost jobs and withheld investment triggered by uncertainty over the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU. Figures from the Office for National Statistics already report falling levels of business investment in the UK since the EU referendum. The next major flashpoint will come when the US completes a national security investigation into car and truck imports, due before February next year. For the UK, the key test for leaving the EU will come in October when the European Council meets to consider the Brexit deal, ahead of Britain formally withdrawing in March next year. The disputes could rumble on for many years. Although the EU has hit back against US steel and aluminium tariffs with $3.2bn of levies on US goods, it has held back a second round of duties on $4.2bn with an implementation date of June 2021 to put pressure on the White House."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3bd6fb3cbcb244d0fc0ff0e77e1a75cfbdbc67b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c2ce3fbcb0138d051b3b2f71b5a468","title":"halfway boiling city 50c","story":"It is the temperature at which human cells start to cook, animals suffer and air conditioners overload power grids. Once an urban anomaly, 50C is fast becoming realityby  Jonathan Watts and  Elle HuntImagine a city at 50C (122F). The pavements are empty, the parks quiet, entire neighbourhoods appear uninhabited. Nobody with a choice ventures outside during daylight hours. Only at night do the denizens emerge, HG Wells-style, into the streets – though, in temperatures that high, even darkness no longer provides relief. Uncooled air is treated like effluent: to be flushed as quickly as possible.School playgrounds are silent as pupils shelter inside. In the hottest hours of the day, working outdoors is banned. The only people in sight are those who do not have access to air conditioning, who have no escape from the blanket of heat: the poor, the homeless, undocumented labourers. Society is ided into the cool haves and the hot have-nots.Those without the option of sheltering indoors can rely only on shade, or perhaps a water-soaked sheet hung in front of a fan. Construction workers, motor-rickshaw drivers and street hawkers cover up head to toe to stay cool. The wealthy, meanwhile, go from one climate-conditioned environment to another: homes, cars, offices, gymnasiums, malls.Asphalt heats up 10-20C higher than the air. You really could fry an egg on the pavement. A dog’s paws would blister on a short walk, so pets are kept behind closed doors. There are fewer animals overall many species of mammals and birds have migrated to cooler environments, perhaps at a higher altitude – or perished. Reptiles, unable to regulate their body temperatures or dramatically expand their range, are worst placed to adapt. Even insects suffer.Maybe in the beginning, when it was just a hot spell, there was a boom in spending as delighted consumers snapped up sunglasses, bathing suits, BBQs, garden furniture and beer. But the novelty quickly faded when relentless sunshine became the norm. Consumers became more selective. Power grids are overloaded by cooling units. The heat is now a problem.The temperature is recalibrating behaviour. Appetites tend to fade as the body avoids the thermal effect of food and tempers are quicker to flare – along, perhaps, with crime and social unrest. But eventually lethargy sets in as the body shuts down and any prolonged period spent outdoors becomes dangerous.Hospitals see a surge in admissions for heat stress, respiratory problems and other illnesses exacerbated by high temperatures. Some set up specialist wards. The elderly, the obese and the sick are most at risk. Deaths rise.At 50C – halfway to water’s boiling point and more than 10C above a healthy body temperature – heat becomes toxic. Human cells start to cook, blood thickens, muscles lock around the lungs and the brain is choked of oxygen. In dry conditions, sweat – the body’s in-built cooling system – can lessen the impact. But this protection weakens if there is already moisture in the air.A so-called “wet-bulb temperature” (which factors in humidity) of just 35C can be fatal after a few hours to even the fittest person, and scientists warn climate change will make such conditions increasingly common in India, Pakistan, south-east Asia and parts of China. Even under the most optimistic predictions for emissions reductions, experts say almost half the world’s population will be exposed to potentially deadly heat for 20 days a year by 2100.Not long ago, 50C was considered an anomaly, but it is increasingly widespread. Earlier this year, the 1.1 million residents of Nawabshah, Pakistan, endured the hottest April ever recorded on Earth, as temperatures hit 50.2C. In neighbouring India two years earlier, the town of Phalodi sweltered in 51C – the country’s hottest ever day.Dev Niyogi, chair of the Urban Environment department at the American Meteorological Society, witnessed how cities were affected by extreme heat on a research trip to New Delhi and Pune during that 2015 heatwave in India, which killed more than 2,000 people.“You could see the physical change. Road surfaces started to melt, neighbourhoods went quiet because people didn’t go out and water vapour rose off the ground like a desert mirage,” he recalls.“We must hope that we don’t see 50C. That would be uncharted territory. Infrastructure would be crippled and ecosystem services would start to break down, with long-term consequences.”Several cities in the Gulf are getting increasingly accustomed to such heat. Basra – population 2.1 million – registered 53.9C two years ago. Kuwait City and Doha have experienced 50C or more in the past decade. At Quriyat, on the coast of Oman, overnight temperatures earlier this summer remained above 42.6C, which is believed to be the highest “low” temperature ever recorded in the world.At Mecca, the two million hajj pilgrims who visit each year need ever more sophisticated support to beat the heat. On current trends, it is only a matter of time before temperatures exceed the record 51.3C reached in 2012. Last year, traditionalists were irked by plans to install what are reportedly the world’s biggest retractable umbrellas to provide shade on the courtyards and roof of the Great Mosque. Air conditioners weighing 25 tonnes have been brought in to ventilate four of the biggest tents. Thousands of fans already cool the marble floors and carpets, while police on horseback spray the crowds with water.At the Australian open in Melbourne this year – when ambient temperatures reached 40C – players were staggering around like “punch-drunk boxers” due to heatstroke. Even walking outside can feel oppressive at higher temperatures. “The blast of furnace-like heat ... literally feels life-threatening and apocalyptic,” says Nigel Tapper, professor of environmental science at Melbourne’s Monash University, of the 48C recorded in parts of the city. “You cannot move outside for more than a few minutes.”The feeling of foreboding is amplified by the increased threat of bush and forest fires, he adds. “You cannot help but ask, ‘How can this city operate under these conditions? What can we do to ensure that the city continues to provide important services for these conditions? What can we do to reduce temperatures in the city?’”Those places already struggling with extreme heat are doing what they can. In Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, hospitals have opened specialist heat wards. Australian cities have made swimming pools accessible to the homeless when the heat creeps above 40C, and instructed schools to cancel playground time. In Kuwait, outside work is forbidden between noon and 4pm when temperatures soar.But many regulations are ignored, and companies and iniduals underestimate the risks. In almost all countries, hospital admissions and death rates tend to rise when temperatures pass 35C – which is happening more often, in more places. Currently, 354 major cities experience average summer temperatures in excess of 35C by 2050, climate change will push this to 970, according to the recent “Future We Don’t Want” study by the C40 alliance of the world’s biggest metropolises. In the same period, it predicts the number of urban dwellers exposed to this level of extreme heat will increase eightfold, to 1.6 billion.As baselines shift across the globe, 50C is also uncomfortably near for tens of millions more people. This year, Chino, 50km (30 miles) from Los Angeles, hit a record of 48.9C, Sydney saw 47C, and Madrid and Lisbon also experienced temperatures in the mid-40s. New studies suggest France “could easily exceed” 50C by the end of the century while Australian cities are forecast to reach this point even earlier. Kuwait, meanwhile, could sizzle towards an uninhabitable 60C.How to cool dense populations is now high on the political and academic agenda, says Niyogi, who last week co-chaired an urban climate symposium in New York. Cities can be modified to deplete heat through measures to conserve water, create shade and deflect heat. In many places around the world, these steps are already under way.The city at 50C could be more tolerable with lush green spaces on and around buildings towers with smart shades that follow the movement of the sun roofs and pavements painted with high-albedo surfaces fog capture and renewable energy fields to provide cooling power without adding to the greenhouse effect.But with extremes creeping up faster than baselines, Niyogi says this adapting will require changes not just to the design of cities, but how they are organised and how we live in them. First, though, we have to see what is coming – which might not hit with the fury of a flood or typhoon but can be even more destructive.“Heat is different,” says Niyogi. “You don’t see the temperature creep up to 50C. It can take people unawares.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aefd42a6d8f7d4cb5020856acd8fca9859269e20/0_93_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e254925e93e815b4ea83bdcfc8e13e","title":"heat next big inequality issue heatwaves world","story":"The deadly global heatwave has made it impossible to ignore: in cities worldwide, we are now ided into the cool haves and the hot have-notsby  Amy Fleming with  Ruth Michaelson and Adham Youssef in Cairo,  Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem, Carmela Fonbuena in Manila and Holly Robertson in Phnom PenhWhen July’s heatwave swept through the Canadian province of Quebec, killing more than 90 people in little over a week, the unrelenting sunshine threw the disparities between rich and poor into sharp relief.While the well-heeled residents of Montreal hunkered down in blissfully air conditioned offices and houses, the city’s homeless population – not usually welcome in public areas such as shopping malls and restaurants – struggled to escape the blanket of heat.Benedict Labre House, a day centre for homeless people, wasn’t able to secure a donated air-conditioning unit until five days into the heatwave. “You can imagine when you have 40 or 50 people in an enclosed space and it’s so hot, it’s very hard to deal with,” says Francine Nadler, clinical coordinator at the facility.Fifty-four Montreal residents were killed by this summer’s heat. Authorities haven’t so far specified whether any homeless people were among them, but according to the regional department of public health, the majority were aged over 50, lived alone, and had underlying physical or mental health problems. None had air conditioning. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu told reporters that many of the bodies examined by his team “were in an advanced state of decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat before being found”.It was the poor and isolated who quietly suffered the most in the heat – a situation echoed in overheated cities across the world. In the US, immigrant workers are three times more likely to die from heat exposure than American citizens. In India, where 24 cities are expected to reach average summertime highs of at least 35C (95F) by 2050, it is the slum dwellers who are most vulnerable. And as the global risk of prolonged exposure to deadly heat steadily rises, so do the associated risks of human catastrophe.“Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked,” said lead author Professor Camilo Mora at the time of publication. “It’s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.”The year 2018 is set to be among the hottest since records began, with unprecedented peak temperatures engulfing the planet, from 43C (109F) in Baku, Azerbaijan, to the low 30s across Scandinavia. In Kyoto, Japan, the mercury did not dip below 38C (100F) for a week. In the US, an unusually early and humid July heatwave saw 48.8C (120F) in Chino, inland of Los Angeles. Residents blasted their air conditioners so much they caused power shortages.Urban areas are reaching these killer temperatures faster than those that are less populated. Cities absorb, create and radiate heat. Asphalt, brick, concrete and dark roofs act like sponges for heat during the day and emit warmth at night. Air conditioning is a lifesaver for those who can afford it, but it makes the streets even hotter for those who can’t.“Urban heat islands, combined with an ageing population and increased urbanisation, are projected to increase the vulnerability of urban populations, especially the poor, to heat-related health impacts in the future,” a US government assessment warned.Air pollution is more deadly in these areas, too, as nitrous oxides generate ozone when heated by the sun, inflaming airways and increasing mortality risk. “These problems are worse,” says Benmarhnia, “for vulnerable or low-income populations living near traffic in poor housing with no air conditioning.”But air conditioning will remain out of reach for many, even as it increasingly becomes a necessity. In 2014, Public Health England raised concerns that “the distribution of cooling systems may reflect socioeconomic inequalities unless they are heavily subsidised,” adding that rising fuel costs could further exacerbate this. And when we need to use less energy and cool the planet, not just our homes and offices, relying upon air conditioning is not a viable long-term plan – and certainly not for everyone.Most of the research into heatwaves and public health has focused on western countries Benmarhnia says more studies have been done on the city of Phoenix, Arizona, than the entire continent of Africa. But the problem is global, and especially pronounced across urban slums such as the ashwiyyat in Cairo, where temperatures during the city’s five-month-long summers have peaked at 46C (115F).Um Hamad, 41, works as a cleaner and lives with his family in a small flat in Musturad in the city’s north. Though he considers them lucky to live on the relatively cool first floor, “in Cairo everything is suffocating”, he says. Hamad use fans and water to keep cool inside, but the water bill is becoming expensive . “There’s always that trick of sleeping on the floor, and we wear cotton clothes ,” he says. “The temperatures are harder to deal with for women who wear the hijab, so I always tell my daughters to wear only two layers and to wear bright colours.”In a tight-knit cluster of urban dwellings in Giza, to Cairo’s south, Yassin Al-Ouqba, 42, a train maintenance worker, lives in a house built from a mixture of bricks and mud-bricks. In August, he says, it becomes “like an oven”. “I have a fan and I place it in front of a plate of ice so that it spreads cold air throughout the room. I spread cold water all over the sheets.”In tropical Manila in the Philippines, where highs above 30C are intensified by stifling humidity, air conditioning is a luxury even for those in medical care. The Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital is said to have one of the world’s busiest maternity wards, with free contraception only recently made available in the predominantly Catholic country.An air-conditioned private room costs 650 Philippine pesos per night – less than £10, but far beyond the means of most mothers-to-be, who end up in wards reliant on fans buzzing softly on wall mounts. “These fans work nonstop 24 hours a day, so they never last a year,” says Maribel Bote, a nurse at the hospital for 28 years.The problem is compounded by regular overcrowding: in the maternity ward, known as ground zero of the country’s overpopulation crisis, as many as five mothers have been forced to share one bed. “It gets hellish in the summer – the fans blow hot air,” says Bote. “You’ll see the mothers using paper fans to cool themselves.”In Cambodia, which has seen devastating heatwaves and drought in recent years, surviving the heat is as much a question of status for prisoners as it is for civilians. In the early 2000s Chao Sophea, 30, spent more than two years at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison after being convicted on drug charges, which she denies. At the time she was three months pregnant Sophea’s child spent its first year in an overcrowded cell designated for pregnant women and new mothers.“It was actually a steaming room,” says Sophea today. “I was using a fan made of a palm leaf to cool my baby down – that was what I could afford. There was a tiny hole in the wall, but can you imagine how much air you would absorb in such a crowded space? We made a request for an electric fan, but it never arrived.”An environmental activist who wishes to remain anonymous says he shared a cell of about four square metres with at least 25 other men when he was held in Prey Sar’s men’s wing earlier this year. “We slept like smoked fish on a skewer. There was no air conditioning, not even a fan.”Others may be able to secure better conditions. A 2015 report by the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights stated that “some prisons reportedly house ‘VIP cells’ for well-connected prisoners or those able to pay for single-cell accommodation,” and these are believed to be air conditioned.On a plain north of Amman, some 80,000 Syrians live in the Za’atari refugee camp, a semi-permanent urban settlement set up six years ago and now considered Jordan’s fourth-largest city. Hamda Al-Marzouq, 27, arrived three years ago, fleeing airstrikes on her neighbourhood in the outskirts of Damascus.Her husband had gone missing during the war, and she was desperate to save her young son and extended family. Eight of them now live in a prefabricated shelter, essentially a large metal box, which Al-Marzouq says turns into an oven during the summer.“It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering,” she says by phone from the camp. “We have different ways of coping. We wake in the early morning and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves.” There is no daytime electricity, so fans are useless. When power does arrive at night, the desert has already cooled.Many days, her family will wait until the evening to walk outside, wrapping wet towels around their heads. But the biggest problem are sandstorms, which can arrive violently during the summer months and engulf the camp for days. “We have to close the caravan windows,” she says, adding the room then gets hotter. “It’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them.”Al-Marzouq’s five-year-old son suffers respiratory problems and keeps getting infections, while asthma is rife across the camp.Water has also been an issue, with demand in northern Jordan – one of the most water-scarce countries in the world – surging following the refugee arrivals. A Unicef-led operation will see all households connected to a water network by October, which Al-Marzouq says has been a significant help.“We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with the water network being operational, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water. Now there is equity.”Across the board, lack of equality has been found to feed the urban furnaces. The US researchers who in 2013 uncovered the racial ide in urban heat vulnerability discovered that the more segregated a city was, the hotter it was for everyone. Rachel Morello-Frosch, one of the co-authors, told the LA Times at the time that “this pattern of racial segregation appears to increase everyone’s risk of living in a heat-prone environment”.Treating cities as a whole, ghettos and all, is a more effective way to tackle extreme urban heat, they found. Researchers recommended planting more trees and increasing light-coloured surfaces to reduce the overall heat island effect, adding that urban planning to mitigate future extreme heat “should proactively incorporate an environmental justice perspective and address racialethnic disparities”.Working to break social isolation, says Benmarhnia, “is a win-win situation”, with the added benefit of bringing the “invisible” people most at risk – like the homeless, and illegal immigrants – back into the community, where they can be looked after.In at least one of the world’s hottest countries, steps are starting to be taken. India recently announced that a series of common-sense public health interventions have led to an enormous reduction in heat-related deaths – from 2,040 in 2015, to a little over 200 in 2017. Successful measures included unlocking the gates to public parks during the day, distributing free water, and painting the roofs of slum communities white, knocking 5C off internal temperatures.Montreal first implemented a similar heat action plan in 2004, reducing mortality on hot days by 2.52 deaths per day, but as the heat waves intensify, it is likely that this will need to be reassessed. Nadler says the devastating impacts of global warming are only just beginning to dawn on everyone. “Cities will have to rethink how we prepare for these emergencies and what we’re able to offer to all of our citizens – from the most affluent, to the most vulnerable.”Additional reporting by Ruth Michaelson with Adham Youssef in Cairo, Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem, Carmela Fonbuena in Manila and Holly Robertson in Phnom PenhFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Only then do I feel that Edinburgh can begin its recovery from the annual evisceration it must endure when the international festival is in full spate.Edinburgh is a small smoke and its city centre scarcely covers a few hallowed old streets, but in this little\u0026nbspneighbourhood ceases to be a part of it. This is when it is annexed by an increasingly large travelling circus of braying revellers who simply must have it ticked off on their grand tour. It comes after they’ve jogged through Machu Picchu and before they take selfies with the Terracotta Army.Last week, I wandered through these streets again on my way to an eagerly awaited reunion of former journalist colleagues who worked with me at Scotland on Sunday. Soon, I found myself beset by conflicting emotions as I fought for space in streets thrumming with festivalgoers dashing to complete the list of shows and attractions that simply had to be taken in that day.This time last year, I was elegantly\u0026nbspimportuned by Hans, a gorgeously camp street entertainer clad in stretched, blue gled Lycra who thrust his sleek thigh across my waist as I solicited some words from him for a feature I was writing about the festival fringe. And\u0026nbspfor a few moments I was caught\u0026nbspup in the sheer anarchic exuberance of this event that forces you to laugh out loud as you are stripped of your Scottish Presbyterian self-consciousness. I’ll probably never see big, handsome Hans again but we’ll always have the\u0026nbspRoyal Mile, 2017.At what point does Edinburgh say: “Enough!” or: “This far and no further!”? At what point does it risk ceasing to be Scotland’s most historically important city before tipping over fully to become known as a latter-day vaudeville town something that exists in the imaginations of its overseas visitors as a swollen theme park for high-end stag parties and multitudes of people seeking an “experience” while deluding themselves that they are tasting culture? We must be pretty close to it.The Edinburgh international festival is actually several festivals, including the fringe, the military tattoo, the book festival and the television festival. In recent years, an art festival has been added and a festival of politics, where some journalists (and a few who pretend to be) disappear up each other’s fundaments discussing Brexit and independence and agreeing to write blurbs for each other’s books (or collections of essays, as they’re called these days). How many budding authors now dream not of having their book published but of reading from it at a book festival?Certainly, there are always diamonds to be found in Edinburgh\u0026nbspduring August and opportunities to witness proper intellectuals and cultural giants discussing their work and sharing their methods. How much of this creative output can ever find its mark, though, when people approach it like competitors in a pie-eating contest or an all-inclusive package holiday? I’ve often wondered how much of a truly wonderful theatrical or musical experience can really be appreciated if it has to fight for space in your brain with dozens of other experiences that have to be “consumed” in a short space of time.A few years ago, I was privileged to listen to the wonderful English novelist Howard Jacobson not only discussing his latest work but also talking intimately about the way he tries to structure his books and add depth to his characters. It was refreshingly free from artifice and cant and more than a few in the audience seemed disappointed when he said that quite often he doesn’t actually have a plan for his novels, but that one emerges when he starts writing.Afterwards, I met some former colleagues who had also attended the event and hoped to hear their thoughts on what they had just heard. However, the Jacobson event was only part of a whistlestop itinerary for them that day, which included several other book events, a comedy show and a late-night play\u0026nbsp(being a self-aware sort of a chiel, I haven’t discounted the possibility that they feared me boring the tits off them and simply wanted to make a quick getaway).I’m not about to ponder here on the concept of how you define good art and culture. Once in a while, though, you encounter a play or a concert or an exhibition that becomes a companion to your thoughts over the following few days or weeks and helps you form a deeper appreciation of the people\u0026nbspand places you were previously accustomed to dismissing or ignoring.Thus art and culture become part of the normal chain of events that form an ordinary life, entering now and then to make them seem less ordinary. At the Edinburgh festivals, these moments are choked\u0026nbspat birth in the stampede for others. In this way, something beautiful and\u0026nbspprofound can be rendered inane and shallow.There was a time when I wanted Glasgow to host its own festival as a means of driving investment and tourism in my city now I’m not so sure. Here, we value our galleries, our opera house, our theatres and our concert venues, but I hope we never fetishise them. Here, they exist to educate and to enkindle imaginations all year round by being a natural part of the city they quietly invite us in from time to time they don’t deafen us or ask us to make of them a graven image."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e717e587e56f485cc2d8ecc9dffe6bcedb537df/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dfc5c77b42cfdb982f58fb24dc52adf","title":"councils austerity outsourcing northamptonshire barnet","story":"The people running an arm of the British state confessed last week that they can no longer do their job.

Tried out here and there for decades, in the past few years pulverism has gone nationwide. Aiding and abetting and cheering it on have been the biggest beasts in Conservatism. Under this regime, financial mismanagement isn’t opposed to austerity – but feeds upon it, as local officials hand over taxpayer cash to “project managers” on eye-watering day rates and any passing huckster in pinstripes. It leads to town halls being looted by multinationals for millions, even while adults with learning disabilities are turfed out of their homes to save pennies. If this sounds familiar that’s because what is playing out in local government is an extreme version of the story still unfolding in Whitehall. And one of the best places to see it is on the northern outskirts of the capital.The London borough of Barnet is the alpha and omega of pulverism. It was a role model for Northamptonshire, and the two are eerily similar. Both true blue Tory both preaching the need for sound finances while raiding their contingency funds and refusing to raise council taxes both happy to chuck millions at consultants and build themselves swanky headquarters. And, crucially, both adamant that their council’s future lies in smashing itself up and handing out the shards to big companies to provide the bulk of public services.Barnet’s Tories raced down this road even before the\u0026nbsp2008 financial crash, eventually unveiling the “easyCouncil” model. Just as Cameron’s big alibi was that wretched note from Labour’s Liam Byrne, saying “there’s no money left”, so Barnet brandished a “graph of doom” showing its budgetary crunch. Bringing in the private sector – in particular the FTSE giant Capita, which snared two vast 10-year contracts worth about £500m – was meant to be the fix. It would ensure better public services for less money.Wrong on both counts. Under outsourcing, basic bits of local administration are now a bad joke. Barnet’s pensions are in such a state that last year the regulator fined Capita for not filing essential information on time. Roads, also managed by Capita, are so potholed that they became a big issue in the May elections. Recently a Capita employee working for Barnet was jailed for 62 instances of fraud worth a total of £2m. He had violated financial controls for well over a year, yet the council admitted to me that the crimes were spotted neither by it nor by Capita, but by the employee’s own bank.All of this is costing not less money, but more. Just how much more not even the council’s leaders are clear. The Tories went into the May elections boasting of the borough’s financial stability the next month they confessed to a black hole of £62m by the middle of next decade. To stave off ruin, the axe will be wielded again.Both Barnet and Capita claim that outsourcing has delivered “significant financial savings”. That is doubtless true on the core work contracted out – but outsourcing companies always make their money by charging for extras. Resident and blogger John Dix reviews the invoices submitted by Capita under the outsourcing contracts (256 for the last financial year alone) and can tell you what those extras typically include.

Take the £24m spent on management consultants primarily to draw up the plans for outsourcing, or the running total of £90m that Barnet has since shelled out on agency and temp workers: how many school dinners, carers for older residents or council houses could that have paid for?Instead, that money has been spent on projects that served as a launchpad for a handful of careers, such as Mike Freer who as Barnet leader came up with the easyCouncil model and is today a Tory whip in the Commons.

But the industry in fleecing gig-goers is still a going concernRegular gig-goers will welcome Ticketmaster’s decision to scrap its two “secondary” resale sites, GetMeIn and Seatwave, both of which have become havens for armchair ticket touts looking to fleece fans. Ticket brokers – as the biggest touts prefer to be known – deploy a variety of nefarious techniques to harvest tickets in bulk as soon as they go on sale, before flogging them at eye-watering mark-ups on secondary platforms. The websites take their cut too, meaning everybody wins but the people who actually have an emotional connection with the music that generates the money. It’s a broken market that has been allowed to spread unchecked, so the disappearance of two of the big four resale sites – leaving just StubHub and Viagogo still plying their trade – is surely good news. But the reception should be the ripple of polite applause from music fans that greets an esoteric new track, rather than the rapturous whooping reserved for a well-known banger from everyone’s favourite album.For a start, GetMeIn and Seatwave represent the more responsible end of the resale market. Unlike Viagogo, both bowed to pressure from politicians, the competition authorities and the music industry to comply with consumer protection laws. This gave fans more information about what they were buying and made it easier to identify professional touts holding more tickets than they could feasibly have purchased via legitimate channels. The fact that both sites are owned by Ticketmaster – itself owned by global promoter and venue operator Live Nation – also meant they were more likely to agree an armistice on resale when big acts with global clout required it. For instance, both honoured Ed Sheeran’s ban on resale for his recent tour. Viagogo ignored the singer-songwriter’s request and thousands of disappointed Sheeranites saw their tickets cancelled. With two of the biggest players out of the way, StubHub and the industry’s bad boy, Viagogo, could now pick up business from touts with a shrinking range of options. There remains a question mark over Ticketmaster’s long-term strategy, too. Its immediate plan is to launch a fan-to-fan ticket exchange that only sells seats at face value or below, much like existing services such as Twickets. But Ticketmaster has long felt that by keeping ticket prices at affordable levels, the world’s biggest artists are leaving money on the table. The company’s contention is that touts end up collecting that cash by exploiting resale platforms. There is merit in that argument – but it doesn’t mean Ticketmaster wants fans to keep hold of that excess cash. Like any corporate entity, their job is to maximise revenue. There are several ways of doing this. One is Ticketmaster Platinum, a controversial “premium” service that drip-feeds tickets into the market for hundreds of pounds after fans have been told that gigs are sold out. In fact, Ticketmaster has kept some seats back, exploiting the resulting desperation among fans to jack up prices.These seats are usually among the best in the house, to be fair. But when approached by the , Ticketmaster refused to say whether buyers could end up sitting next to somebody who paid ordinary face value when tickets first went on sale. Platinum is ripe for expansion and could well fill some of the void vacated by GetMeIn and Seatwave.And then there’s dynamic pricing, which Ticketmaster has long been testing in the US. Under this system, prices fluctuate depending on demand. Theoretically, that could mean great bargains when gigs don’t sell out. But for the most in-demand shows, the laws of supply and demand could herald sky-high prices as fans scrabble for seats, ratcheting up the average price-per-head at venues, often operated by Ticketmaster’s parent company, Live Nation. Many fans will feel that dynamic pricing is touting by another name, albeit with greater consumer guarantees. Some acts will want to ensure prices stay relatively low for altruistic reasons, not to mention the long-term commercial incentive of keeping fans sweet. That will mean relying on new ticket technology to limit touting and ensure fans get tickets on a balloted, or first-come-first-served basis. Others will look to squeeze whatever they can out of the consumer. If venues fill up with indifferent audiences dipping into corporate entertainment budgets for a night out, the music scene is sure to suffer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22ee43895ea54569c02e3c354ac3c8b45d0a0da8/276_0_3583_2150/master/3583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7619dc3062064df27b614a60fbb30e6","title":"a level gcse grades handed fairly ofqual reassured","story":"Students are reassured they will not be disadvantaged by sitting ‘tougher’ examsThe chief qualifications regulator in England, Sally Collier, said that this year’s A-level and GCSE students would not suffer from being the first to take the new, tougher, exams.Collier, head of the Ofqual assessment watchdog, sought to reassure parents and students – as hundreds of thousands of families anxiously awaited the publication of this summer’s A-level and GCSE results – saying that although the new exams were more testing, the final grades would be fairly distributed and in the same way as in previous years.This Thursday (16 August) the results for A-levels will be published, including more than 20 of the tougher versions of the exam. They will be followed by GCSEs the following week in which the familiar letter grades from A-G are replaced by the numbers 9-1 in many subjects.Dismissing suggestions that students taking the exams this summer were “guinea pigs”, Collier said: “There has been commentary that the exams were harder – and, truly, students have been studying more challenging content. That was the government’s policy intention in reforming these qualifications. But the approach we adopt, known as comparable outcomes, means that students aren’t disadvantaged relative to students in previous years just by being the first cohort to sit the new qualifications.”For some parents it may be the first time they have seen letter grades replaced by numbers in GCSEs, with 9 representing the previous top A* grade and 1 equating to G. Instead of C as the acknowledged grade for a good pass, the reformed GCSEs will award a 4 or 5, with the higher number regarded as a “strong pass”.“All things being equal, a student who would have got a C or above in their GCSE last year will get a four or above this year,” Collier said.Last year students sat reformed GCSEs in English and maths for the first time, while this summer students were tested on a wider range of 20 reformed subjects.Ofqual and the exam boards in England use a process known as comparable outcomes to fix the proportion of grades awarded in both qualifications based on prior attainment. At A-level the outcomes are set using the year-groups’ GCSE results two years’ previously, while at GCSE the proportions are based on tests taken at the end of primary school five years ago.“Our message is one of continuity,” Collier said. “As standards are set in new qualifications this summer the use of comparable outcomes means that if the students taking them are of similar ability to those taking them last year then national outcomes in the reformed qualifications will be steady.” The reformed qualifications – part of the overhaul ordered by Michael Gove as education secretary – mainly rely on exam results for determining a final grade, rather than classroom assessment carried out by teachers. Meanwhile, the halfway module for A-levels, the AS-level exam, has been decoupled, meaning that A-level grades no longer include AS results.The reforms only apply to A-levels and GCSEs in England. The results for those in Wales and Northern Ireland will be published at the same time but they are regulated differently and are unaffected.Collier said Ofqual used social media to monitor allegations that the tougher exams were causing greater amounts of stress for this year’s pupils, comparing posts this year to last year.“The pattern of social media activity relating to exams, over the exam period, is extraordinarily similar,” Collier said. “After every single subject, I don’t think we had a single exam where the vast majority or the majority of students came out and said ‘this was impossible’ or ‘this was too hard’. Actually, the comments were very, very, balanced.”The exam overhaul is thought likely to benefit boys, who appear to do better under stressful exam environments, rather than girls, who in the past did better from longer periods of assessment.Alan Smithers, a professor of education at Buckingham university, noted that boys improved their results relative to girls in each of the 13 reformed A-level exams last summer, and expected to see a similar performance this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf6ac0a2301c06e71e3d8ac82a3561a62efc5fa/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=489073e644d07a3a67f89de4d943e1d0","title":"blackkklansman spik lee hollywood ku klux klan","story":"Spike Lee’s latest film, about a black detective infiltrating the Klan, once again raises the issue of how seriously cinema should take the white supremacist groupThe movies have never quite been sure how seriously to take the Ku Klux Klan. Is it a terrorist organisation, or a glorified frat society for resentful losers who like dressing up in silly costumes? Over the decades, cinema has given us both versions, and a few more besides.Incredible as its truth-based story is, Spike Lee’s latest joint BlacKkKlansman is not the first time an African American has infiltrated the KKK in the movies. In Ted V Mikels’s 1966 trashsploitationer The Black Klansman (AKA I Cross the Colour Line), a light-skinned black jazz musician goes undercover to bring down Alabama racists (although technically the hero is played by a white actor, Richard Gilden). In 1974, OJ Simpson donned the pointy hood to mete out revenge in The Klansman while Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder also gatecrash the baddies’ gang in Mel Brooks’s satirical western Blazing Saddles.The movies bear their own responsibility for the KKK in the first place, of course: specifically DW Griffiths’s notorious The Birth of a Nation, which gave the virtually defunct Klan of the 1910s a fresh creation myth, a blockbuster recruitment film, and some new ritual suggestions (the movie popularised cross-burning). Hollywood has been trying to atone ever since. On the one hand, we have had serious dramas on Klan-inflicted violence, such as Mississippi Burning, A Time to Kill and last year’s Mudbound. We have also had more fanciful action movies in which the heroes vanquish the Klan. The Klansman (which starred Richard Burton and Lee Marvin) was one 1976 blaxploitation flick Brotherhood of Death another (three black Vietnam vets take up arms against the KKK) and 1966 spaghetti western Django yet another (Franco Nero singlehandedly guns down a Klan-like Confederate mob).Post-civil rights era, though, the enfeebled Klan moved into the realms of ridicule. It wasn’t just Blazing Saddles: the KKK were the butt of the joke in 80s comedies Fletch Lives and Porky’s II, plus Richard Pryor’s Bustin’ Loose and The Toy. George Clooney and co stumble into a Klan lynching that’s choreographed like a Busby Berkeley number in O Brother Where Art Thou? And in Tarantino’s Django Unchained, an amateurish Klan posse argue over the restrictiveness of their home-made hoods.Perhaps, though, it is time to stop laughing again. BlacKkKlansman ridicules the 1970s Klan’s paranoia and stupidity, but ends with sobering documentary footage of torch-bearing racists marching last year in Charlottesville, with no need for hoods, and former Klan bigwig David Duke once again being taken seriously. Does ridicule defuse extremism, or could it be that the Klan’s humiliation has fuelled resentment? Should we laugh or cry? BlacKkKlansman suggests both, which seems about right. BlacKkKlansman is in UK cinemas from 24 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7226c4263224dc88a4611b1f6884f4a5c1ea8bb/0_60_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45dd9267bc9fae178dbf95ee8ae1b542","title":"crazy rich asians review kevin kwan","story":"The adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s bestselling novel is both a fun culture clash comedy and a watershed moment for representation in HollywoodWith a premise straight from classic literature and fairy tales, Crazy Rich Asians is a transportive romcom about a poor girl who finds her Prince Charming – and is then thrown into the extravagant, glitzy, catty world of the Singapore elite.The idea that an everyday woman could meet a dashing man and end up marrying into aristocratic society is a well-worn, and well-loved, story convention that has built the foundation for tales like Pride and Prejudice and Cinderella. And these stories have roots in real-life fascination – it’s estimated that 1.9 billion people tuned in to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding. Crazy Rich Asians plays well into the trappings of this framework: the story floats between gaudy and flirtatious to emotional, dramatic and then eye-opening and heartwarming by its conclusion. It’s a film that’s entirely aware it’s an ornate fantasy, one meant to whisk you away to a land of unspeakably fine dresses, banquets and baubles. It’s also a film that just so happens to feature an Asian cast.It’s hard to underestimate the importance of this. Last year, only four out of the 100 top-grossing films featured an Asian protagonist. While films like Dev Patel’s Lion and Kumail Nanjiani’s The Big Sick have been met with critical acclaim, it’s been 25 years since a major Hollywood studio has funded a present day film that features an entirely Asian, Asian American and diaspora Asian cast, with the last instance being 1993’s The Joy Luck Club. While Crazy Rich Asians’ rags-to-riches story is, at its core, one with universal appeal, Hollywood is still using the film to gauge whether it should even greenlight more Asian-centric projects. The film boasts over 70 speaking roles for Asian actors, and director Jon MChu and author Kevin Kwan spent so long searching for talent that they now have what they believe is the largest database of English-speaking Asian actors. It would not be far off to say this is a watershed moment, for both Hollywood and everyone involved in the project.The film itself is a faithful adaptation of Kwan’s international best-selling novel by the same name. It centers on Rachel (Constance Wu), a plucky NYU economics professor who teaches game theory and has a dreamy historian boyfriend named Nick Young (Malaysian-born Henry Golding, in his debut acting role). Rachel accompanies Nick to Singapore for his best friend’s wedding, and it’s there she learns that Nick is actually the son of the wealthiest family on the island, heir to the dynasty, and the wedding they’re attending is the hottest event of the year. Nick does little to prepare her for what awaits – a gilded lion’s den, where socialites will drop millions on jewelry without batting a lifted eyelash, and yet turn their noses up at Rachel’s job, her nationality and her status as the child of a single mother (played by Kheng Hua Tan).This distinction between Asian and Asian American is a conversation we’ve rarely seen in mainstream films, and one of the interesting things about Crazy Rich Asians is how the fully Asian cast allows for these intercommunity conversations to get teased out. Despite her best efforts to impress, Rachel immediately finds herself at odds with Nick’s mother Eleanor Young (Michelle Yeoh), a matriarch steeped in tradition and duty who finds Rachel’s Americanness wholly distasteful. “You’re a foreigner ... all Americans care about is their own happiness,” Eleanor says to her. That Rachel has no longstanding cultural roots in any country, worked her way up from nothing and speaks of keeping her job were she to marry Nick, all single her out as an outsider, someone who is Asian, yet not, in all the ways that matter. Cinematographer Vanja Cernjul captures the most delightfully exquisite details of this secretive world – the wedding, in particular, had me in near tears – but visuals aside, the film is at its best when it explores the interior lives of women. Yeoh and Wu spark off each other, with Rachel’s more wide-eyed optimism running up against Eleanor’s steely grace that hides a deep love for her family. Malaysian-born TV writer Adele Lim was brought in to add specificity and emotional beats to Peter Chiarelli’s script, and you can see her hand in the way these women interact across cultural boundaries. There’s also Gemma Chan as Nick’s cousin Astrid, an ethereal, kind socialite who does her best to protect Rachel but is wrapped up in dealing with her own husband’s perceived inferiorities. Awkwafina’s Peik Lin is similarly a highlight, a shamelessly nouveau riche character whose friendship with Rachel is genuine and unquestioning. Nick and his friend Colin (Chris Pang), meanwhile, are largely there to be eye-candy.When one looks at the film’s 102 minute runtime, it’s hard not to mourn its brevity. It’s impossible for such airy summer fare to delve much deeper than it does into the moral pitfalls of this society. It’s a gauzy fantasy, one that never purports to be anything more than a glimpse through the curtains at an intensely insular world, the one percent of the one percent. There could be conversations about whether this story glorifies capitalism, or extravagance, or peddles only one specific image of what “Asian” means. At the same time, it’s unfair that the systemic injustices in Hollywood have saddled a romcom, of all things, with the burden of needing to be everything for everyone. Was Princess Diaries expected to explore colonialism, or Ocean’s 8 asked to expound on the dangers of glorifying organized crime? So infrequently do Asian women get to see themselves in spaces like Downton Abbey, as the Lizzie Bennets, Belles or Guineveres. Of 2017’s four films that featured an Asian protagonist, not one of them was a woman. Crazy Rich Asians is not a perfect film, but it has the potential to open doors for more Asian-led projects. And it’s a film that, for once, allows Asian women to just slide the glass slipper on, even for a moment.

Here’s a crash course in what to expect from your new leagueWelcome, talented football player from Abroad! As one of our age-old sayings goes: to be signed to an English Premier League side is to win first prize in the lottery of life. There is some dispute as to whether you now play in the biggest league on earth, or the best league on Earth, or the richest league on Earth, or the most relentlessly self-dramatising league on Earth. But you almost definitely play in the somethingest league on Earth. Congrats!Crucially, you’ve decided to ply your trade in the country that was most instrumental in winning the second world war. What do you mean, you thought you’d just played a World Cup there this summer? No. Not at all. Please don’t make that mistake again. Perfectly naturally, the war is still a big part of top-flight football over here, and the likely first flashpoint for you to navigate will come in the buildup to Remembrance Day in November.It has long has been deemed that the most respectful way to honour those who died to ensure our freedom is to spend the month in advance screamingly policing whether this club – or indeed that club – is going to embroider a poppy into its strip for the fixtures closest to that date. Of course, even after that, the illusion of choice remains – you, player from another land, can choose to opt out of wearing the poppied strip.And that’s totally cool. All that will happen is a journalist from the Daily  or Daily Mail will find out what country you come from, and write 1,500 words on what they didn’t do in the war. Uruguay? URUGUAY?! They didn’t do anything in the war. Did plenty after it, if you know what I mean. (If you don’t know what they mean, don’t worry, because there will be a little fact box to jazz up the article, explaining exactly what they mean.) Furthermore, you will be unable to so much as visit the supermarket without having a photographer almost literally up in your grill, providing pictures to accompany more #content suggesting that you insult our war dead.On a related note, don’t make even a minor fuss about anything to do with your job anywhere near one of the dates of the major battles in the first world war. You will discover that the most reasonable point many will care to make in rejoinder is that you would have been crap at the Somme, or Ypres, or whatever it is. So decide how much you mind about fixture congestion, or whatever it is. And then decide whether you’d mind more about standing two foot deep in mud, in a trench, having not slept since March. If the answer’s yes, keep your gently-voiced criticism in the vault.Anyway: fixture congestion. One of the most insane things about your new homeland is that you may be required to play in the Premier League a mere 48 hours before you might be required to play in the Champions League. I know! Crazy. They’re basically asking you to pull a sporting all-nighter. You’re like the Keith Richards of football. Will it kill you? There’s simply not enough research currently available to be sure. Still: make a will before you undertake this for the first time.Speaking of the fixture list, do you like Christmas? Oh dear. Not only will you be playing on Boxing Day, but you may be at one of the clubs whose early-December run of form is so unsatisfactory that you will learn – again from the newspapers – that the manager has “cancelled Christmas”.Other quirks? At most places of work, someone showing you the ropes will murmur: “Oh that’s Pete, he’s been there a long time, he goes off on one a lot but no one takes any notice.” Our Pete is José Mourinho. You need to understand that everyone is completely bored with his nonsense, and will consequently talk about him more than anything else, including their own families, for as long as he’s around.The average emotional age of a press-conferencing Premier League manager is 12. Given that someone like Jürgen Klopp’s emotional age is his actual age, you need to think what that means about the lower end of the scale.So all that remains of our crash course is vocabulary. Don’t worry. Given it’s your third language, your English will be excellent, but you will still be foxed by terms such as “on the brink” and “mind games”. The trick to these is that the words in them don’t mean what those words usually mean. Take “the brink”. The brink can be vast, easily dwarfing the Arctic shelf. It can take months to traverse the brink. The aforementioned Mourinho was sighted on the brink a couple of weeks ago – but he could be there for some time.So those are the basics. Regard them all as charming idiosyncrasies, or be judged as having failed to “settle”. I know the badges say something different, but the real motto of every Premier League club is exactly the same. “It’s not us it’s you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645abf70b8d75f67afbe205c34d205b85bdf7cbb/0_211_2737_1642/master/2737.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f061659db0e7eb59fc4681efc054b380","title":"liverpool west ham premier league","story":"Georginio Wijnaldum has said he relishes increased competition in Liverpool’s midfield and never entertained the idea of leaving Anfield this summer.The Dutch international carried his fine pre-season form into Sunday’s 4-0 win over West Ham as Jürgen Klopp’s team recorded the biggest opening day win at Anfield since 1932.Wijnaldum was linked with a move to Turkey after Liverpool had spent over £90m to add Naby Keïta and Fabinho to their central midfield options. But the 27-year-old welcomes the inevitable pressure for places and was not responsible for the transfer speculation.“I laughed about it,” Wijnaldum said. “I also read I asked the club if I could leave. I never had a conversation with the club. People from the outside just see Liverpool are buying players, so players who are already here are going to leave. Liverpool will always buy good players, even if they already have good players. That’s normal.The strength of Klopp’s squad was underlined by the Liverpool bench against West Ham, with Daniel Sturridge, Xherdan Shaqiri and Jordan Henderson all introduced in the second half, while Fabinho and Adam Lallana unused.Wijnaldum believes that will be key to challenging Manchester City for the title. “I think we have the quality to compete with them but I also thought we had the quality last season. If City are going to play like they did last season then it will be really hard because they only lost two games and had a few draws.“If you want to compete with them you can barely drop points. That’s really difficult but something we look forward to because you want to compete with the others and City are one of the best. So we will go for it.”Wijnaldum was also impressed with the league debut of Keïta, who helped create the opening goal for Mohamed Salah and settled immediately in midfield. “He has a lot of qualities. He can provide assists, he can score goals. He showed it in Germany. He can keep the ball and give us – I don’t want to say time to rest – but time to keep the ball as a team. I think he can regain the ball, his counterpressing is good. I think he’s a good signing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f9d989198cc94ef0ff3f848907592541cf6f71d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b5c27fd8b190bd03faa55e7880c395","title":"premier league 10 talking points weekend action","story":"Guendouzi is one of Arsenal’s few reasons to be cheerful, Naby Keïta is a thrilling talent no matter whose shirt he’s wearing, and Richarlison already looks worth the moneyWherever Arsène Wenger was watching, he would have approved of Mattéo Guendouzi’s presence at the base of Arsenal’s midfield. The 19-year-old was poached from Lorient, exactly the type of under‑the-radar Francophone deal in which the former manager delighted. Eager and energetic, his tousled locks and upright style make him stand out but, with City interchanging midfield passes at breakneck speed, Unai Emery had exposed him to a heavy workload – neither Granit Xhaka nor Aaron Ramsey showed much dedication to defensive duties. When Raheem Sterling blazed past him to score City’s opener, Guendouzi’s inexperience was exposed but so was neglectful defending from Mesut Özil and Héctor Bellerín. His passing was often chaotic but so was that of his midfield partners, particularly Xhaka. John BrewinEddie Howe is the longest-serving manager in the ision. While that fact is a damning indictment of the world of management, it is another marker of Bournemouth’s steady progress. Last weekend marked 10 years since Bournemouth were handed a 17-point deduction in the fourth tier, and Howe is determined not to stand still. He has cited the importance of building a new stadium and training ground to establish a legacy from this era. Howe’s side made light work of Cardiff City, with the new signings Jefferson Lerma and Diego Rico still to be integrated. David Brooks showcased an elegance on his debut, while Ryan Fraser is determined to be more influential this campaign. “Ryan did well for us last year and as the season got going he really came into is own,” Howe said. “He’s a real talent and he can take confidence from this game.” Ben FisherThis contest was billed as a first glimpse of Fulham’s new-look squad on their Premier League return, and ended with Wilfried Zaha condemning the host side to defeat.

Aaron Wan-Bissaka was outstanding in direct confrontation with Ryan Sessegnon. The 20-year-old, sent off on his England Under-20 debut in the spring, allied pace, power and defensive surety with an assist thrown in for good measure on his eighth top‑flight appearance. Wan-Bissaka’s first three direct opponents at this level had been Christian Eriksen, Alexis Sánchez and Eden Hazard last season. “It was almost sink or swim and he learned to swim very quickly,” Roy Hodgson said. That duel of Sessegnon versus Wan-Bissaka will have had Gareth Southgate purring. Dominic FifieldSince he arrived at Huddersfield, David Wagner has pushed the idea of his team as “little dogs”, the unfancied upstarts snapping at the big boys’ heels. That was fine while gunning for their unlikely promotion and even more unlikely survival in the Premier League, but one wonders how much longer he can get away with it without creating a defeatist attitude. Wagner almost brushed off the 3-0 defeat against Chelsea on Saturday – “There is no reason to have your head down, or to overthink this result,” he told his players – but is it healthy to perpetuate the idea that they essentially have no chance against teams such as Chelsea? Particularly a Chelsea team that is in flux, getting used to a new manager and style? Sooner or later Huddersfield will have to start acting like they belong in the Premier League, rather than being plucky interlopers just grateful to be there. Nick MillerOf all the players who impressed for Liverpool, Sky’s Jamie Redknapp was particularly smitten by Naby Keïta. “The number eight really seems to suit him,” he said. “He’s not overawed by playing in the Steven Gerrard number.” No player has worn that shirt at Liverpool since Gerrard left in 2015, and although Keïta’s father was a fan who will no doubt have spoken to his son about the club’s famous occasions, the idea that a man who was 10 when Liverpool won the Champions League in Istanbul would be remotely awed by what is no more than a numerical coincidence is absurd. Gerrard will not quickly be forgotten at Liverpool but to endlessly compare him with the club’s rotating cast of central midfielders, particularly when the only apparent similarity between them is the number on their back, helps nobody. Keïta did play very well, though. Simon BurntonThe tension created between José Mourinho and Ed Woodward this summer over the abandoned pursuit of a centre‑back seems a little unnecessary given the encouraging performances of Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf against Leicester. But also because the obvious defensive deficiency at Manchester United lies elsewhere, and has done for some time. Despite his desire to leave – there is interest from Serie A – and Mourinho’s apparent distrust in his ability, Matteo Darmian started at right-back and was given an uncomfortable evening by Demarai Gray and Ben Chilwell at Old Trafford. Antonio Valencia’s calf injury should soon heal but the Ecuadorian is 33 and has been a stop-gap measure for five years. Diogo Dalot is the third option but, at 19, made just eight first‑team appearances for Porto before his £24m sale. James PiercyThree fine deliveries into the area prefaced three headed goals. If anyone needed reminding that good crosses can win games it was abundantly clear here as Newcastle’s failure to defend stellar balls from Christian Eriksen (a corner) and Serge Aurier (a cross) led to Jan Vertonghen and then Dele Alli scoring for a slightly fortunate Spurs. Joselu briefly levelled after connecting with Matt Ritchie’s left-foot, right-wing dispatch. Ritchie was subsequently furious at being replaced by Christian Atsu and had a mini tantrum. It reflected the mood of the crowd, some of whom had earlier in the day been among the 500 demonstrators protesting against Mike Ashley’s stewardship of the club outside a city-centre branch of his Sports Direct chain, demanding he sells up. The big problem with that is that Ashley needs to find a buyer first. Louise TaylorNot signing players is the new black. Sure Spurs have the crown, but Burnley did not do too badly in the summer window, adding only three recruits (for just under £30m, not much money in today’s top flight, as ridiculous as that may seem). Tried and trusted names did the job for Burnley against Southampton, and players who have been in the shadows at Turf Moor led the way. Ashley Westwood and Jeff Hendrick allied strength with awareness and good technical play in the middle, and Stephen Ward was a reliable outlet on the left. But it was particularly great to see Aaron Lennon racing down the right flank. The former England man’s dribbling and distribution were consistently good and he might have decided the game had he put his breakaway shot past Alex McCarthy in the first half. Buying players is exciting, but coaching the best out of them must be the fun bit. Paul MacInnesIt is a little over a year since Watford paid a club-record fee of £18.5m to sign Andre Gray from Burnley and it is fair to say the 27-year-old has yet to justify the outlay. He scored just five times in 33 appearances last season and had Watford signed the striker most of their supporters were craving this summer it is possible he would have departed from Vicarage Road by now. But they did not and Gray remained. More than that, he is starting games, playing alongside Troy Deeney in Saturday’s 2-0 victory over Brighton having also linked up with the Watford captain during pre-season. Neither of them scored but they performed well, with Gray a lively presence. There was a sharpness to his movement that suggests a player who has been dogged by difficulties may be in the right shape, physically as well as mentally, to finally flourish for Javi Gracia’s side. Sachin NakraniMarco Silva was at pains to say the £40m Everton shelled out for Richarlison was “not important” but the 21-year-old’s debut at Molineux suggested he may quickly prove to be worth every penny. The Brazilian won the free-kick from which he jabbed in Everton’s opener and then finished wonderfully to put their 10 men in reach of an unlikely win. It did not come to pass, but his performance suggested he will be a leading figure in Silva’s side. It is worth remembering that Richarlison – albeit a year younger and fresh from Fluminense – could not sustain his early form for Watford last season. Silva said his player needs greater protection from referees but also admitted he is “here to teach Richarlison in the right moments what he has to do, and not simulate anything”. The broader point, though, is Everton have a thrilling prospect on their hands.

A group of young men stub out cigarettes and pause conversation, squinting as they pull their shirts up over their mouths and noses. An elderly woman shuffles along the road towards me. She meets my eye then nods up to the haze above, a brown-grey cloud masking the normally Pacific-blue sky. This is Ambae, one of 83 islands comprising Vanuatu. The island is home to Monaro Voui, an active volcano that has sent plumes of thick smoke and ash into the air over the past 11 months, prompting a complete evacuation of the island last September. Residents returned a month later when the activity settled but the authorities have this month ordered another mandatory evacuation when monitoring revealed the chance of an eruption.The dust sneaks into fresh water supplies and covers gardens, reducing the quality and yield of food crops. It gathers on rooftops and changes the coastline appearance. Once rocky coastlines are now black sand beaches, an ominous symbol of the volcano’s power and energy.In April, villagers from high up on the volcano descended the mountain to sea-level evacuation centres inside church buildings and schools. Last month, the ash blocked out the sun completely, sending residents scrambling for torches in the middle of the day.The government’s evacuation notice means residents have to relocate within a week to nearby Maewo, providing incentives such as free transport, food contributions and health services. But many prefer to go to Santo, Vanuatu’s second-biggest island. Maewo is still at risk of ashfall, some tell me. Others admit Santo presents better opportunities for earning a living and the opportunity to be closer to family.I’m in Lonae, West Ambae where families are packing up their belongings for a second time in a year. As dawn breaks, small piles of boxes and belongings slowly appear on the beach and by 10am, a large crowd has gathered. This group has decided to go to Santo and word has it a ship funded by the Mormon church is due to arrive. The mood doesn’t feel exactly sombre. A young man plays guitar while children laugh and play on the sand. It’s clear the evacuation is considered a temporary measure for many.Eventually the ship arrives, anchoring two hundred metres offshore, and a small boat begins the cycle of trips back and forth. The disabled, sick and elderly board first. Women and children second. Finally, on perhaps the tenth trip, men board the boat. A dog swims furiously, chasing its owner, but eventually gives up and circles back to land.The scene is duplicated on East Ambae the following day, this time with a much larger ship headed to Maewo and officiated by a local policeman. I end up on the boat and this time the mood is tense. The evacuees cast their eyes back toward Ambae as we pull away from the island, uncertain what lies ahead and what will happen to the homes they have left behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57f6ab2c15657b60b7be2a947300dc7c4dd2491b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1f90719ce13edd17b9b25c93b2470d2","title":"ticketmaster shut seatwave getmein resale secondary ticketing","story":"Controversial secondary ticketing sites will be replaced by fan-to-fan exchangeTicketmaster is to shut down its two resale sites, GetMeIn and Seatwave, following persistent criticism of “secondary ticketing” platforms used by touts.The ticketing company, owned by the global promoter and venue operator Live Nation, said it would replace the websites with a fan-to-fan exchange selling tickets at face value or below.The move leaves Viagogo and StubHub, the offices of both of which were raided last year by the Competition and Markets Authority in an investigation into breaches of consumer law, as the last two major resale platforms.Secondary ticketing sites have been criticised for making it easy for professional touts to charge huge markups for artists such as Adele and Ed Sheeran, after harvesting tickets for face-value prices at the expense of fans.After the sites close down in October, fans will be able to resell tickets on Ticketmaster for no more than the original price plus booking fee. No new events will be listed on the sites from 13 August. Fans buying tickets through Ticketmaster will be given clear information about whether they are purchasing resold tickets.The Ticketmaster UK managing director, Andrew Parsons, said: “We know that fans are tired of seeing tickets being snapped up just to find them being resold for a profit on secondary websites, so we have taken action.“Closing down our secondary sites and creating a ticket exchange on Ticketmaster has always been our long-term plan. We’re excited to launch our redesigned website, which will make buying and selling tickets fast and simple, with all tickets in the same place.“Our new Ticketmaster ticket exchange lets fans sell tickets they can’t use directly through their Ticketmaster account, for the price originally paid or less.”While many of the people using these sites are genuine fans who cannot attend an event and want to recoup their money, the practice has in recent years become increasingly dominated by a relatively small group of “armchair” touts. These traders use a variety of methods, some exposed in previous  reporting, to harvest hundreds of tickets before genuine fans can get hold of them.Digital and creative industries Minister Margot James welcomed the move, saying in a statement: “We want real fans to be able to see their favourite artists and events at a fair price. This is a welcome move from Ticketmaster and shows that they’re following our lead and taking a tough stance on cracking down on unacceptable behaviour in the secondary ticket market.”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, also welcomed Ticketmaster’s decision to close down GetMeIn and Seatwave.“Ticketmaster’s move to close down their secondary platforms and concentrate resale efforts on their primary site is a welcome move,” he said.“By ensuring that real fans can legitimately and securely resell a ticket, they have put the interests of artists and fans above the touts. I hope that other primary ticket providers will follow suit and tell the touts that their time is up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d34e8db54166b17cf567f5bd774d16311ced25d/0_103_2442_1464/master/2442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1fde420cd25b7f38274be54bde23e4","title":"nicki minaj queen album review","story":"Not everything connects on the rapper’s regal fourth album, but when it does, she shows what a unique talent she isAs recently noted in these pages, the campaign for Nicki Minaj’s fourth album hasn’t been a charmed one: combative and snippy with fans on Twitter, she has not had a major hit with any of its singles. Her chart success has instead come from guesting on FeFe with 6ix9ine, the rapper who could be jailed and put on the sex offenders register for using a child in a sexual performance – perhaps not a great look for a woman trying to assert herself, from her album title downwards, as hip-hop’s head of state.And across 19 tracks, there are inevitably some that are not even fit for a lowly viscountess in a leaky manor house, particularly the R\u0026ampB numbers. Despite their heartfelt accounts of trust issues, Nip Tuck and Run \u0026amp Hide evaporate from your memory as soon as they end. Thought I Knew You is as disappointing as the romances that she and the Weeknd complain about. Her single with Ariana Grande, Bed, is melodically underpowered, even if Minaj vividly admires some oral lovemaking skills (indeed, the sex on the album is all about queenly cunnilingus, Minaj airily receiving rather than giving). But her singing voice – audibly influenced by Grande’s delivery – has strengthened, and, when given a robust song in Come See About Me, she creates an authentic lighters up moment.The reason why most people show up for Minaj though, is her rap flow: always on point, yet elastic and mutable. Perhaps her closest analogue is Eminem, someone else who plays with persona and sometimes lets their technical excellence do the heavy lifting rather than truly interesting lyrics. Amid “are they aren’t they” romance rumours, he turns up for a spectacular long-form verse on Majesty as he continues to rail against mumble rap with his fastest bars of all time. Minaj’s delivery is hefty too, but Labrinth’s catchy chorus is not finessed into her verses. Elsewhere she is slightly upstaged by a couple of other guests. Swae Lee makes Chun Swae perhaps the album’s best track, sweeping around his upper vocal register like a bird of prey catching thermals, while Foxy Brown’s percussive, rat-a-tat-tat patois on Coco Chanel is riveting.But when her own flow reaches equilibrium – vowels pitching and rolling in her Queens accent, but always kept in alignment – there are few who can match her. The verbal musicality to Chun-Li’s chorus is masterful, and while her manic, cartoonish-side might immediately distinguish her, as on her previous masterpieces such as Beez in the Trap, it’s her slower flows that are the most satisfying: there’s a certitude to her delivery on both Rich Sex and Miami which is truly befitting of a monarch. Her knowingly cutesy and babyish “Barbie” flow, meanwhile, is used immaculately on the Mike Will Made It-produced bounce track Good Form, with lines like “he tryna smash like when the whip flipsI hit licks just to floss with this wrist” hugely satisfying for their lip-smacking symmetry.Then there is the uproarious Barbie Dreams, a kind of celebrity roast that clowns some of the biggest names in rap for their physical and intellectual frailties as well as their sexual prowess. DJ Khaled’s unwillingness to give head to a woman is given particularly short shrift from the orally-fixated Minaj Drake seemingly does go down on her, “but I don’t know if the pussy wet or if he cryin’ and shit”. It is the perfect track for a gossipy, meme-obsessed age, and Minaj smartly puts herself at the front of the social media conversation.Perhaps as a result of having to be, per the cliche, twice as good as these men to be even half as successful, she is obsessed with status and domination. “New slaves, but I’m still the master … Miss Aretha, I think I just passed her” she states proudly, having broken Aretha Franklin’s record for the most US chart hits by a female solo artist earlier this year she clearly enjoys the sport of jostling for supremacy. But her zeal to cling to power means she makes a cheap shot at stripper-turned-chart-topper Cardi B – “I ain’t ever had to strip to get to pole position” – and throughout, the constant announcements of her own majesty muscle out other topics. There are some very strong tracks here and Minaj’s flow remains utterly unique, even if she only puts it to use disparaging her subjects. She still has a good case to be the queen, but uneasy lies the head that wears a crown, perhaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81856126594e91446ec6975b67d0b9127e45e10c/0_0_5178_3396/master/5178.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=53ad5212810a35e6a74902c38fd3d1e5","title":"can you solve it the mystery of cherrys lottery ball","story":"A logic puzzle about knowledgeOf the many types of puzzle I have posed over the years, the genre that readers seem to respond to best are “common knowledge” logic puzzles.

The other remaining half of this is money that is new to rough sleeping and homelessness, reflecting and recognising the priorities and importance of taxes.”Ministers will invite bids to build the homes outside London previously another £50m had been provided for a similar scheme in the capital. A further £17m will also be made available to fund about 15 pilot schemes aimed at trying to ensure rough sleepers do not spend a second night on the streets, as part of a scheme called Somewhere Safe to Stay.Homelessness charities welcomed the package of measures but said ministers had to go further. The Rough Sleeping Advisory Panel, a group of seven charities and umbrella groups, said “bold, cross-departmental plans” were needed to tackle the causes of homelessness.The panel said it was necessary “to build significantly more social housing, to foster greater security for renters, to ensure people have access to benefits and other support they need to help them keep their homes”. Healthcare, mental health and substance misuse services also needed to be easily accessible, it said.Brokenshire has promised to review the strategy annually and look at some of the wider issues raised by the charities in their statement. “It is simply unacceptable that people have to sleep on the streets and I am determined to make it a thing of the past.”The government also said it had stepped up housebuilding, with 217,000 homes constructed last year, although it said the market was “broken” because successive governments had not built enough.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We want to make sure we get to the root of the problem unique to every local authority and tackle these reasons. This strategy is the first step of a nine-year plan towards ending rough sleeping by 2027, but it is just the beginning.”Labour described the plan as “feeble” and lacking in urgency. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “The funding announced will barely register compared with the reckless Conservative cuts to affordable housing, social security benefits and homelessness services that have caused this crisis.”The opposition pledged to end rough sleeping in its first term in office by making 8,000 homes available.When introducing the strategy, Theresa May said nobody should have to sleep rough, but ministers recognised such situations were complex. “As well as ensuring people have somewhere to live, we have to deal with underlying problems and ultimately help people turn their lives around,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d8951839e0cacd90bb4109a0eff0b9f2662124/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4be9c79f80f9224d621cb6549e82e39","title":"more than munchies how eating pot went from crude to elevated dining","story":"Cannabis is becoming a cooking ingredient in its own right – like a grown-up pot brownie – and chefs are creating elaborate cannabis tasting menus at private dinners For most Americans, eating marijuana has long been about function over flavor. Think of the dish that inevitably comes to mind: pot brownies. Less a delicious dessert than a discreet delivery mechanism for THC (the drug’s primary psychoactive ingredient), brownies can be smuggled to places where cannabis isn’t welcome. Chocolate, meanwhile, does an adequate job of disguising the plant’s taste – which is reminiscent of dandelion leaves growing from cracks in the sidewalk.But with legalization and the attendant push to gentrify the drug, a small but vocal contingent have become champions of cannabis as a cooking ingredient in its own right. In cities where it’s legal, cannabis catering services now offer “elevated” dining experiences. On the new Netflix show Cooking on High, teams compete to make the most tempting ganja-infused dishes.Manny Mendoza, a young chef who has worked at some of Chicago’s best restaurants, said he learned at culinary school that he and his friends weren’t the only ones who liked to cook food and smoke weed. All over the world, “This is a part of us as cooks, as chefs”, he said.Mendoza began to think of cannabis as an “experiential seasoning” after being inspired by a music theory class. He compared the desired effect to synesthesia “a disorder, kind of” where people “start to taste colors or see sounds … A melding of the senses.”Even in legal states, restaurants can’t incorporate cannabis into their dishes since they’re not eligible for licenses. But the rules for private dinners are more open to interpretation. So Mendoza puts together elaborate cannabis tasting menus through his Herbal Notes project, based in Chicago and San Diego, California. The group throws dinners where cannabis, curated music and striking locations augment the food.Cannabis, like many other plants, gets its distinct aroma from chemicals known as terpenes, which can be flowery, spicy, earthy and a host of other flavors. To connoisseurs, the best weed is distinguished by the richness and complexity of its bouquet. And experienced cannabis chefs can often speak at great length about how they selected the cannabis sample for a particular dish.Easier access to weed is no doubt inspiring amateur chefs to whip up their own psychoactive specialties.Before getting started, it’s a good idea to do some research. Dosages can be hard to calculate, and eating too much pot can induce fear and paranoia which can last for hours.One place to begin is “The Cannabis Kitchen Cookbook” by Robyn Griggs Lawrence, the former editor of Natural Home magazine. Promising “Feel-good food for home cooks”, the book collects recipes for mains, sides, desserts, juices salads and alcoholic cocktails from several noted chefs, and some background on the plants history as a food.Cannabis is a good source of protein and “has been part of the human diet since eating began”, Lawrence writes. “Technically, it’s a vegetable.”Since THC is fat soluble, cannabis infused dishes typically begin by infusing the plant into fatty ingredients like butter, oil and honey, which can then be deployed in curries, pasta sauces, cookies and so on. The book’s more intriguing recipes include hemp seed-crusted Chinook salmon with cannabis cream and a side of cinnamon-cannabis roasted sweet potatoes.Lawrence is also a proponent of juicing raw cannabis, which minimizes its psychoactivity, and she says, maximizes its nutritional value.It’s too early to know whether high end cannabis cuisine will become more than a novelty. Elaborate dinners of cannabis-infused food don’t always compliment the the capricious moods the plant can induce. And in less formal settings, cannabis infused food isn’t necessarily more than the sum of its parts.It’s an indication of the drug’s growing acceptance, however, that Lawrence’s book updates yesteryear’s good enough ganja brownies as a dessert worthy of an upscale restaurant: “Cannabis, chia, almond and goji berry ‘pot brownie’ with cranberry, chocolate and red wine sauce,” anyone?A recipe for Cannabis, chia, almond and goji berry ‘Pot Brownies’ with cranberry, chocolate, and red wine sauce. By Andie Leon. Reprinted with permission from the Cannabis Kitchen CookbookTo make this recipe you’ll need to start with a cannabis agave.Andie Leon is a fan of agave because it has a low glycemic index and won’t spike blood sugar the way refined sugar does. The sweetener, made from the blue agave plant (the same plant that’s used to make tequila) is preferable for Andie’s vegan catering clients because it doesn’t come from bees, but it’s high in fructose and could be problematic for people with weight problems, diabetes, or heart disease. You can make this simple infusion with honey if you’re not an agave fan. To make her cold infusion, Andie simply pours a twelve-ounce bottle of raw blue agave over an eighth of an ounce of finely ground cured cannabis flowers wrapped in cheesecloth and lets it sit in a cool, dark place (in a labeled jar, of course) for at least five days (the longer it sits, the more potent it will be). After she’s squeezed every last drop of agave out of the cheesecloth, Andie pours another bottle of agave over the cannabis bundle to extract whatever THC remains. The second batch is generally less potent than the first, so note that when labeling it for storage. Cannabis agave will keep in a cool, dark place for up to a month.18 ounce (16g) cured and trimmed cannabis flowers1 12-ounce bottle raw blue agave or raw honeyCoffee grinder or mortar and pestleCheeseclothAirtight glass jarUsing a coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle, grind and crush cannabis to a fine powder. Wrap cannabis in a cheesecloth and tie ends together to make a bundle (or tie with string). Place in a labeled airtight glass container with a tightly fitting lid. Pour agave over cheesecloth. Seal with lid, label, and let sit in a dark place for at least 5 days. Remove cannabis bundle and squeeze out every last drop of agave. Compost cannabis solids or use to make another batch. Store in a cool, dark place for up to 1 month. Andie Leon transforms gluten-free brownies made with two-thirds of a cup of cannabis butter, mesquite flour, coconut sugar, cacao nibs, chia seeds, coconut, and goji berries into a full-on dessert when she smothers them in cranberry, chocolate, coconut, and red wine sauce made with a third of a cup of cannabis agave. Cacao nibs, “nature’s chocolate chips,” provide pure chocolate flavor from whole cacao beans as well as antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Andie makes the brownies with a combination of wheat flour and gluten-free mesquite flour, which is made from ground dried pods of the mesquite tree and is rich in soluble fiber, calcium, and magnesium. You could substitute mesquite flour for all the flour in this recipe to make it gluten-free, or you could substitute wheat flour for the mesquite flour if you prefer. The brownies are strong on their own, so start with 1” x 1” pieces (people who know they have tolerance can have more than one) and temper the dosage by drizzling on more or less sauce. The chocolate in this dessert overwhelms the taste of cannabis butter, so the taste of the cultivar you use isn’t all that important.1 13 cups flour, sifted23 cup mesquite powder (or flour)23 cup cocoa powder1 tsp baking powder2 eggs2 tbsp vodka¼ cup raw almonds (or almond flakes)½ cup cacao nibs1 tsp cannabis-infused agave or honey (recipe on page 118)23 cup cannabis-infused butter, softened (here’s a good basic pot butter recipe)23 cup coconut sugar¼ cup black chia seeds½ cup grated coconut½ cup goji berriesPreheat oven to 350°F.

The cheapest 1,000 sq ft apartment at the back is being marketed for sale at £2m. At the top of the nine-storey block, a double-height five bedroom penthouse is offered for £30m. The developer Fenton Whelan was initially going to contribute just £1.3m to Westminster council’s affordable housing fund in lieu of including any affordable units in the luxurious development, which will include a residents’ spa, swimming pool and private restaurant offering 24-hour room delivery. Architect renderings of the development show a brown nine-storey block on the junction of Bayswater Road and Queensway. The pictures were widely distributed to the media by the developer Fenton Whelan, as well as being included in the planning application document published on Westminster city council’s website. Computer generated images of the nine-storey building, which local residents have dubbed the “bulbous blockhouse”, loom over a row of mews houses dating back to the 1870s which featured in the 1977 movie Valentino starring Rudolf Nureyev. The images show the building standing considerably higher than other buildings neighbouring it on Bayswater. The architect-created images show almost every apartment will feature a balcony overlooking the park, including wrap-around balconies on the three multimillion pound penthouses. The plans show renderings of a three-level basement, featuring a “pool, gym and personal fitness, steam, sauna, jacuzzi and treatment room”.Nicky Hessenberg, a local resident, said it was outrageous that no space in the development was being made available for key workers who are struggling to find anywhere to live in the borough. “Our beloved Bayswater is being gentrified and for no good reason,” she said. “Less and less space is available to anyone without very much money as gentrification spreads through the boroughs of central and suburbs of London, so as a result it becomes less and less erse – what a depressing thought. Our beloved London becomes a collection of sterile and deserted boroughs where only the rich can afford to be.”Some 3,950 households are currently on Westminster council’s affordable housing waiting list. The developer will pay a further £7.3m for “public realm improvements”. Fenton Whelan said £2.6m of this will go towards the building of new “Royal Gates” entrance to Kensington Gardens. “The new Royal Gates will be cast iron gates of exceptional quality and British craftsmanship, with Royal regalia and crown detailing, finished with gold gilding,” the developer said in marketing this week.Members of the public were not allowed to speak at the planning meeting. This restriction is not connected to the developer – the council is one of three in the country that does not allow the public to address planning committees. Westminster council said its new leader, Nickie Aiken, had launched “a major overhaul of the planning process to ensure it is transparent and seen to be transparent”. “A review of planning is under way at Westminster at the moment and further changes, including allowing the public the direct right of address at meetings, are proposed,” a council spokesman said. The controversial plans were referred to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. He approved the scheme in July 2016 soon after he took office following a campaign centred on the urgent need to address London’s “housing crisis”. A spokesperson for the mayor said: “When Westminster council approved the scheme, the developer offered £8.5m towards affordable housing. It was referred to the mayor in July 2016, just weeks after Sadiq took office, at which point his new stronger policies on affordable housing had not yet been published.“Although the scheme had to be considered under the previous mayor’s London Plan policies, Sadiq’s team were able to negotiate with the developer and get their contribution increased to £11m.”Westminster councillor Paul Dimoldenberg, who speaks for Labour on business, said: “Sadly, as council we have a long history of taking the money rather than demanding that applicants follow the council’s own policies and provide affordable housing onsite. This happening all over the borough, from Soho to Bayswater. “Westminster is becoming a place that only the very rich can afford and that’s something that will undermine community life within the city. We fought a battle on this one, but we lost.”James Van Den Heule, who set up Fenton Whelan with fellow banker Sanjay Sharma, said he would have no hesitation in taking legal action against the  when a reporter asked him about the affordable housing provision in a prearranged interview. A spokesman for Van Den Heule said: “James does not want to co-operate or be quoted in any article … If you quote or misquote James in any manner in your article we will have no hesitation in considering taking legal action against both you personally and the .” He later added: “The Park Modern project will spearhead the regeneration of Queensway into Bayswater Village, a regeneration scheme which is championed by Westminster city council. The development will make a total public contribution of £18.3m which will be used to deliver £11m of affordable housing as well as a series of important public realm improvements.”The spokesman also pointed out: “Fenton Whelan has not made money on the project to date, the project will not realise profits until the private sale units are sold, so it would be a total misrepresentation to suggest to readers that the developer has already made vast sums of money on this project, whilst the local community has not. Again, the project will not make money for the developer until the sales campaign starts and units are actually sold. Without projects like this, and developers like Fenton Whelan, significant pieces of London would not benefit from regeneration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af356b8a5c0d789c2959d54bd8dad94b99b2d9a/251_317_3249_1949/master/3249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ecca6b79ba9a8dd3c79b259b7e508dd","title":"dina asher smith european championships","story":"Fourteen years ago, during the Athens Olympic Games, Dina Asher-Smith drew a picture of herself with six words scribbled underneath: “I want to win the Olympics.” After what we have seen in Berlin this past week, that increasingly looks like a precocious act of prophesy.It isn’t just that the 22-year-old’s stunning 100m gold on Tuesday was followed by an even more emphatic performance in the 200m on Saturday night. Or that her old British records were hung, drawn and quartered in the process. It is the fact that she has soared into a hyper-rarified atmosphere, running times – 10.85sec for the 100m and 21.89 for the 200m – that would have won gold medals at last year’s world championships in London.Have no doubt about it, Asher-Smith, who won a third gold in the sprint relay on Sunday night, is the real deal. Not only is she the fastest female sprinter in the world this year – but she is also the youngest ever member of the exclusive sub-10.9 seconds for 100m and sub 21.9 for 200m club. “I have obliterated my own expectations,” she admitted, beaming from ear to ear. The question for British athletics now is how many other members of their 102-strong team in Berlin will be able to take a similar leap from European to world level by the time of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics?Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who went toe-to-toe with the Olympic champion Nafi Thiam and scored a brilliant heptathlon personal best, is certainly one. Laura Muir, who has set multiple British records from 1,000m to 5,000m is another. In the men’s 100m Zharnel Hughes and Reece Prescod clearly have something about them. And I wouldn’t discount Lorraine Ugen, despite only finishing ninth in Berlin, given she has jumped a world leading 7.05m this year.Yet history offers a reminder that attempting the great leap forward from European success to world success can often lead to the track and field equivalent of falling flat on your face. After all, it was only four years ago that the British team left the European championships in Zurich with their best ever medal haul – 12 golds and 23 medals – after which UK Athletics’ performance director Neil Black began to dream of global glories at the 2015 and 2017 world championships and at the Rio Olympics.“We know there’s a hell of a lot of work to do,” he admitted. “But what this is telling us is that we’ve raised our game. I’m sure that the rest of the world are looking and going ‘bloody hell, perhaps these guys are going to give us a fright’. From here on, we go global.”At the time Black’s excitement was understandable. Victories for James Dasaolu and Adam Gemili meant Britain had won both European men’s 100m and 200m titles for the first time in 16 years, while Jodie Williams’s 200m silver was the fastest run by a Briton since 1984.It was also encouraging that a huge number of youngsters were blasting through together. Matthew Hudson-Smith, who won 400m silver, was 19, Gemili and Williams 20, Asher-Smith, who reached the 200m final only for her hamstring to rip like a zip, was just 18.The stage was set for more athletes to go global. Yet at the 2015 world championships in Beijing only the familiar names from London 2012 –Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford – along with long jumper Shara Proctor were able to win inidual medals.A year later, at the Rio Olympics, the pattern largely repeated itself with only the hammer thrower Sophie Hitchon – who claimed bronze – joining the Super Saturday trio when it came to success outside the relays. And in London 2017, with Ennis-Hill retired and Rutherford injured – it was only Farah, in his final year on the track, who won inidual medals.There is another statistic that is telling. In Zurich 16 British athletes won inidual medals – and all bar Mo Farah and Jo Pavey were in their 20s. You might have expected the majority to kick on and improve their personal bests in their best events. Yet only six of them – Gemili, Hudson-Smith, Andy Vernon, Chris O’Hare, Lynsey Sharp and Eilidh Child did so.That tells you two things. First, that because athletics is a truly global sport it is punishingly hard to be a world or Olympic champion. And second, that progress is not a smooth arc upwards. Some people hit their peak wildly early. Others experience false dawns and multiple failures or just get desperately unlucky injuries. That, unfortunately, is life as a track athlete.True, Britain have made an impressive habit of hoovering up relay medals including a gold and two silvers and a bronze at last year’s world championships in London. And you can’t blame British Athletics for targeting them given they are low-hanging fruit, allowing it to hit the medal target set by UK Sport.But these relay successes, as rewarding as they are for the athletes, realistically are not going to attract new people to watch track and field. They are the petit fours at the end of a major championships, not the hearty main course.That is why Asher-Smith’s stunning performance in Berlin has been so important. The sport in Britain desperately needs fresh heroes with eloquent stories to tell – especially as the 2012 Olympics and London 2017 fade to grey. Luckily the 22-year-old has the supreme talent to step up, break out, and go global."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56552dee9310430bcc7f5bde2e04ca7ac5d894c3/306_364_4070_2443/master/4070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef70a7df2bc916e949fdf542893b7677","title":"tiger woods us pga championship bellerive","story":"• 14-times major winner finishes behind Brooks Koepka• ‘I didn’t even know if I was going to play golf again’Tiger Woods reflected on “a hell of a process” to get to the position of being prominent in majors again, following a second-place finish at the US PGA Championship. This marked Woods’s highest major finish since being runner-up in the same tournament nine years ago.Brooks Koepka lifted the Wanamaker Trophy at Bellerive but attention was stolen by a resurgent Woods. Eleven months since the 14-times major champion admitted he “didn’t know what the future holds” amid troublesome recovery from a fourth back surgery, Woods has made meaningful challenges for the Open and US PGA.“I didn’t even know if I was going to play golf again,” Woods said. “I didn’t know what my schedule would be. I didn’t know how many tournaments I would play this year or if I would even play. So each tournament brought about its own challenges.“I didn’t know what the number was going to be this year. I didn’t know how I was going to play. And so at the beginning of the year, if you would say I would have a legit chance to win the last two major championships... with what swing? I didn’t have a swing at the time. I had no speed. I didn’t have a golf swing. My short game wasn’t quite there yet. My putting was OK. But God, I hadn’t played in two years. So it’s been a hell of a process for sure.”Woods is widely expected to be selected as a wildcard pick for this year’s US Ryder Cup team, marking a further nod towards the scale of his comeback. “I’m in uncharted territory because no one’s ever had a fused spine, hitting it like I’m hitting it,” he said. “So I had to kind of figure this out on my own and it’s been really hard. It’s a lot harder than people think. I’m just very pleased at what I’ve done so far and now to be part of the Ryder Cup conversation, going from where I’ve come from to now in the last year, it’s been pretty cool.”Woods broke with his own convention by waiting to congratulate Koepka warmly as the champion walked from the course. Woods had previously stated his desire to show his two children he was not solely a “YouTube golfer”. He added: “I don’t want to talk to them about it this week. They’re not really interested in it because they’re interested in starting school and they’re nervous about starting school. So that takes far more precedence than me playing a major.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1530ff3c67078b6c495bdf72b140baf850be3b57/0_92_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024eaa79085adcf042e51c85974b601d","title":"julie hesmondhalgh interview edinburgh fringe the greatest play in the history of the world","story":"Julie Hesmondhalgh, 48, was born in Accrington, Lancashire.

It’ll be romantic: in our 70s we can go and do it at festivals. So obediently, he kept disappearing over Christmas, and came back with this beautiful little gem of a play about love and loss and space and time.Reviewers have commented on what a lovely time you seem to have performing it. Are you?I’m terrified still! But you’ve got to fake it till you make it.Did you have any squabbles with your husband in the rehearsal room?No, he’s great. I did try my hand at rewriting swathes of it – and always ended up going back to what he’d written in the first place. I was just throwing my weight around really and, bless him, he let me.Is this your first time performing at the fringe?It is. I’ve seen 18 shows in the first week! I love it – it’s my happy place. You’ve got to make sure you don’t make yourself ill with running around, but it’s right up my street.Have you been given any advice for how to “survive” the month?It’s basically been just take your vitamins – which I have been doing, religiously – and have one day a week where you don’t see anything. I haven’t managed that yet…Do you have any tips for what to see?What Girls Are Made of, the Cora Bissett show. I found it one of the most incredibly moving and beautiful pieces that I’ve ever seen, let alone from this festival. It’s her story of losing her dad, and her brief flirtation with fame in the Britpop era.You’re a staunch Labour supporter. When did that start?Oh, always: I’m from a small northern industrial town and I lived through the Thatcher years. I’m a socialist, and it’s the engine that fires me, really – just hoping for a better, more equal society. These are such strange times we’re living in, you can see how quickly things can change for example, the #MeToo movement, which just shifted everything on its axis. Surely we’re at the tipping point now for austerity.Do you think people are reclaiming the term “socialist” after generations of it being a bit of a dirty word?Yeah, I do actually, in the same way that “feminist” has been reclaimed. I have teenage daughters and they give me such hope: their outlook on the world is so much more inclusive and accepting than even a generation ago. We’ve got a new generation who are proud to be socialist, and that’s really exciting.How do you feel Labour is performing?Everyone knows we’re in difficult times. But I’ve shared a platform with Jeremy Corbyn for many years and I know him to be a man of deeply held principles. The current problems in the party need to be sorted out, but if we carry on fighting within the left, the Tories are going to get in again. And it’s not just a matter of dinner party conversation – people are losing their lives. Disabled people are dying at an astonishing rate, the NHS is on its knees…Do you think it’s your duty as someone with a public profile to campaign politically?I think it’s my duty as a citizen it’s nothing to do with being a famous person. If you dare to go on a demonstration or raise your voice in solidarity with people that have less than you, people say: “Oh luvvies, what’s it got to do with you?” I’m not there as a luvvie – I’m there as a person who lives in this country, and wants to pay more tax! I’ve nothing to gain from it.You made history playing Hayley in Coronation Street at a time when trans narratives were very rare. Do you feel proud of it?I’m amazingly proud of it. It started a conversation, because soaps often do. Corrie put a love story at the heart of it – and that’s how you change the world. You’re hosting a charity sing-a-long screening of Mamma Mia in September. What’s your favourite Abba tune?Dancing Queen – obviously!

In the case of Lost Boys? What’s Going Wrong For Asian Men, the undermining effect is heightened by a question mark that seems to be in the wrong place – Lost Boys: What’s Going Wrong For Asian Men? would surely have been better.Baig provided an object lesson in how to tackle an immensely sensitive subject head on. First, know what you are talking about. A British-Pakistani herself, Baig is a former state-school teacher with considerable experience of the problems facing young Asian boys. Second, speak directly to the community concerned, for it also knows what it is talking about.In Bradford, where a fifth of the population is Asian, British-Pakistani boys suffer by reputation – they are thought of as “groomers, terrorists and drug dealers”. They also face grinding deprivation. In the 1950s, when a new dam flooded the farms of Mirpur, thousands of displaced young men came to the north of England to work in the mills. But the mills are now gone. Of Pakistani men now employed in Bradford, one in four is a taxi driver. Seventeen-year-old Luqman has been working since he was 13 – sometimes juggling three jobs at once – to help his mother make ends meet. The temptation to deal drugs is ever present, but he resists it. “At the end of the day, we have to remember that we’re Muslims,” he said.The boys also tend to suffer from a certain isolation, living at home for longer and attending segregated schools. Nav, 27, found university a huge cultural shock. “I had to talk, and meet people called David and John,” he said. Unable to cope, he left after his first term.Baig did not shy away from the opinion – held by her father and other, older immigrants she met – that many of these boys are simply spoiled. Treated like princelings at home, they are reluctant to fly the nest even when they are in full-time work (to be fair, the young men she interviewed did not disagree with this characterisation).The most intriguing aspect of Baig’s investigation was the extent to which these hardships do not affect Asian men outside the British Mirpuri community. The Gujaratis who fled Uganda with nothing in the 1970s prospered quickly, and assimilated more readily. Their young male descendants have inherited a legacy of entrepreneurial flair, not to mention money.There was a lot to absorb here. But that question mark in the title was certainly undeserved: informed, thorough and provocative, Baig’s report was full of hard answers.Also part of the Big British Asian Summer, The Stolen Maharaja (BBC Four) traced the story of Duleep Singh, the last Maharaja of the Punjab. In 1848, the 10-year-old Singh was already on the throne, but he was soon deposed by the British, separated from his mother and removed to a remote outpost under ship of an army surgeon. He made the long journey from imprisoned child to English aristocrat, all while barely having a say in the matter. It is a fascinating tale if you don’t already know it. I didn’t.Recently unearthed archives contain his adolescent letters, and show him to be ever the devoted ward (“I hope that you will not look at my mistakes in writing and spelling”). At 16, he was taken to Britain, where he met Queen Victoria, who proclaimed him “extremely handsome”. The 1857 Indian Rebellion prevented his return home. He built the sprawling Elveden Hall in Suffolk with cash from the India Office, and joined the Prince of Wales’s hunting set. Then the money ran out. Refused permission to return to his ancestral lands, he ended his days in Paris, plotting an Indian invasion with a soldier of fortune who was actually a spy. For much of his life, he lived like a king, but he was always a pawn, cruelly used and readily sacrificed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fcee0336cb059807383413ba6991d358a19fa43/0_30_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0afbafada2307011b1c934b0bd12e409","title":"united nations human rights nearly impossible to defend zeid raad al hussein","story":"Exclusive: Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, who steps down this month, says US president’s rhetoric echoes that of the worst eras of the 20th centuryDonald Trump’s anti-press rhetoric is “very close to incitement to violence” that would lead to journalists censoring themselves or being attacked, the outgoing UN human rights commissioner has said.Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and diplomat, is stepping down this month as UN high commissioner for human rights after deciding not to stand for a second four-year term, in the face of a waning commitment among world powers to fighting abuses.Zeid said the Trump administration’s lack of concern about human rights marked a distinct break with previous administrations, and that Trump’s own rhetoric aimed at minorities and at the press was redolent of two of the worst eras of the 20th century, the run-up to the two world wars.In an interview with the , he singled out the US president’s repeated designation of the press as “the enemy of the people”.“We began to see a campaign against the media … that could have potentially, and still can, set in motion a chain of events which could quite easily lead to harm being inflicted on journalists just going about their work and potentially some self-censorship,” Zeid said. “And in that context, it’s getting very close to incitement to violence.”He said it would be up to a court but determine whether Trump was actually guilty of incitement depending on the circumstances, if say, a journalist was stabbed while covering a rally. He said Trump’s example was already being followed elsewhere, giving license to authoritarian leaders to crack down on the media in ways they had not previously dared to. Zeid pointed to the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, who he said had used similar language when he closed down independent media organisations.Zeid has also taken on the Trump administration over its policy of separating children from their parents in migrant families arrested at the border, and Trump’s own long history of rhetoric aimed at minorities.“When language is used in a way that focuses on groups of people who have traditionally suffered a great deal from bigotry and prejudice and chauvinism, it harked back to a period not too long ago in the 20th century when feelings were stoked, directed at a vulnerable group for the sake of political gain,” he said, adding that he was referring in particular to the 1930s and the period before the first world war.Zeid began his tenure as UN human rights commissioner in 2014 during the Obama administration and said his contacts with the state department dropped off significantly after Trump took office in January 2017.“The Trump administration seems to have separated itself from previous administrations in its upholding of human rights globally,” Zeid said. The administration’s failure to appoint an ambassador to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, before withdrawing from the council altogether, he added, was “illustrative of the lack of any deep commitment to the human rights”.Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family.

Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory.Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides.

In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.A pivotal moment came in March when Zeid was blocked from even addressing the Security Council on human rights in Syria, where more than half a million people have been killed in seven years of violence.Russia and China were adamantly opposed but the French delegation was confident it had the nine votes necessary for the session to go ahead.However, with less than a minute to go and Zeid primed to speak, the ambassador from the Ivory Coast informed his French counterpart he had changed his mind and would abstain. The session was called off. The Ivorean government insisted that its diplomat, Bernard Tanoh-Boutchoue, had acted without its permission. Western diplomats became convinced that Tanoh-Boutchoue, who had previously served as ambassador to Moscow, had come under pressure from Russia to switch his vote, but the mystery was never resolved. The 67-year-old diplomat died in New York of a sudden illness, said to be a heart attack, a month after his controversial abstention.Zeid said he never understood the machinations behind the vote, but said it reflected a broader trend.“It tells me more about the weakening influence of the western powers that they could not secure nine votes for a briefing on human rights in Syria,” he said. “If you are discussing Syria in the security council and you are not discussing gross human rights violations, what are you discussing? The latest arts and crafts fair in Damascus? It’s ridiculous.”Zeid’s has often been a lonely voice. Hopes that the current secretary general, Antonio Guterres, would be more outspoken on human rights than his predecessor, have been dashed, a western diplomat at the UN said.“There is a complete separation of what Zeid said and what the secretary general says, and his impact has been reduced because of that,” the diplomat said. “And there a broader problem of the ability of human rights abuses to shock and lead to a change of policy. That link has been broken. Actors who should have listened to Zeid, have not.”Zeid said he came to the decision early on in his tenure to speak out on human rights abuses irrespective of the political circumstances. He attributed his approach in part to his first major foreign mission as a UN official in his early 30s, when he witnessed first hand UN dithering and timidity during the fall of the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, and the subsequent slaughter of some 8,000 men and boys by Bosnian Serb troops.“We felt that there were periods of silence and that was painful for the UN and the UN was not respected ultimately by the parties to the conflict and therefore we saw the disasters that came from it,” Zeid said. “And … if the UN is not respected, the UN is rolled over to my mind. You don’t earn anyone’s respect by being silent.”Zeid’s advice to his successor, Michele Bachelet, who has been both a political prisoner and president in her native Chile, is to stay courageous and not to run for a second term.“I would be very suspicious of any commissioner seeking a second term because I’d wonder what deals are being struck and if they’d been struck they’ve been struck on the back of victims,” he said.The job of bearing witness to crimes against humanity also takes an emotional toll. Zeid recalled a trip to Mexico to speak to the families of 43 students who were abducted and presumed murdered by a criminal gang in 2014.“I was listening to mothers and fathers, siblings, speak of those who were disappeared and presumably killed. After that, I had a series of interviews and I wasn’t in the right emotional state to actually give the interview because there was something deep within me where I felt I was a fraud,” Zeid said. “That given the enormity, the colossal nature of their suffering … with us they wanted salvation … they want an end to suffering. They want us to do something that is many respects almost impossible to do. That is where most of the pressure comes from in this job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6a4b06b6bb4e6952e8d7f09b1cd8dbed1489570/0_88_2910_1746/master/2910.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa5e116d867d63aafa2b6c79f6e58750","title":"vermont primary christine hallquist candidate governor","story":"Christine Hallquist tells the  about running for governor: ‘I tell people this isn’t the hardest thing I ever did. I think after transitioning everything else looks pretty easy’If Christine Hallquist can win Tuesday’s Democratic primary, and go on to run for Vermont governor, it will be the first time in history that Americans will be able to vote for a transgender woman for such a senior political role.For Hallquist, it will cap a remarkable journey which has included decades of internal strife over how her family would accept her as Christine, the five-year transition process before she felt ready to present herself as a woman in her job as a high-powered CEO, and even dodging an exorcism attempt as a child. met Hallquist five days before the primary election. That evening, Hallquist would debate her three rivals for the Democratic nomination – the 20th such debate over the past few months. It was her last chance to pitch herself to voters statewide before Tuesday’s vote, but Hallquist was relaxed.“I tell people this isn’t the hardest thing I ever did. In fact, I think after transitioning everything else looks pretty easy,” Hallquist said.Including Hallquist, there are four candidates running for the Democratic nomination. The winner will face the incumbent Republican governor Phil Scott, whose popularity in the state has tanked since the turn of the year.Sitting in her Burlington campaign headquarters, a stone’s throw from the picturesque Church Street with its bars, restaurants and shops – Hallquist is a jovial, disarming presence. She has not yet acquired the guarded demeanor of a career politician, and a number of times during our conversation she starts an answer by saying: “I shouldn’t say this”, then laughs and says it anyway.Hallquist, 62, is keen to talk about her vision for Vermont – she wants to provide broadband access across the state, which she believes would aid rural economies, and she is a longtime advocate for environmental energy policies – but has dealt with enough interest at this point to know there will inevitably be questions about being transgender. She said that from a young age she felt she was a girl trapped in a boy’s body.“When I was 11-years-old – I’ll remember this day forever, it’s like a snapshot – the day my mom dressed me as Little Red Riding Hood for Halloween. “And it was beautiful. I loved it. And I said: ‘Mom, I want to be a girl.’ And she said: ‘Well never tell anybody that.’ “That’s really all she said, but the way she said it I thought: ‘I’m never going to tell anybody that’.” At that time it was still possible for people identifying as transgender to be placed in a mental institution, Hallquist said, and she understands her mother’s attempts to protect her. But though she hid her gender identification, Hallquist was an effeminate child, which didn’t go down well in the Catholic school where she was taught – and says she was regularly beaten – by nuns. Neither did the fact that she had been identified as “gifted” intellectually, Hallquist said, and prone to question certain aspects of the Catholic faith.Her parents refused the monsignor’s suggestion and pulled Hallquist, along with her siblings, out of the school. She went to a public school, later gaining a two-year associate degree, before rising through the business world to eventually become CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative, an electricity company that serves about 34,000 people, mostly in northern Vermont.Hallquist said she would have been happy to carry on at the company, eventually easing into retirement, but she was inspired to run for governor by the election of Donald Trump.“November 8 2016, I realized the world changed,” she said. “I went to bed, and of course like any other trauma I was in political depression and I just didn’t know what to do. I mean, many of us in this country shed a lot of tears for what happened on November 8.”On 20 January 2017 Hallquist was among the hundreds of thousands of people who travelled to Washington DC for the Women’s March. Three months later she went back to DC, for the People’s Climate March, and from there began to investigate running for office.Hallquist is among a small number of transgender people running for office this year. On Saturday, Kim Coco Iwamoto lost her bid to become Hawaii’s next lieutenant governor. Alexandra Chandler is running in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts third congressional district, while former journalist Danica Roem was elected to the Virginia state legislature in November 2017.Hallquist has been in contact with Roem, receiving guidance and support, while she is also in good company in her choice of campaign headquarters: Bernie Sanders, running for election to the US Senate, has based his own campaign upstairs. The two know each other through Hallquist’s time in the private sector, but she has not had any formal contact with him during her campaign. Unlike Sanders, she is unwilling to class herself as a democratic-socialist, or even as a progressive, despite running on a left-leaning platform which includes a better living wage and Medicare for all. “I would never class myself as anything,” she said. “Living wage, medicare for all, why are these progressive policies?”One of the things Hallquist had braced herself for when she announced her campaign was the level of attention her run would attract. She has had interview requests from numerous international media outlets and believes it has helped with her name recognition back home.She’s also received a personal boost as supportive messages have flooded in “from around the world”, Hallquist said, some of them from people in a similar situation to hers.“There have been older people I’ve met, in their 60s or 70s, who have never been able to cross that threshold, who have said they admire my courage,” Hallquist said. “They’re people who have lived their whole lives with this secret.”But, predictably, some of the attention has been negative. Some of the worst came after she was interviewed by the UK’s Channel 4 News. More than 200,000 people watched the video on Facebook, and it attracted a slew of “awful” comments, Hallquist said, most of them from men. It’s something her family had been fearful of. As Hallquist prepared to tell them about her political ambitions she said there were echoes of when she first told her children that she would be becoming Christine – something she had wrestled with for a long time.“My spouse and I were going to go to the grave with this,” Hallquist said of her being transgender.“The only reason I did this, really, was because my children didn’t know the truth about me. And of course I started to feel so guilty that I wasn’t going to leave the planet without them knowing the truth.”With her family now fully supportive, Hallquist is eager for Tuesday’s vote, and has a sense that Vermont, with its democratic socialist senator and progressive history, is the place where a transgender candidate could become governor.“I gotta believe it’s easier in Vermont,” Hallquist said as we ate dinner on Burlington’s Church Street. “Could we do this in Alabama? Probably not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d239d7f2a7e4b409e69ef32e68be210df6371acb/5_151_2024_1214/master/2024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da2cef2a774e0d0ebc5324f2db926e5","title":"smitten with kittens advert for cat caring job on greek isle brings deluge of candidates","story":"Sanctuary has to curtail number of applicants eager to take job looking after 55 rescue cats ‘in Cyclades paradise’As job offers go it’s hard to beat.

However, anti-smoking campaigners said this argument “no longer has any credibility”.Government guidelines say trustees can take ethical, social or environmental concerns into account, as long as the fund’s finances do not suffer. And several investment professionals contested the idea that selling tobacco stocks would crimp returns, pointing to the long-term risks threatening the industry.The schemes, which manage £211bn between them, have £1.7bn of direct tobacco investments, as well as a further £1.1bn via pooled investments, where money is grouped with other clients’ cash as part of larger funds managed.The council pension funds received idend income of around £63m, according to FOI requests, although in practice the figure is likely to be higher because some councils provided incomplete information.West Yorkshire Pension Fund is the largest direct investor in tobacco, with £284m held in major purveyors of cigarettes, including £180m in British American Tobacco. It did not disclose its passive investments in the industry.Public Health England’s figures showed that the region’s biggest cities, Bradford and Leeds, have above-average levels of smoking-related mortality, estimated respectively at 350 and 332 deaths per 100,000 of the population over 35 in 2014-16. The average rate for England is 272.West Yorkshire Pension Fund manages the retirement money of staff working for dozens of schools, the West Yorkshire fire authority and local leisure organisations.Lothian Pension Fund is the second biggest tobacco investor with £110m of holdings. Its rate of smoking-related deaths is even higher, at 392 per 100,000 of the population.Liverpool has one of the highest levels of smoking-attributable deaths, with 442 per 100,000 population. But the Merseyside Pension Fund remains an avid tobacco investor, with £64m of holdings in the industry, the eighth most out of more than 100 pension funds surveyed.Employers in its scheme – and that of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which has £69m in tobacco securities – include City Healthcare Partnership. The organisation provides cancer screening, end-of-life care for cancer sufferers and stopping smoking services. A spokesperson explained that only a few of its staff are in these schemes because they were recruited from the council and kept their council-administered pensions.Nottinghamshire pension fund has £95m of direct investments in tobacco and its scheme members include Nottinghamshire Fire Safety, which is owned by the local fire authority.Smoking was the cause of more than a third of house fire fatalities in 201617, according to figures from the Home Office.Hampshire, which has £77m of direct holdings, said it was legally bound “to invest fund monies to achieve the best possible financial return, and does not restrict investment managers from choosing certain stocks”.Nottinghamshire council said it preferred a “strategy of engagement” with companies on matters of environmental, social and governance issues.But experts questioned whether it was even possible to engage with tobacco companies on smoking-related harm, while analysis suggested funds can still perform well without tobacco investments.The MSCI World Tobacco Index, which tracks the industry’s investment returns compared with other industries, showed that global stocks have matched or outperformed tobacco in four of the past six years.A separate study by financial data analysis firm FTSE Russell showed that over the past 10 years returns from a portfolio tracking the FTSE Developed Index would have been very little different if it had excluded tobacco stocks.Several local authority funds, including the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, the UK’s largest local authority scheme, which manages more than £20bn of assets, have already taken the decision to exit tobacco for ethical and social reasons, as have some of the world’s largest fund managers.Helena Viñes Fiestas, the head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, which has moved to disinvest in tobacco investment, said there was no conflict between ethics and financial returns given a recent downturn in tobacco firms’ fortunes.Tobacco firms count on emerging economies for much of their growth as smoking rates decline in wealthier economies. Viñes Fiestas said tobacco’s prospects were limited by tightening regulation in the developing world, partly due to the World Health Organization’s framework convention on tobacco control.Viñes Fiestas added that there was no point in councils promising to engage with tobacco companies on ethical issues. “The problem is the product itself and there’s no responsible way of using it.”Fund managers holding $3.8tn of assets last year called for an end to tobacco investment and sold their own holdings.Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of health charity Action on Smoking and Health, said: “Local authority pension funds usually argue they invest in tobacco because they have a legal duty to get the best deal for their pensioners.“But this argument, which was always dubious, no longer has any credibility at all, as tobacco stocks are turning into a bad investment financially as well as morally. Local authority pension funds need to follow the lead taken by Greater Manchester, do their sums and get out of tobacco.”The combined annual cost of smoking-related illness to the NHS is estimated at more than £3bn, while the overall societal cost could be as high as £12.9bn, according to anti-smoking health group ASH.The Tobacco Manufacturers’ Association said its members paid £9.5bn of excise duty in 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bcd22b7a197d8c4227c375b3cb2ca6a21e324fb/0_158_2781_1668/master/2781.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=201f1a04b58fce1a285a58175ce98738","title":"fukushima residents complain over statue of boy in radiation suit","story":"Critics say artwork outside train station gives impression area is unfit for habitationResidents of Fukushima have demanded the removal of a statue of a child in a protective suit from outside the city’s railway station, saying it gives the impression that the area is unfit for human habitation as a result of the 2011 nuclear disaster.The statue, by Kenji Yanobe, depicts a child dressed in a yellow Hazmat-style suit, with a helmet in one hand and an artistic representation of the sun in the other.Yanobe said his Sun Child, which was installed by the municipal government after appearing at art exhibitions in Japan and overseas, was intended to express his desire for a nuclear-free world.The artist said he did not mean to give the impression that local children needed to protect themselves from radiation more than seven years after the Fukushima Daiichi plant became the scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.He pointed out that the child was not wearing the helmet and that a monitor on its chest showed radiation levels at “000”.But he added: “I should have paid more attention to the fact that accurate knowledge about radiation is needed much more now than before the disaster.”His statue drew criticism on social media and in messages to the city government after it went on display this month. “It will cause damage to Fukushima’s reputation because it gives the impression that people cannot live there without protective gear,” one poster said, according to Kyodo.Others pointed out that the monitor reading of zero was misleading, since areas that have not been affected by nuclear leaks have varying levels of background radiation.The mayor of Fukushima, Hiroshi Kohata, defended the decision to install the statue, saying he believed the child looked hopeful about the city’s future, and the sun symbol was a reference to the need to develop clean energy sources.However, he acknowledged public criticism of the statue and said he would take into account the opinions of residents before making a decision on its future.Japan’s government hopes the 2020 Tokyo Olympics will help highlight Fukushima’s recovery from the disaster, despite the slow pace of the costly and complicated task of decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi, and concerns about radiation levels in nearby communities.The city will host Olympic baseball and softball games and was recently chosen as the starting point for the Olympic torch relay.The row over the statue comes as local authorities are trying to persuade families to return to evacuated neighbourhoods. Few residents have returned to cities, towns and villages where evacuation orders have been lifted, with families with young children most concerned about moving back.In Naraha, about 12 miles south of the plant, only several hundred people among the pre-disaster population of 7,400 have returned since the town was declared safe in September 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e068ca24ba1000e5571f164ced3064719b94644/0_92_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f8dfb317b1bdd48e7cd197c5266495e","title":"taliban hails helpful us talks as boost to afghan peace process","story":"White House diplomacy efforts are proving successful, says member of militant groupFresh hope has been injected into the Afghan peace process after Taliban officials said groundbreaking preliminary talks with the US last month were “very helpful” and that another round will take place in Doha in September.Four Taliban members met Alice Wells, a senior US state department official, at a hotel in the Qatari capital on 23 July for the first face-to-face talks in seven years. The diplomacy follows the White House’s decision to drop its opposition to bilateral talks with the Islamist insurgency it has failed to uproot in 17 years of war. On Sunday fighting continued for the third consecutive day between the Taliban and Afghan security forces in the eastern city of Ghazni. The US previously said it would sit on the sidelines of an “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned” peace process. The Trump administration changed tack, however, in recognition of the Taliban’s refusal to enter negotiations with the Afghan government without first discussing the removal of foreign troops in the US.The first round of basic contacts “were very helpful”, a senior member of the Taliban’s Quetta Shura told the . They requested anonymity as only the movement’s spokesperson is authorised to speak in public. “The next round will be more specific and focused on key issues,” the Quetta Shura member said. They added that after the agenda-setting talks, the insurgency will eventually sit down with Afghan leaders. In February, President Ashraf Ghani offered the Taliban wide-ranging incentives for a peace deal, including political recognition and a constitutional review.“Once the breakthrough is started it will be stunning for all,” said the Quetta Shura member. A sense of cautious optimism has spread through Washington after the unprecedented ceasefire during the Eid holiday in June, during which 20,000 unarmed Taliban fighters flooded city centres, posting selfies and dancing with soldiers and civilians.According to US website the Daily Beast, the Taliban negotiators have shown willingness to compromise on the longstanding demand to evict all foreign troops before any negotiations with the Afghan government. The report claimed that the Taliban could even countenance a remaining US force in the country so long as it was involved in the political process that reached such an agreement. Christopher Kolenda, an Afghanistan veteran who was present for the talks, told the Daily Beast: “I was struck by what I detected was a much higher level of seriousness about bringing the conflict to a close than I saw in 2011.”US officials have also been boosted by the negotiators’ commitment to ridding Afghanistan of foreign terrorist groups, a key objective upon which the war was launched in 2001. This month a Taliban assault forced 250 Isis fighters to surrender in their northern base of Jowzjan. Fighters are moving in on the Isis’ stronghold in the eastern province of Nangarhar for what may be a climactic battle.Ghani’s administration has not objected to the preliminary US talks. This represents a positive development as similar efforts were scuppered in 2011 by then president, Hamid Karzai, who felt they undermined his government’s authority. Reservations about the Taliban leadership’s desire for peace still run deep, however.Before the recent talks, the Taliban’s leadership took steps to bring the group’s informal office in Doha more in line with fighters in the field, according to an official. This included setting up a communication channel for quickfire responses from inside Afghanistan. The Taliban’s leader, Haibatullah Akhunzada, had previously barely spoken to representatives in Doha, who are often viewed suspiciously within the group and perceived to represent a fringe of the insurgency more open to peace than its military core. Several Taliban members said that before the next round of talks Haibatullah was considering placing military representatives in the Doha team. One potential split concerns a second ceasefire. In contrast to the Doha office, the military commanders are not in favour of another pause in hostilities during the Eid holiday at the end of the month, said a Taliban member in Helmand province, where the military leadership is based.Military leaders may be tempted to continue the war as, despite Donald Trump’s troop surge in 2017, the latest report from the US government watchdog shows that no territory has been won back from the Taliban. A Taliban leader said Russian diplomats had shared with him intelligence that the US will withdraw from Afghanistan in 2020, which could bolster heel-dragging and obstructionism in the talks. Michael Semple, an expert on the region and former deputy to the EU special representative in Afghanistan, said that those predicting an imminent breakthrough in peace negotiations were engaged in “Pollyanna thinking”. “I see a sustained military campaign, still taking advantage of safe havens in Pakistan, which is wearing down the Afghan security forces, exploiting the isions inside the Afghan government, building up frustration within the US government and drawing us nearer the point Donald Trump pulls the plug,” he said.

The company said it was closing its secondary ticketing sites Seatwave and GET ME IN! across Europe and will instead roll out a new “fan-to-fan ticket exchange” in Ireland and the UK in October with a similar service due across Europe in early 2019.The new ticket exchange will allow fans to buy and sell tickets at the original price or less, the company said. “Closing Seatwave and creating a new ticket exchange has always been part of Ticketmaster’s long-term plan. It’s not just in Ireland, it is happening across Europe, “ said Keith English, Managing Director of Ticketmaster Ireland.“Our number one priority is to get tickets into the hands of fans so that they can go to the events they love. We are aware that fans are tired of seeing others snap up tickets just to resell for a profit on secondary websites, so we have decided to take action.”He said the new Ticketmaster ticket exchange would let fans “sell tickets they can’t use directly through their Ticketmaster account, for the price originally paid or less.” Seatwave has come in for fierce criticism from music fans, politicians and consumer watchdogs in Ireland for years over concerns that it was facilitating ticket touting.There have been frequent reports of tickets for popular events selling out in minutes with many reappearing on Seatwave and the other main ticket resale website Viagogo at a multiple of their original value.Last year the State’s consumer watchdog, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, launched a wide-ranging investigation into ticket-touting in the Republic.It began the inquiry into “suspected breaches of competition law in relation to the provision of tickets and the operation of ticketing services for live events” last year.The move was prompted by concerns over the speed at which tickets for high-profile events were selling out and how such tickets were subsequently reappearing for resale at vastly inflated prices on secondary sites such as the Ticketmaster-owned Seatwave, Viagogo, and other online platforms.The focus of the investigation was on potentially anti-competitive conduct by operators in the sector.

The target industrial lands are all beside established residential areas, with some already served by Luas and rail lines.The rezoning of the hundreds of acres could result in a windfall for land owners whose sites are no longer commercially viable, but who have been unwilling to sell up because of the lower property values attached to industrially zoned lands.Previously, old industrial or “brownfield” sites have been zoned on a case-by-case basis, but city councillors will, in the coming months, be asked to consider mass rezoning of large portions of – or sometimes entire – industrial estates.“A lot of this land is totally underutilised,” Mr Kenny said. “In some places, for a large number of years there has been little or no activity on them.”The council will initially focus on the city’s older industrial estates which were once at the city’s outer reaches and have over the years become “sandwiched” between residential areas, such as the Dublin Industrial Estate in Glasnevin, the Kylemore Industrial Estate, west of Inchicore, and industrial lands around Coolock to the northeast of the city.While these lands are in private ownership, the council hopes the change in zoning would “encourage” owners to either sell, or form development partnerships for the land.“These industrial estates are ripe for development, but are owned by many people. We would like to see landowners coming together with masterplans on how their sites might be redeveloped.”Even if land was rezoned, existing business could choose to continue operating, he said.“It’s private property, we can’t take their premises off them, but we would like to give encouragement. We’re talking about big tracts of land, there is a lot of potential out there.”Plans were already in place for all the council-owned land banks in the city, Mr Kenny said, and with Dublin facing ongoing housing shortages, in both the public and the private sector, now was the time to rezone older industrial lands. “We are running out of land. In four years’ time we won’t have any land left in the city for housing development.”The council is particularly interested in the potential of the Dublin Industrial Estate, which has an entrance opposite Glasnevin cemetery but largely sits between Cabra and Finglas south.The Government’s new Urban Development and Building Heights guidelines, which are available for public consultation for the next six weeks, stop local authorities setting “generic maximum height limits” on buildings. Increased height was “not only desirable but a fundamental policy requirement” in areas with the potential for comprehensive development such as “brownfield former industrial districts” the guidelines state.“It is Government policy that building heights must be generally increased in appropriate urban locations. There is, therefore, a presumption in favour of buildings of increased height in our towncity cores and in other urban locations with good public transport accessibility.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoNeuromorphic\u0026rsquo computers will be able to carry out tasks natural to the human brainCompany announces new \u0026lsquofan-to-fan\u0026rsquo ticket exchange in place of resale operationsInjured man in his 30s hospitalised as garda\u0026iacute investigate morning incident at Beresford PlaceEmergency services were called to the home in Knocktopher on Sunday eveningHomeless crisis having \u0026lsquodisproportionate\u0026rsquo impact on Travelling communityCorrespondence shows frustration at lack of cycle paths and of cyclist behaviour in DublinGroup opposed to masterplan says a bridge across lake will demean heritageRefugee Muhanad Jazmati wants to bring his wife, twin sons and stepson to IrelandDiarmuid Martin: \u0026lsquoNot informed of any such interventions at that time by either side\u0026rsquoFunds have been drawn from a \u0026euro12m idend from the Irish Aviation AuthorityINTO says schools have to call on retired staff to shore up short-term needsCity councillors will be asked to consider mass rezoning of lands, says housing chiefAcademics criticise emphasis on rote learning and say those with access to grinds have advantageIrish Prison Service says one of 47 \u0026lsquoCategory A\u0026rsquo allegations made this year upheld so farIrish-American businessman became a crucial player in peace process, says Gerry AdamsCity council\u0026rsquos concerns over Military Road transport plans discountedFresh attempt to broker resolution in dispute between airline and pilots to get underwayMost common forms of litter were plastic bottles, cans, cigarette butts and sweet wrappers"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3593602.1534018029!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit france to veto re routed trade plan between ireland and europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench concern at rerouting: At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.France will not accept a European Commission proposal to exclude French ports from a re-routed trade corridor between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit, the government has said.At the moment much of Ireland’s trade with the continent goes via Britain in trucks.

French ports such as Calais and Dunkirk would be bypassed.“France and Ireland maintain important trade channels, both overland via Britain and via direct maritime routes. The geographical proximity between Ireland and France creates an obvious connection to the single market,” wrote French minister for transport Elisabeth Borne to the EU’s transport commissioner on August 10th.“Surprisingly, the Commission proposal in no way takes this into account. This proposal therefore is not acceptable to France,” noted Ms Borne.At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.Ms Borne said that French ports had the necessary resources to ensure they could handle the likely increase in trade flows, hinting at concerns of congestion in ports such as Calais, France’s busiest passenger port. – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

At the end of the day it is a public amenity … it shouldn’t be exclusive for anybody.”In a recent letter to the Dalkey Newsletter, local resident Lorraine Montgomery said the bathing area was a public amenity and “shouldn’t be hijacked by a few”.Local Independent councillor Michael Merrigan said the issue of the bathing area was a “storm in a teacup”.Since the nudist bathing spot gained publicity in recent weeks, some residents had been raising opposition to the proposed signage, which some fear may “attract unwanted questionable activity” , he said.However, the local authority had a “responsibility to warn people” that the small bathing area was nudist-friendly, Mr Merrigan said. If there were any issues with antisocial behaviour at the area, it was a matter for gardaí and not the county council, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Talks take place amid US frustration at slow pace of denuclearisationIn a town of just 11 people in Larrimah, everyone is a potential suspectBicycle-sharing dream has soured in ChinaEight bodies recovered in Papua after incident involving Dimonim Air flightIn the era of global warming, the Indian city of Kolkata is at profound risk.

He was last seen in the Australian outback town of Larrimah, where he lived. Photograph: courtesy ABC NewsDusk was falling on the sweltering hot day of December 16th, 2017, when Irishman Paddy Moriarty went to the Pink Panther, the only hotel and bar in this tiny, dusty town, to end the day with his usual round of drinks.He downed eight beers, typical for Moriarty, a labourer who emigrated from Ireland in the 1960s.Then he left for home with his dog by his side. He was never seen again. Neither was his dog, a Kelpie named Kellie.Four days later, when the police arrived in Larrimah, a Northern Territory town of just 11 people, they entered Moriarty’s unlocked house to find a cowboy hat on a cooler box and a barbecue chicken still in the microwave. The authorities suspect foul play and have been treating the case as a homicide, with every single person in Larrimah – all 11 of them – being probed for clues.Topping the list of potential suspects now – at least going by the questioning in a recent inquest involving the town’s residents – are a former Pink Panther bartender, who was one of the last people to see the missing man, and a gardener, with whom Moriarty had fought just days before his disappearance. Detectives have also questioned the owner of a roadside teahouse, leading to morbid jokes about the filling in her meat pies.But with no clear evidence or even a motive for Moriarty’s disappearance, every one of Larrimah’s 11 residents is in one way or another part of the investigation – with each pointing a finger at a neighbour or two, while denying their own involvement in what has become the latest mystery to capture Australia’s imagination.There are only two gathering places for residents and visitors, the Pink Panther and Fran’s Devonshire Tea House. I started with the former, a musty pub and hotel where Moriarty, 70, was last seen. “Paddy used to be here nearly every day, I miss him so much,” said one of Moriarty’s closest friends, Barry Sharpe, 76, the publican of the Pink Panther.All Sharpe said he knew about the disappearance was that his friend did not show up for “church”, a Sunday morning ritual in which residents gather in the Pink Panther’s front room to watch Landline, the nation’s premier rural affairs programme. It was then that locals sounded the alarm.A three-day search by foot, on four-wheel-drives and from the air ruled out death by misadventure. One of the last people to see Moriarty was Richard Simpson, the one-time bartender at the Pink Panther, who has a reputation for volatility. “He was every day drunk before lunch,” Sharpe said of Simpson, his former employee. “Not only smashed, but not very pleasant.”Simpson scoffed at similar accusations when asked about them during the coroner’s inquest, a public hearing in which witnesses are questioned in open court. Upon being told that some people in Larrimah thought he had something to do with the disappearance, Simpson declared them all fools.He instead suggested that the police should be looking elsewhere – down the main road at the Tea House. The next day, that’s where I went. “I’ve got no pies left,” a short woman with spiked blond hair shrieked from the kitchen. Recreational vehicles lined up outside as patrons spilled out to buy tea and pies, despite online reviews warning of “rubbish food” and questionable prices.The cook, Fran Hodgetts, 75, has long prided herself on her scones and meat pies. She often tells visitors they are famous around the world. Now, though, they are renowned for all the wrong reasons. “I reckon he’s in the pie,” joked Robyn Duignan, a visitor from Victoria who had been following Moriarty’s case in the news media and stopped by to see if there had been any developments. “He went through the mincer,” Duignan added from the Tea House’s garden, a yard scattered with old toys and signs trumpeting Hodgetts’ culinary expertise.Moriarty and Hodgetts were neighbours who often clashed, the police said. He lived directly across the main road from the Tea House, and several people in town said it had annoyed him when her customers parked on his property. As payback, residents said, Moriarty routinely told them not to eat her food because nothing was homemade or fresh, adding that even his dog would not eat her pies.If Moriarty had enemies, he also had allies: Years ago, when Sharpe, the publican from the Pink Panther, decided his crocodile Sam was not enough of an attraction, he started selling his own meat pies. Moriarty advertised those pies in front of his house with a massive sign that read: “Larrimah Hotel Best Pies in Town.”The testimony from Hodgetts, sitting on the stand in a tiny courtroom in the nearby town of Katherine, was part of an investigation by the Northern Territory coroner, a special magistrate assigned to determine the cause and manner of Moriarty’s death.Early on, the focus fell on Hodgetts. Bobby Roth, a Larrimah local of 19 years, who used to wash dishes at the Tea House, said the cafe owner didn’t like Moriarty. “She used to say, ‘I’ll kill Paddy,’” Roth said at one point, breaking into tears. But during her own testimony, Hodgetts ended up shifting attention to her gardener, Owen Laurie, 71, a tall, burly man who was known for keeping to himself, and for taking good care of the Tea House plants.The questioning centred on an argument that he and Moriarty had about Kellie, Moriarty’s dog, three days before they disappeared. That day, Kellie had been barking at the Tea House from a spot in the middle of the road. An argument between Moriarty and Laurie ensued, according to testimony, with Laurie shouting at Moriarty to shut the dog up “or I’ll shut it up for you.”Hodgetts went a step further, telling the court Laurie tried to “jump the fence.” “I told him, ‘Don’t do anything stupid,’” Hodgetts said. Laurie admitted to having a bad temper, but he denied any involvement, turning the court’s attention back to where Moriarty was last seen: The Pink Panther.Simpson no longer works at the pub. Sharpe said he was fired a week before the coroner’s inquest – a few days before I arrived to find his room there a mess of dirty clothes and empty beer cans. He appeared to have moved on and has since been replaced by someone else, keeping Larrimah’s population steady at 11. It used to be 12.Around the bar, patrons still talk about Moriarty’s disappearance. “Church” on Sundays has resumed, but without the charm Moriarty used to bring to it. Because he had no family in Australia, the public trustee now controls his property. To keep an eye on anything that might look suspicious, his home has been fitted with security cameras, and it’s flanked by a large missing-person sign.It includes a picture of Moriarty, smiling, with a question many in town are still asking: “What happened to Paddy?”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

It is thought the combination of the two ingredients kills more mosquitoes and reduces the number of infective bites. The study was the first clinical trial in the world to compare use of bed nets containing two active ingredients with the traditional net.As with therapies against diseases such as a tuberculosis, which use a combination of drugs in patients to help tackle antibiotic resistance, researchers say it is less likely for mosquitoes to become resistant to both chemicals in the combination bed nets.Malaria remains one of the world’s leading infectious killers. In 2016, the disease infected 216 million people across 91 countries, up five million from the previous year and killed 445,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.Some 80 per cent of malaria transmission occurs in Africa. Since 2000, there has been huge investment in malaria control on the continent which has halved the amount of malaria thanks mostly to distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and spraying of homes with mosquito-killing products.However, in the last three years progress against the disease has slowed – with numbers of infected people now increasing in some areas. Resistance to insecticides is thought to be one of the key causes  behind the stalling progress.“We are now entering a crucial point in the future history of malaria control globally and we need to have some good products,” said Prof Lindsay. “It’s an important contribution to the future of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa.”Although a mosquito net alone is able to protect against malaria transmission for iniduals, treated nets are crucial in the broader fight against the disease, as insecticides when effective help reduce the overall population of mosquitoes in a community – leading to much more significant declines in rates of malaria.“The critical thing with malaria control is to reduce the average life of a mosquito,” said Prof Lindsay.As well as reducing the rate of malaria, the researchers found that the new nets reduced anaemia rates among children sleeping under them by 52 per cent. Malaria anaemia which results from infection of red blood cells by malaria parasites is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old.The trial which was conducted by a team of scientists from the UK, Burkino Faso and Switzerland was limited to 40 rural areas in Burkino Faso. Going forward, the researchers say that the next step will be to expand the study to further countries in sub-Saharan Africa.Prof Lindsay is hopeful that following further successful trials the  World Health Organization will approve the new nets.Malaria still kills a child every two minutes so we need to keep working to find the best ways to stop this from happening. It is clear that conventional methods used for controlling malaria mosquitoes need to be improved and new additional tools developed, he said.“If we take our foot off the gas, malaria will come back to haunt us again,” he added.War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Bed nets are crucial in the fight against malaria and have come a long way since the first ones dipped in insecticide were used in Africa in the 1980s. Unlike modern long-lasting insecticidal nets, the insecticide in early nets was not able to withstand washing and had to be re-treated every six months – a logistical challenge in many rural areas.Dr James Tibenderana,  technical director at the Malaria Consortium who was not involved in the research said that resistance was a significant concern.“It’s quite worrying for us to find some of the insecticides are not as effective as they have been in the past,” he said.He said that pyrethroids are rare in that they can get into the yarn of the net effectively at a concentration that is both effective and safe  while being well-priced. “We will probably not get that ideal again so we will be dealing with new dynamics.” “We needed new nets four or five years ago so we are catching up. Whatever net we get now it’s going to take time to get it out there,” said Dr Tibenderana.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security   Turkey calls on US to \u0026#39remain loyal\u0026#39 to Nato alliance as Ankara cracks down on negative social mediaComment: EU leaders need to put prosperity ahead of dogma if we\u0026#39re to avoid a catastrophic No DealDrunk friends rescued from top of 300ft Coventry Cathedral after scaling ruins on night outEndangered killer whale carries her dead calf for \u0026#39record\u0026#39 17 days in \u0026#39tour of grief\u0026#39 captivating researchersUK weather: Britain on flood alert as thunderstorms to bring \u0026#39intense\u0026#39 rainKatie Piper announced as first Strictly Come Dancing contestantHappy Left-Handers Day! 13 facts about the wonderful leftSpain festival boardwalk collapse: Hundreds injured as platform falls into sea in VigoJohn Smyth victim calls for independent inquiry after he claims church \u0026#39marks its own exams\u0026#39South Korean president Moon Jae-in  to meet Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang for latest summitBoris Johnson offers reporters tea as he stays quiet over burka rowIran ‘gearing up to launch cyber strikes’ over US sanctions - andComment: As in the case of John Smyth QC, an abusive theology can lead to terrible actionsThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendInmate given 57p in compensation after his magazine was damaged by prison staffChristian camp abuse: \u0026#39I regret that I will never see John Smyth face justice.

It is because of America\u0027s sanctions and the South\u0027s unfair participation in them, it said through the state-run Uriminzokkiri website. Pyongyang has also hit out at the US, the United Nations and Japan since a historic June meeting between Kim and Donald Trump, the US president. North Korea has repeatedly called for the US to put an end to the Korean War – which ended in an armistice not a peace treaty – and to repeal crippling economic sanctions as a reward or Pyongyang’s show of good faith in ending its nuclear weapons testing.However, the US has maintained that the North’s failure to stop its nuclear and missiles programme, as evidenced in a recent UN report, is inconsistent with Kim’s commitment to rid his country of nuclear weapons. In a frosty statement issued by the North Korean permanent mission to the United Nations in New York, Pyongyang accused the US of “attempting to invent a pretext for increased sanctions.”It added that some high-level officials in the US administration were making “baseless accusations”, warning that “there is no guarantee that the hard-won atmosphere of stability on the Korean Peninsula will continue”.A separate statement also condemned the UN secretary general for saying that North Korea could be achieved through total denuclearisation that is “verifiable” and “irreversible”, signifying a stronger commitment than was agreed at earlier summits. Some believe a second meeting between Kim and President Trump could be a way to bring back the momentum to work towards peace, citing the UN General Assembly in New York next month as a convenient occasion to hold fresh talks. The White House has denied such a meeting is currently in the works but analysts believe it could take place in the margins of the assembly. Evans Revere, a former US diplomat, told The Daily Beast that Mr Trump “might be tempted to use that venue to put on a ‘show’ with his North Korean counterpart that would top what occurred in Singapore.Yet Washington is outwardly maintaining a firm line with Pyongyang. On Monday, Harry Harris, the new US ambassador to Seoul, said that it was too early to declare a formal end to the war or to lift sanctions. “The potential for positive change in North Korea is limitless,” the ambassador said, in comments reported by Yonhap.“But only if Chairman Kim fulfills his commitments to denuclearise. Sanctions will remain in place until North Korea takes concrete and verifiable steps toward denuclearisation. Our two nations are committed to choose the right deal, not just any deal,” he said.  Please review our commenting policyTurkey calls on US to \u0026#39remain loyal\u0026#39 to Nato alliance as Ankara cracks down on negative social mediaComment: EU leaders need to put prosperity ahead of dogma if we\u0026#39re to avoid a catastrophic No DealDrunk friends rescued from top of 300ft Coventry Cathedral after scaling ruins on night outEndangered killer whale carries her dead calf for \u0026#39record\u0026#39 17 days in \u0026#39tour of grief\u0026#39 captivating researchersUK weather: Britain on flood alert as thunderstorms to bring \u0026#39intense\u0026#39 rainKatie Piper announced as first Strictly Come Dancing contestantHappy Left-Handers Day! 13 facts about the wonderful leftSpain festival boardwalk collapse: Hundreds injured as platform falls into sea in VigoJohn Smyth victim calls for independent inquiry after he claims church \u0026#39marks its own exams\u0026#39Boris Johnson offers reporters tea as he stays quiet over burka rowIran ‘gearing up to launch cyber strikes’ over US sanctions - andComment: As in the case of John Smyth QC, an abusive theology can lead to terrible actionsThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendInmate given 57p in compensation after his magazine was damaged by prison staffChristian camp abuse: \u0026#39I regret that I will never see John Smyth face justice.

Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own.

The resale sites, controversial due to secondary sellers ramping up prices to make huge profits on tickets, will close from today onwards. The ticket selling firm said: “We’ve listened and we hear you: secondary sites just don’t cut it anymore and you’re tired of seeing others snap up tickets just to resell for a profit.”The firm said its new website, with the exchange service included, will be rolled out in October in the UK and Ireland, and across the rest of Europe early next year.Ticketmaster recently admitted that a number of customers who had bought or tried to buy tickets through its services, may have been affected by a cyber attack. Tens of thousands of UK consumers are believed to have been affected after malware was found inside third-party software running on Ticketmaster International, Ticketmaster, TicketWeb and Get Me In. Digital and creative industries minister Margot James welcomed the decision to shut down the sites, and said: We want real fans to be able to see their favourite artists and events at a fair price. “This is a welcome move from Ticketmaster and shows that they\u0027re following our lead and taking a tough stance on cracking down on unacceptable behaviour in the secondary ticket market.Get Me In and Seatwave were two of four major players in the tickets secondary market, with StubHub and Viagogo remaining.The competition watchdog has previously vowed to crack down on secondary ticketing websites due to concerns that some of them may be breaking the law by failing to give customers full information about events or venues.

Just under a third (28 per cent) said she should be replaced without a vote while 20 per cent said they did not know.But respondents were ided on whether the 2016 referendum result gave the prime minister a mandate to leave the EU without a deal, with 34 per cent believing it did and 36 per cent suggesting it did not.The new findings came as the People’s Vote campaign held a 700-strong rally at Bristol’s Colston Hall to demand a fresh referendum on the final Brexit deal.

The government are making a mess out of Brexit – but it is not a done deal.\u0026nbsp“I am delighted to come back to Bristol on 11 August\u0026nbspto join the hundreds of people calling for a People’s Vote.

So they put it out for a referendum.\u0026ldquoNow, it comes back that we want to leave, and the whole of parliament, therefore, should to some extent, be behind working for leave.\u0026ldquoWhat annoys me is, not only parliament but also some members of the Conservative Party are actually wanting to overturn that.

This ides their supporters and it certainly ides the Parliamentary parties.Theresa May has been facing mounting pressure from the Conservative parliamentary party since she published her latest Brexit white paper.Brexiteers have criticised her blueprint for proposing Britain remains closely linked through the creation of a free trade area administered with a common rulebook.Several MPs, including former frontbencher Priti Patel and Lewes MP Maria Caulfield, expressed their support for the campaign #StandUp4Brexit \u0026ndash a campaign launched by Conservative activists demanding Mrs May delivers on Leave voters\u0027 demands.\u0026nbspMs Caulfield said: I\u0026rsquom standing up for Brexit by rejecting the Chequers deal because I promised my constituents at the General Election last year that, whether they voted Leave or Remain, that I would absolutely stand up and get them the possible deal for them and this country as we leave the EU in March Next year.It will make it very, very difficult indeed for us to be able to set up free trade agreements with countries outside the EU because of the close regulatory alignment we\u0026rsquoll have to follow under the common rulebook.It has the Northern Ireland backstop within it, which means that if we try and move away from the EU in any meaningful way, Northern Ireland will be made to keep in close line with the EU while the rest of the UK makes its own way. That is absolutely unacceptable. We need to be one United Kingdom as we go forward.The third reason is that we promised to \u0026lsquotake back control, and with the oversight of the European Court of Justice we really won\u0026rsquot have left the EU.She concluded: We will have left in name only. For me, Chequers is Brexit in name only.For those three reasons, and there are many others, I\u0026rsquom going to stand up for Brexit and say chuck Chequers.

We’re losing more and more of our natural wildlife. Our open spaces diminish daily.And now the Government is being forced into building countless millions of homes. Why?We’re told we have a housing crisis. You might find this puzzling when you consider the birth rate in Britain has been dropping, not rising.The answer, of course, is immigration. We’ve been letting in half a million people every year for almost 15 years.The politicians try to tell you it’s nothing to do with our housing crisis — but they are lying. Lying to themselves and to you.One top academic expert, Oxford demographer David Coleman, reckons immigration is 85 per cent responsible for the rise in the UK’s population between 2000 and 2015.And the other figures you might find a bit chilling.Did you know, for example, that a whopping 28 per cent of all births in the UK are to foreign-born women? And the figure in London is a staggering 60 per cent.If you find an indigenous British person in London, say hello to him for me and wish him the best. He’s the last of a dying breed. White Brits are a minority in our capital.It’s not just that. The birth rate for British people is 1.75. The birth rate for immigrants is 2.06. That’s a very big difference.So not only do we let in half a million per year, but they have more kids and so doubly contribute to population growth and the need for new houses.Oh, and the need for lots of other very expensive stuff, such as schools, hospitals, welfare benefits and so on.We MUST call a halt to immigration. The overwhelming majority of the population thinks we need much tougher controls.And there are many people who think that immigration has not made the country any better, but actually made it worse.Cut the numbers coming in to 10,000 per year and our housing crisis would begin to lessen, given that 300,000 or so people emigrate every year.A net decrease in the population would massively reduce the need for new housing.Because unless we do that, the bulldozers will be moving in. The fields, hedges and woodland will be ripped up. The roads will be laid and the peace and quiet shattered.And this will not be a green and pleasant land for much longer.Katie Price has just managed to avoid being declared bankrupt.She’s been given three months to pay off a whole load of creditors, plus a whopping tax bill.Everyone seems shocked that she has apparently blown £45million.But that body needs a lot of upkeep. She spends thousands every month getting her nails done so they look really chavvy.And then there’s the periodic scaffolding required to keep those vast mammaries aloft – plus a bit of pointing and retiling.The surprise to me was how in the name of hell she managed to amass £45million, not how she managed to spend it.For doing WHAT exactly?A woman on a flight from Valencia to London apparently “bonded” with a “hot guy”.Now Jo Lia has launched a Facebook campaign to trace the poor bugger.She says he was called “Joe” and looked a bit like Jordan Henderson. Hmmm. But can he pass the ball sideways just as well? I bet she didn’t find that out. Anyway, above is a photo of Ms Lia.So Joe, mate – keep your head down and stay off social media for a while. If I had that loon sitting next to me on a plane I’d spend the entire flight in the khazi.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn appeared on the Iranian-run Press TV to cast doubt on Israel’s right to exist.He used to get paid handsomely for his appearances on a network run by a hostile government which enslaves its own people.Meanwhile, more Labour anti-Semites have been crawling out of the woodwork.Here’s a suggestion. Clearly Labour has no intention of kicking out its Jew-haters.So I would suggest everyone in the party who ISN’T anti-Semitic get the hell out right now.And leave the party to the racist, hard-left rabble who are currently running it.The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig says that people mistake her for Tom Cruise.It’s easy to see why, isn’t it? Spitting image.Oddly enough, people often mistake me for the model Chloe Ayling.I even had the police round when she went missing because someone reckoned they’d seen her in Thornaby. But it was just me, nipping out for some fags.Our former Foreign Secretary is in trouble for having said that Muslim women wearing the full burka look like postboxes, or bank robbers.But that’s pretty much what most think, isn’t it?Boris was against banning the burka. But increasingly I think we should follow most of our European friends and outlaw the ridiculous garment in public places.Almost half of British 18 to 24 year olds don’t know when World War One took place, according to a survey.And hardly any of them could name the prime minister – David Lloyd George – who led us to victory.But it’s not really their fault, is it? Truth is, they’re not taught stuff like this any more.The history curriculum has been pretty much stripped of things which shows Britain in a good light, or British people being the victims of aggression.Instead, they learn very dubious arguments about slavery and colonialism.It’s a dangerous thing. When you lose a sense of pride in your nation, you also start to lose respect for its authority and its laws.And you raise a generation of perpetually whining airheads who understand nothing of the sacrifices made by Britons in the past.YOU see? They take their dieting really seriously up here in the North East. Pizza, chicken and chips. My missus took this pic, above, in a Teesside café.She once spent two weeks trying to find a salad in Austria, with no luck.The BBC is about to spend more than two million quid on a propaganda campaign to make you pay its licence fee.This is as opposed to the rest of its budget, which is spent on a propaganda campaign to convince you that all immigration is good, Israel is evil and Brexit a catastrophe.Fewer and fewer people watch the BBC.The licence fee has become an absurdity – an unjust tax which growing numbers of people simply refuse to pay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’d never want authorities to have a free pass to snoop into our lives.But when cops are confident that the missing piece to a case can be found online, it is outrageous that web giants don’t work with them to investigate.They act as if they’re above the law.Let’s see about that.THE new Civil Society Strategy is better than its clunky name suggests.As a general rule, putting power in the hands of local people — rather than leaving it with far-off Whitehall civil servants — is usually a good idea.It is residents who know which roads need fixing, which bins need collecting, and which social care services are struggling.And for all the know-how of local councillors, too many are in safe seats and not solely motivated by serving their voters.Between plans for “citizen juries” and freeing up cash for community organisations, this should be a much-needed boost for local democracy — with the cash to back positive initiatives.The ironic thing is that it all sounds very familiar.It used to be called the Big Society.DAVID Jason reckons Del Boy would have been relaxed about Brexit.Of course he would.

After the British people voted to leave the European Union we were told “Brexit means Brexit” and that critical “red lines” would guide our negotiations with the EU. So far, so good.Fast forward to today and we live in a different world. The so-called Chequers Agreement crosses all those red lines.We are dancing the hokey cokey with the Customs Union and Single Market, which means restricting our freedom for new free trade agreements.These, of course, are critical to the national economic success of Brexit. European regulations will remain in force — with no input from the UK. So we stay under the rule of European courts and provide a back door for continued freedom of movement for EU nationals into Britain.Our laws and courts will not be supreme as Chequers would leave us being run by remote control from Brussels.To frighten us into submission we are spoon-fed a daily diet of tales of food shortages, soldiers in the streets and tailbacks from Dover to Land’s End.But the political graveyards are full of people who underestimated the good sense of the British people, the very people who want to be in command of their own destiny and who don’t want to be taken advantage of by the EU.And don’t forget that despite Project Fear in the referendum, the majority still voted to Leave and the fear-mongering was proven false.So false that the fear of recession and job losses was met by a growing economy, UK manufacturing output growing at its fastest rate in a decade, exports to the US in 2016 exceeding £100billion — more than twice as much as exports to any other country — and the fact that our economy is worth more than £2trillion and is the sixth largest in the world.Project Fear was proven false and so will this latest version of fear, which speaks volumes about what the Government thinks of voters — sheep to frighten into the right pen. But sheep we are not.I’ve spent the past few weeks meeting party activists, businesses and the public, supporters of Leave and Remain from across the country and the view is that Chequers will give us neither our economic nor political freedom.Their concerns are simple. There can be no halfway house, where Britain continues to be out of Europe in name but is still run by Europe.There can be no halfway house when it comes to rule-taking and law-making from the EU, and there is an overwhelming sense of frustration that Britain is being taken advantage of by the EU.And across the heartlands of the UK this matters, as these people are the ones who have been left behind and who are desperate to take back control of our laws, our borders and our money. There will also be long-term consequences if the largest democratic vote in British history is frustrated.We will face a crisis of democracy in which ordinary people will utterly lose their faith and trust in politics and in politicians. The implications for political parties at the polls when they fail to deliver is clear, the public will stop voting for them. We cannot ignore the people.The Conservative Party could throw away hard-won gains in pro-Leave constituencies across the North East and Midlands if we continue to compromise on the referendum and concede ground to Brussels.Across Europe we have seen political parties and governments do exactly that and the result is a wave of terrifying extreme forms of nationalism and populism. That is not the British way because when our governments deliver, they deliver for our country and our people.The time has come for our political leaders to believe in Britain and in the British people. They should abandon the weak-kneed approach and instead play to our strengths. Britain wants to secure a trade deal with the EU and seeks to establish a “strong and special partnership” with them.Talk of no deal really means no trade deal, and if the EU fails to reach a free trade agreement with Britain, in the long term we can thrive under World Trade Organisation rules. The UK exports to 111 countries under WTO rules and over the past 23 years this grew at a rate which was three times faster than those exporting to the major EU nations.We also know that the European Commission, thanks to the many political problems across the European Union, desperately needs British taxpayers to foot the “exit payment” of £39billion to balance its budget.And 1.2million EU jobs depend on selling goods to Britain, with London providing much-needed financing to EU businesses. Brexit will not be easy.There is hard work to do but we are up to the task. We are a free and independent country and will prosper if given a proper chance.But to let the British lion roar again the first step is to chuck Chequers.The Prime Minister assures us freedom of movement will end and that we’ll be able to do trade deals. Others, including former Cabinet ministers such as Ms Patel, believe otherwise.It is time for the Prime Minister to sell the Chequers deal directly to the country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn about her reality TV romances rarely last beyond the first glossy magazine spread.I’M not in the least bit surprised that doctors don’t trust us to tell the truth when it comes to how much booze we guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for likening woman who wear burkas to letter boxes.It’s his opinion.You very well might disagree, but getting him to say sorry won’t make him stop thinking such thoughts.He will just stop writing and uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It looked pretty amazing to me. Maybe it was luck, I dont know.Harrowing audio revealed the pilot joking with the controllers who begged him to land the 76-seater plane before it nosedived and burst into a fireball 25 miles from takeoff.He also told them he was a broken man and apologised to the air traffic controller, saying: I hope this doesnt ruin your day.At one point, he said: Hey do you think if I land this successfully Alaska will give me a job as a pilot?Astonishing video showed the plane doing large loops and other dangerous manoeuvres.The deadly excitement was clearly far removed from Russells daily grind as a seemingly bored baggage handler.A video he posted on YouTube gave an insight into his work for Horizon Airlines which mainly involved loading and unloading luggage for around £10 an hour.The second half of the two-minute video is devoted to Russells travels, featuring photos and videos from his different trips around the world.During the hijacking Russell, known as Rich, told controllers he wanted to do a barrel roll, and if that goes good... nose down and call it a night.He added: I wouldnt know how to land - I wasnt really planning on landing it.Russell, who dreamed of joining the military, then said that he had thrown up and that he felt dizzy, adding: Im sorry about this, I hope it doesnt ruin your day.Man, the sights went by so fast. I was thinking, like, Im going to have this moment of serenity, take in all the sights. Theres a lot of pretty stuff, but theyre pretty in a different context.Q: WHY did he do it?A: FBI agents are seeking a motive. Police said he was “suicidal” in exchan­g­es with air traffic control.Q: COULD he have flown with no experience?A: EXPERTS said he could — but believe his stunts were most likely practised using a flight simulator.Last night his family said they were “devastated” in a short statement. It read: “This is a complete shock to us.“We are devastated by these events, and Jesus is truly the only one holding this family together right now.”It added Russell was a “faithful husband, a loving son and a good friend.”Russell, who ran a bakery with his wife Hannah until it shut down in 2015, crashed on Ketron Island, 30 miles south west of Seattle, at 8pm local time.He met Hannah in 2010 when they were both in school and married her one year later, according to one of his blog posts.In his call to air traffic controllers, the man also described him as having a few screws lose but didnt realise until now.It is still unclear how Russell, who is not believed to have a pilots licence, managed to steal the jet and get it into the air without anyone noticing.Sheriff Paul Pastor confirmed there were no passengers on board the plane and the incident was not terror-related, just a joyride gone terribly wrong.Investigator Eckrote said it was very lucky the plane avoided nosediving into a populated area.Eyewitnesses said they saw the aircraft being followed by military planes and videos of the aircraft flying circuits were posted online.The Pierce County Sheriffs Office said on Twitter the crash may have been caused by the man doing stunts in air or lack of flying skills.Troyer said F-15 aircraft scrambled out of Portland, Oregon, and were in the air within a few minutes and the pilots kept people on the ground safe.The sheriffs department said they were working to conduct a background investigation on the Pierce County resident.It stolen at 8pm, and Alaska Airlines said it was in a maintenance position - meaning it was not scheduled for a passenger flight.Horizon Air is part of Alaska Air Group and flies shorter routes throughout the west of the United States.The Q400 is a turboprop aircraft with 76 seats.Pierce County Sheriff Pastor said the man did something foolish and may well have paid with his life.Rick Christenson, a retired operational supervisor for Horizon Air, said of his aerobatics: “For him to do that, I would think he played in a simulator. It looked pretty amazing — maybe it was luck.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426226103.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man goes pint after work wakes up magaluf","story":"Alun Griffiths, 27, received a phone call from his partner who said foods ready as he touched down on the Spanish resort.My Mrs rang me saying where are you?, said Alun, who flew to Palma with pal Nigel Lewis after going for after work drinks on Tuesday.After landing the duo hopped in a taxi and headed to party town Magaluf for a two day bender.He added: I said Im in Magaluf and she said foods ready and I said Im not joking, I wont be home for a few days.She wasnt best pleased.Alun, from Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, called in at Gurnos Club on his way home from work, planning to have a few drinks with friends.He told Wales Online: I was in work on Tuesday morning and Id woken up in a stupid mood when you just get a feeling youre going to do something stupid.After work I went to the Gurnos Club and there was about 15 of us all talking about holidays.

They were given two Viagra pills every a day for two years.The results showed the drug, which this year became available over the counter in Britain, stopped the condition in its tracks for four participants and significantly improved the eyesight of one.Researchers said: Viagra offers significant potential for vision retention and recovery. It is notable that patients remained visually stable and there was a significant improvement in vision in one participant.Dry AMD, the slow acting form of the disease that takes several years to manifest, affects around 90 per cent of cases in the UK.The rest suffer the more rapid wet AMD, which can cause blindness in as little as three months.Dry AMD usually develops after the age of 50 and is caused by the growth of new blood vessels over the macula, a small oval-shaped area at the back of the eye needed to pick out visual details clearly.Fluid leaks from the blood vessels, causing scar tissue to form and ruin vision in the centre of the eye.Sufferers of the condition find it difficult to read, watch television and even recognise faces.Other research has found that AMD is partyl caused by resduced blood flow to vital parts of eye tissue in front of the retina.The latest results, published in the journal of Ophthalmologica, compliment earlier studies suggested Viagra can improve blood flow.Professor Sobha Sivaprasad from the Royal College of Ophthalmologists said the Viagra findings were encouraging, although the study was small.We now need bigger studies to replicate these findings before Viagra can be used as a treatment, she cautioned.Some drugs can already slow the progression of AMD and increase vision, but they have to be injected into the back of the eye every month.Viagra cold also help a string of ailments, including heart attacks, lung disease and dementia, previous studies have suggested."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000000507559.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"heatwave homes sinking into ground insurance claims quadruple","story":"Insurers say they expect subsidence claims to QUADRUPLE as individual bills topping £50,000 send premiums soaring.The two-month heatwave has caused the foundation soil to shrink which will see many sinking into the ground later this year, reports the .Symptoms of subsidence like cracked walls usually appear several months after the damage is done which means some homeowners may not even know theyve got problems until Christmas.Those particularly badly hit propertties can take up to take a year to fix causing major upheaval to the homeowners.And to make things worse those affected could receive a double blow as their insurance bills may soar because firms no longer want to insure them, experts warned.Last year there were around 12,000 insurance claims for subsidence, industry figures show, but this year the figure could rise to nearly 50,000 cases.A source from one of Britains biggest insurers told the newspaper it was expecting four times as many claims as usual because of the heatwave. Another firm said it thought claims could double.Trevor Abrahmsohn, of property firm Glentree, warned some homeowners may even have to leave their homes for safety reasons.He said: “Subsidence can be so severe that it has required, in some cases, the complete rebuilding of the property, during which, the homeowner has had to move out of the property and into alternative accommodation while their home is made safe.Subsidence can cost up to £50,000 to fix, however in most cases this cost is covered by buildings insurance, meaning homeowners are spared the bill.Rod Jones, of price comparison website uSwitch, said: “If your house suffers, or has historically suffered from subsidence, it can result in your buildings insurance premium being higher than normal.In some instances, this could even mean an insurer being unwilling to cover your property.”Subsidence occurs when the soil below a property shifts, causing cracks to appear in the walls of the building.During periods of extended hot weather the soil below homes contracts more than normal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can it fly? How did you land it here?We get customers coming all the way from Holland to see it - theyre amazed its just sat in the back of the beer garden.He added: Its honestly the best £100 I have ever spent, and thats not just because of the increase in customers, but weve not stopped working on it since.Paul proudly says the large garden ornament is a real pull with customers at his pub The Standard in Northallerton, North Yorks.Captain Greig, as he is now known by locals, recalls placing the bid just in the nick of time with two minutes left before the auction closed.The band of brothers have spent hundreds of hours doing up the aircraft, working on the project at weekends.Following a painstaking restoration, the plane is now equipped with fully working cockpit and landing lights.Paul said: My garden was the biggest so I decided to put it in - it took just half a day to crane it over from the neighbours yard in four pieces.It all depends on the weather - and while running a pub I usually have my hands full.The plane had been painted over and painted over and we stripped it all back and worked and worked on it.We are all complete amateurs but have a love for aircrafts - its a real hobby and we enjoy working on it.Paul became obsessed with planes after spending his childhood living in a flight path of Edinburgh airport.He says the hardest part of the restoration project is finding parts which now no longer exist.Asked about the hidden secret being unearthed, Paul said: Its funny because its being here all this time and weve never had any publicity until a journalist wandered in and was taken aback.I dont know if it the best - but I cant say I know of any other pubs that have a jet in the beer garden.The jet had flown out of RAF Linton on Ouse in the early 1960s.Before the plane was transported to Pauls pub June 2005, it had spent the last five years in a field alongside other war machines, including at tank, in Sussex.The previous owner had also saved it from scrap when he bought it from a museum in South Wales after it closed.He said: I basically wanted to stop it from being put on the scrap heap and the bloke that was selling it wanted to downsize after his wife had died.Adding: Its a bit of British aviation heritage which I couldnt let go to waste.Jet Provost air-planes were used as jet trainers and Pauls model was built in Luton as an RAF jet trainer.The plane entered service in 1960 at Linton-on-Ouse and was used until 1973."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000245906892-e1534103039990.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british army berets eu contract","story":"Lucrative deals for the headgear, shirts and even ceremonial uniforms are on a list of tenders put out across the European Union.A £140million deal for ration packs is also being advertised across the bloc.A final decision is yet to be taken on any of the contracts.But it follows a row earlier this summer after the Ministry of Defence had met with shipyards from Germany to South Korea over a £1billion deal for three new Royal Navy cargo ships.Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith stormed: “It looks like the Government has given up on making things in Britain.“For a contract like this, the Government should first be looking is there is a British company that can fulfil the requirement at a fair price to the taxpayer.“It doesn’t send a message of confidence if our own Government chooses to look elsewhere as the first option.”Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said that while he didn’t want to be “protectionist”, defence should be a “special area” given the need to ensure security of supply. He added: “I do find it concerning that British suppliers are being undercut in this way.”Theresa May suffered a British-first backlash in April when it emerged a contract to make the UK’s new blue passports had been awarded to a Franco-Dutch firm. Labour launched a ‘Build it in Britain’ campaign last month – demanding a “fairer future” for UK industry.MoD sources said that by existing law all contracts have to be advertised across the the UK and EU.Small UK firms have won key MoD contracts in the past with Wyedean Weaving bagging a four year contract in 2013 for “ceremonial accoutrements”. The Yorkshire company has previously supplied berets to the Royal Bermuda Regiment.Pooley Sword in Sussex won a £750,000 contract for ceremonial swords and scabbards in the same year.Military chiefs famously worried about a shortage of binoculars at the start of WW1 as 60 per cent of optical glass came from Germany.A deal to secure a top-up to supplies was negotiated with the Germans in 1915 – at the height of the conflict – with Britain sending rubber in exchange.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t expect to see her or hear back from her — and that’s OK.“All I was doing was saying things I wanted to say. I just want to re-establish the relationship with my daughter.“I now want to go away on vacation somewhere and try to get some peace.”Ex-lighting director Thomas did not receive a birthday card from Meghan last month, despite sending two to her when she turned 37 on August 4.He is still desperate to hear from the new royal, but recognises that she may never come back to him following a series of devastating interviews.The pair have not spoken since the day after she married Prince Harry, 33, in May.Thomas — who missed the Windsor Castle wedding after heart surgery — said he still hoped Meghan would look after him when he grows older.Speaking about his relationship with his daughter, he said wistfully: “She is even further away now than she was before.“I just want a father-daughter relationship. If that means Christmas cards, birthday cards and getting together for the holidays — that is what I want.“The other thing is — this will sound a little greedy —   but I took care of my mother for the last five years of her life.“My daughter said she’d take care of me in my declining years. I’m not talking money, I’m talking about taking care of me. That’s important to me.”Thomas, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, sparked fresh turmoil yesterday by recalling how he hung up on Harry during a heated telephone conversation.He was in Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center in San Diego, having had surgery following a heart attack days before the wedding.But he said that when Harry and Meghan called, the Prince, who had warned him not to speak to the media, said: “This is what happens when you don’t listen to what we tell you to do.”It was days after Thomas was caught co-operating with a pa­parazzi snapper.He said: “I was recovering from a heart attack, lying in a bed, having a phone call, and the things were being said that hurt me. I felt disrespected by them.“I felt like I was being blamed for my mistakes when I was in my hospital bed recovering from a heart attack. I felt like I had to defend myself.”Thomas added to a friend: “I just had surgery and I’m laying in a f***ing bed. This changed my attitude.“I followed all this b****** protocol all year and it was the last f***ing thing I needed.“My response was, ‘Would you rather have me dead so you can cry about it’?”Meghan’s brother Tom Jr, 51 said she had changed since joining the royal family.He told the Mirror: “They say blood is thicker than water, but perhaps the blue blood of the royals now runs through Meg’s veins.“It’s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family.“Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.”Meghan’s half-sister Samantha, 53, also slammed the princess for appearing to turn her back on their father.She said: “There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is.“She should be grateful. Her diplomacy skills suck and are inhumane.“If you treat your own father like this, Harry is next.”She added: “Freezing people out is the best way of hiding the truth.”Samantha continued: “There is no room for a greedy arrogant, deceitful fake humanitarian on this world stage. How dare she? Disgusting.”In May though the presenter of Good Morning Britain Piers Morgan accused Samantha of being a “vulture” and making the most of her connections by “popping up on the airwaves and making a lot of money”.A spokeswoman for Kensington Palace declined to comment when approached by The Sun Online.Thomas told them they could “pretend to be sad” and hung up the tense call.He admitted that although he was upset, Harry was right to criticise him for co-operating with the photographer, having al­ready lied about the staged pictures.Thomas had denied collaborating with the snapper for a series of shots, including one of him being measured for a suit, until conclusive CCTV pictures were published.He told The Sun: “When the suit measurement pictures came out, Harry asked, ‘Did you really do these pictures’? I lied and said I was being measured for a hoodie.“I thought at this point I would get away with it. But then it was exposed and I told Meghan and Harry I would not go to the wedding.“They said not to worry about it and wanted me to go.”Thomas had already been upset after not receiving one of 600 official invitations sent out for his daughter’s wedding.Neither was he visited by the British consulate in LA, who he says arrived at the home of Meghan’s mum Doria to present a scroll bearing the Queen’s ­formal announcement.More upsetting was the news that there was no room for him to make a speech during the wedding celebrations.Thomas says he told Harry over the phone that he would like to “make a little speech” at the ceremony, but was informed he would have to speak to Meghan.She is then said to have told him there was “no room” for the “cute story” he had prepared.Thomas, who also spoke to The Mail on Sunday, said: “The speech was about the calls Meghan made to me when she told me about Harry.”Despite accepting his relationship with his daughter could be over, Thomas said he wished the new royal couple all the best.He previously told The Sun on Sunday that he believed Meghan looked “terrified” in her role as a duchess — but now believes she will be a “motherly” wife to Harry.Thomas said: “Meghan is very maternal by nature. She loves to cook and she will mother Harry.“He’s eating properly now, he’s dressing the way she wants him to. All men need that.”Thomas says his rift with Meghan began after his eldest daughter Samantha, 53, and 51-year-old son Tom Jnr — from his first marriage to Roslyn — made openly critical comments about the Duchess.Thomas said: “Meghan asked me to tell Samantha to stop talking about her and then asked me to stop talking to Samantha.“I have two daughters. I can’t stop talking to one of them.No father should be asked to turn his back on their children. I love Meghan, but I also love Samantha.”But he also called for his ­children to stop criticising Meghan.Estranged Tom Jnr, who urged Harry to dump Meghan weeks bef­ore the wedding, was photographed meeting his dad last month.But Thomas insisted it was an ambush.He said: “I’ve already expressed a message and that is for them all to shut up. Tom ambushed me — it wasn’t a reunion I had planned.“He followed me to an ATM and came up to me saying, ‘You’re a hard man to find’. I said I had nothing to say to him, but he kept babbling on.“I said, ‘Are you here with the Press’? and he said no. Then photographs appear in a newspaper.”Thomas said he “loathed” the circus his life had become and said he wanted to leave Mexico to get back his “boring” life of anonymity.He said Meghan and Harry would remember him with the “Markle nose” in their grandchildren — and went on: “I wish them well, but this isn’t going to make or break me.“I love Harry, I love my daughter. I wish them all the love and best wishes for the future. But I am not sitting here crying.“I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it. I’m done.”Kensington Palace was contacted for comment last night.She failed to send him a birthday card last month — and did not reply when he sent her two cards on her birthday nine days ago.One of the cards he sent included the note.Thomas said: “I wrote, ‘I didn’t fake the heart attack. I really wanted to be with you. Love, Daddy’.”His other card featured singing animals and a message reading: “Happy Birthday, love Daddy.”He said: “I addressed them to Duchess Meghan. I’ve heard nothing.”Thomas also dismissed reports that he has an unhealthy diet based on junk food takeaways.He said: “I get take-out fish from McDonald’s.“I’ve lost 40lb since my heart attack.“I eat fish and vegetables and stay on a 2,000 calorie-a-day diet.”Thomas also clarified his bankruptcies. He said: “I’ve actually had two.One 25 years ago and a recent one for a small amount — only because I was p***** off at credit card companies.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since it was announced, the Conservative Party’s position in the polls has slumped four points while support for Ukip has more than doubled.“This is clearing the road to Number 10 Downing Street for Jeremy Corbyn.”He adds: “Put simply the Conservatives are between a very hard rock and a hard place.”Theresa May enraged Eurosceptics by proposing to remain tied to EU rules for goods in her Brexit compromise plan.Grassroots activists also fear further concessions will be made on immigration to seal a deal by October.A separate poll yesterday by pro-EU group Best for Britain claimed up to 100 of constituencies that voted Leave would now back Remain, including Boris Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge and 14 of 40 seats in Wales.But support for Leave has edged higher in ardent Europhile Ken Clarke’s constituency of Rushcliffe as well as areas such as Edinburgh South-West, Finchley in north London and Somerton in the south-west.It bases the findings on a nationwide 5-point swing to Remain.In the twelve polls since Chequers, Corbyn’s Labour has been ahead or drawn even with the Conservative Party in all but one.Labour’s average rating in the polls is now inching ahead the Conservative Party’s.Make no mistake: unless things change Prime Minister Corbyn and Chancellor McDonnell is not just plausible but likely.This means that were a general election held tomorrow then dozens of Conservative MPs would be at risk of losing their seats.This is especially true in the most marginal constituencies where most people voted to leave the European Union in 2016 but where defections to Ukip or disillusioned Conservative Leavers simply not bothering to vote at all could easily push seats from the blue into the red column -seats like Southampton Itchen, Thurrock, Hastings and Rye, Stoke on Trent South and Mansfield and Bolton West.The fundamental problem for Prime Minister May is that while her party has already lost ground among Remainers, young millennials and large parts of the middle-class, her soft position on Brexit is now alienating the very Leavers, pensioners and working-class voters who flocked to the Conservatives at the election last year.This is the key point. Unlike the era of David Cameron, the era of Theresa May has seen the Conservative electorate become more blue-collar and more pro-Brexit - it is now stacked with voters who are expecting a meaningful deal on Brexit and, crucially, immigration.Many of these voters had previously had a one-night stand with Ukip , voting for Nigel Farage’s party before returning to the Conservatives in 2017.The risk now is that they abandon the Conservatives once again for another fling.There are also other problems. In fact, I can see a perfect storm gathering above the Conservative Party. On one level, the party’s recent drop in the polls and even a semi-resurgent Ukip will make it even easier for Corbyn to continue hoovering up marginal but pro-Remain and often more affluent seats like Pudsey, Chipping Barnet, Hendon and Putney.Meanwhile, elsewhere a Brexit deal that fails to rally Leavers will also make it that much harder for the Conservative Party to win back seats that were lost to Labour last year, like Kensington and Chelsea, Canterbury and Crewe and Nantwich.And it will also put current Labour seats where lots of people voted for Brexit firmly beyond the grasp of the Conservatives, such as Dudley North, Barrow and Furness, Ashfield, Bishop Auckland, or Newcastle-under-Lyme.Put simply, the Conservatives are stuck between a very hard rock and a hard place.They should do all that they can to avoid another election for as long as possible. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stop stalking me.In one lengthy example, which has been edited to protect the identities of its subjects, Thomas said of one familys case: Today I hated my job!I had to return a *-year-old and a *-year-old to their mother, an alcoholic, who took an overdose in front of them.The * year-old was so distraught at having to go back she soiled and then wet herself, she wrung her hands and sobbed.I hope those that made the crappy decision have the same nightmares I will now have.North East Lincolnshire Council said Thomas was immediately removed from working with families as soon as it was made aware of the posts.A spokesperson for the council said: The person concerned is not one of our staff, but is employed by an accredited agency the Council uses to help support its work in this important field -

Boardman, whose own mum was killed by a truck when cycling in 2016, said he felt was left seething after seeing the message on the official party Twitter feed.   Cycling minister Jesse Norman apologised after the message sparked a hail of angry responses from bike-users.  It came as Mr Norman announced plans for new road safety laws, including offences of causing death by dangerous or careless cycling, which would see cyclists who kill pedestrians treated in a similar way to drivers.  Mr Norman insisted that the changes were intended to protect vulnerable road users, including cyclists. But cycling campaigners said he was simply tinkering around the edges of road safety. The laws are being proposed by the Government after 44-year-old mother-of-two Kim Briggs was knocked over and killed by a bicycle courier in February 2016.  The message on the Conservative Twitter feed said: We\u0027re launching a consultation into dangerous cycling so that our most vulnerable road users are protected. Boardman responded: That says it all really. Wow, just wow. I genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account. Urging other cyclists to complain to Mr Norman and his party, he added: It\u0027s not me that needs to know how you feel - that\u0027s me, with the dead mother, crushed to death by a car by the way. It makes me feel genuinely sick. Carol Boardman died aged 75 when she was run over by a pick-up truck while on a bike ride near Connah\u0027s Quay in north Wales.  BBC radio presenter Jeremy Vine also spoke out about the Tory message. When I\u0027m on a bike, I\u0027m a vulnerable road user, said Vine. In 2016 there were 1,700 road deaths three were caused by cyclists.  Announcing that the tweet had been taken down, Mr Norman said: It did not reflect either this set of policy announcements or the very careful work the Government has done to improve road safety for all users, including cyclists. On behalf of all involved, I would like to apologise.  Mr Boardman said Norman was one of the good guys, if only his party would empower him to do more. In recent weeks the Department for Transport has announced a series of measures to protect vulnerable road users, including:  Funding to give driving instructors training to ensure cyclists\u0027 safety is prioritised. Better investigation of crashes. Investing \u0026pound100 million to improve dangerous roads.   The latest announcement includes the introduction of national guidance for cycling and walking infrastructure and updating parts of the Highway Code to combat close passing of bicycles. Ms Briggs\u0027 widower Matthew supports the proposed new laws. He said: This public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences.  Ms Briggs was killed by Charlie Alliston, then 18, who was travelling at 18mph on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail after being found guilty of causing bodily harm by wanton and furious driving. The Victorian legislation, originally drafted to deal with reckless handling of horses, was used because there was no cycling equivalent to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. Department for Transport (DfT) figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain\u0027s roads, but only three cases involved bicycles. National charity Cycling UK claimed a full review of road traffic offences is required.

The Tory MP admitted around half had already been committed to tackling homelessness and rough sleeping. And he told the BBC’s Today programme the other \u0026pound50 million was “reprioritisation” from within existing budgets - so will be paid for through cuts and ‘underspends’ elsewhere. Last night, Brokenshire’s Parliamentary Private Secretary Chris Philp claimed it was all ‘new money’.  He told the BBC’s Westminster Hour: “As I understand it, yes, this is new money, which is good news.” Asked to confirm if the \u0026pound100m announced today was all ‘new money’, he repeated: “Yes.” On the same programme, Mr Philp also falsely claimed the number of rough sleepers is now lower than it was when the Tories came to power. “That number is by the way lower than it was when the last labour government left office in 2010,” he said. He admitted the figure had gone up in the last year, but claimed: “In recent years it’s been rising but it’s still lower than it was when Labour left office.” This is untrue. According to government figures, the number of people sleeping rough was estimated at around 1,768. The most recent estimate for 2017 was 4,751 - a total estimated increase of 169% since the Tories came to power.

But before your kids will be happy riding on the road they\u0027ll need to have some practice. This might include tarmac-surfaced bike paths or very quiet roads. But as they get better on two wheels you\u0027ll want to help them get used to road cycling to prepare them for when they\u0027re ready to venture out alone. 1. First thing to do: get their bike checked  Before you set out on any bike ride, make sure everything is in good shape for the ride ahead.  Halfords offer a Free Bike Check , giving you complete confidence without having to get your hands dirty. In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too.   2. Start traffic-free   One way to get started cycling on the road is to follow a national bike route and take a small diversion.  Sustrans , the cycling charity, has loads of great family rides that are either entirely traffic-free, or mostly. But if you want to give little ones a quiet road to practice on then you can always find one along the way.  Because these routes are also shared with pedestrians this gives you a chance to educate your little ones on being considerate and safe. Explain that they should stay on one side, not zig-zag across the whole path. Treat these paths like a road and make it into a fun game that helps your kids learn.  3. Pick the right bike   Hybrid bikes take elements from road bikes and mountain bikes, so they are a great choice if you are looking for something that\u0027s great on the roads but also suitable for some slightly rougher terrain.  A good option for younger cyclists is the Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike (above), \u0026pound120 (save \u0026pound10) which offers 18 gears with twist shifters for easy gear changes. Plus you get \u0026pound15 worth of free accessories when you buy a junior bike at Halfords right now.    Of course, it\u0027s equally important to invest in a good bike for yourself. The Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike (above) is \u0026pound300 and ideal for mums and dads looking to head out on their own on an equally good set of wheels. Thanks to its lightweight frame and 24 gears, you’ll be able to tackle hills no problem, without fear that your kids will show you up!  With frames ranging from 14 to 22 inches, it\u0027s perfect for adults and teenagers alike. Disc brakes mean great stopping performance too.   If you are looking to upgrade your current bike then the Boardman MTX 8.6 Hybrid Bike (above) is is great and priced at \u0026pound500. It has you covered from road to trails with it\u0027s versatile design. The aluminium frame is light to save weight, paired with the Suntour NEX forks that are designed to give you complete control over mountainous terrain while off-roading.  Better still, Halfords are currently offering \u0026pound75 of free accessories and clothing when you buy any 8 Series Boardman Bike.  4. Keep the kids in tow            The other step you could take to get younger kids used to on-road cycling is to use a trail gator. Essentially a tow bar that connects a small bike to yours via a rigid metal bar. These mean that your children can be towed on the road by you, getting them used to the traffic in a safe manner.   They can pedal along and the Trail Gator (above) which is now \u0026pound40.04 (save \u0026pound29.95) keeps their front wheel above the road, meaning they can\u0027t cause problems by steering (but can still move the handlebars like mum or dad).   5. Use a good roadside bike route         Once your little one starts gaining confidence, head to a good local cycle lane that\u0027s close to a road. This is a good way of introducing your youngsters to the noise of the road and the movement of the cars. It also keeps them somewhat separate from other road users.  Routes like Manchester\u0027s Medlock Valley have a selection of different paths and road routes that might help to ease new riders into being confident on the road. Check Sustrans for local rides to you.  Once your kids are able to cycle in a straight line (roughly at least) and avoid obstacles without panicking then they\u0027ll feel a lot more confident about hopping on the roads.  The Carrera Subway Junior Hybrid Bike (above) priced \u0026pound208 (save \u0026pound52) will help your child get out and about in no time at all. It has a lightweight junior fit aluminium hybrid frame for a light and easy ride, complete with 21 speed Shimano Revoshift gears for slick shifting.   6. Helmets are a must         A well fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes. Feel free to let your kids pick a helmet that suits their personality. That way there will be no arguments when it comes to popping it on.  Halfords stock a range of fun helmets starting at \u0026pound10. Designs like the Paw Patrol Kids Bike Helmet (\u0026pound20), Disney Princess Helmet (\u0026pound20) and stylish Blogger Junior Bike Helmet (above) priced \u0026pound17 are among the most popular.  This colourful helmet has a comfy fit thanks to its removable pads and clever dial-fit adjustment system, and is topped off with plenty of vents to keep heads cool.  Adults will want to stay cool with the ventilated Boardman LC 8.6 Helmet , \u0026pound28, save \u0026pound12. The visor keeps weather out of your eyes and its nice and light for long ride comfort.  If you\u0027re not sure where to start, pop into your local Halfords and our friendly experts will help find the right helmet for you and your family.  7. Riding on the pavement - what the law says    It\u0027s technically illegal to ride a bike on the pavement. However, the advice given to police is to be sensitive to circumstances.  While they can theoretically stop young children (aged under 10) who are cycling on pavements, they have no powers to arrest, fine or even caution them. This is sensible, as young children should not be expected to cycle on the road. (source: cyclinguk.org )  Police are allowed to use their discretion - so adults, too, can get a pass for pavement cycling if there\u0027s a reason for example, cycling with your kids.  If you\u0027re on the lookout for your child\u0027s first bike, right now the Carrera Cosmos Kids Bike (below) is priced at\u0026pound128 (save \u0026pound32).   Ideal for kids who are confident enough to ride without stabilisers, the Carrera Cosmos Kids Bike has an aluminium frame, making it easy to manoeuvre, as well as genuine Kenda tyres and alloy V-brakes.

The pensioner, who suffers from mobility issues, says her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. Retired care assistant Freda said: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?  Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says the travel operator Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish.   17 holidaymakers on Zante seriously ill from being served bootleg alcohol mixed with car anti-freeze  My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after.

To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.

Newlyweds Roxy and Tom Walley - plus nine friends and family members - were getting ready to fly to Italy ahead of their big day in Slovenia when budget airline Ryanair dropped the flight.   Stoke on Trent Live reports that each couple in the party had to fork out around \u0026pound2,500 on alternative flights and transfers to get them to the venue in time for the wedding.  Now they say Ryanair - which claims the flight had to be cancelled due to bad weather - ruined the build-up to the happiest day of their lives.  Roxy, aged 28, said: I couldn\u0027t stop crying, I was distraught. I really didn\u0027t think we were going to make it. It put a dampener on everything. Roxy and Tom, who live in Blurton and spent two years planning their big day, chose Slovenia because of its connections to Roxy\u0027s family. They booked Ryanair flights from Stansted to Trieste in Italy - the nearest airport to their venue - a year ago and were due to fly on July 31, ahead of the wedding on August 4. Roxy said: I booked the flights as soon as they came out - they cost around \u0026pound450 return per couple. They were the only airline flying directly to Trieste. With the flight being from Stansted we went down the day before and stayed in a hotel. On the morning of the flight I just had a text to say it had been cancelled. There was no explanation. I tried ringing Ryanair but couldn\u0027t get through. We looked online but there were no other flights showing up to any surrounding airports.  When I eventually spoke to Ryanair they had no sympathy or understanding that it was our wedding. They didn\u0027t have any other flights until the Friday night which was just too late. The couple eventually found a flight from Heathrow to Croatia, via Dublin, that same day that five of their party could travel on. Administrator Roxy said: It was \u0026pound800 per person and we made the decision to take it. We had to get a taxi from Stansted to Heathrow, we missed our pre-booked transfer in Trieste and we had to get another transfer from Croatia to our venue, which was about an hour-and-a-half drive. The others in the group had to fly on the same flight the following day, so paid for another night in a hotel. The rest of our guests were flying out on the Thursday with Ryanair, so when we did arrive I was worrying the whole time that their flight would be cancelled too.  All the couple\u0027s guests did make it to Slovenia, and the wedding day passed without a hitch. Roxy and Tom returned to the UK on their pre-booked Ryanair flight, and the airline says it has refunded their outgoing fares. The couple have now lodged an application for compensation with Ryanair for the additional costs everyone incurred. Roxy said: They said the flight was cancelled because of thunderstorms but - although I heard it raining in the night - it was a glorious morning, and no other airline cancelled flights from Stansted that day. If it had been a normal holiday we would have just left it and not gone, but it was our wedding. I just feel really sad about it all. Although our wedding day was perfect the run-up was ruined, and we feel guilty about the extra money the others had to spend.

An influx of Eastern European immigrants from Roma communities who have fled persecution in their native countries are now living in streets around Toxteth, Liverpool.  But their arrival has led to a clash of cultures in the working-class, traditionally ethnically-diverse area, with authorities admitting there are tensions with other residents, the Liverpool Echo reports .  Organisations who work with the Roma community say they are being discriminated against over access to jobs and health, while there are claims private landlords are sub-letting their homes.   Residents claim they can\u0027t sleep because of noisy groups on the street late at night, there have been a number of petty thefts and rubbish is being dumped on the pavements.  They say children as young as THREE are being left to roam the streets alone. One man, Cristian Dutu, said his dog was left dead in the street when he and his mother were attacked by a drunken mob. Mr Dutu, a 27-year-old warehouse worker, said he and mother Mihaela Filip asked the group to stop damaging cars parked near their home overnight on April 21.  But a group of men then climbed onto a wall to attack the pair, leaving them with slash wounds.  During the violence, their bulldog-cross Hindo was picked up by his neck and hurled from their balcony after it tried to get between the family and their attackers.  Six arrests were made that evening and three men remain under investigation.  The incident has left Mr Dutu, originally from Romania, feeling deeply unsettled in the home he has built in the city. Mr Dutu described incidents of anti-social behaviour, vandalism and fly-tipping taking place on almost a daily basis. He said: “Every day something is happening. When I moved onto this street almost seven years ago, I liked it. There was a beautiful community all congregating with each other and living in peace. There were students, people seemed to be happy.” But Mr Dutu said he has seen tensions rise and his neighbours move out since immigration from poorer areas of the European Union rapidly changed the demographics of the area.  He said: “Next-door neighbours have been forced to move away through intimidation with the anti-social behaviour and stuff. House burglaries became an everyday thing. Most people moved away but I feel sorry for the ones that own their house here and can\u0027t sell.” Mr Dutu has called on the authorities to install CCTV and “listen” to the residents who make complaints. As problems in the area continue, people happy in their homes for years are moving out, while others who remain say they experience stressful situations on a daily basis.  Kirk Jones, 43, described Wendell Street as “the fifth circle of hell” and fears his “life is in danger” after a violent incident for which he is also under investigation by police. The professional artist and sculptor found himself in police custody after, in his own words, “snapping” and getting involved in a brawl with a group of men on the morning of July 25. The incident saw Mr Jones arrested on suspicion of affray and racially aggravated assault while two other men were arrested on suspicion of affray. Released under investigation and awaiting a charging decision, Mr Jones told the Echo he is “not proud” of his behaviour but believes he was driven to violence by his living situation.  Mr Jones said on July 25 tensions boiled over when he awoke to loud music coming from a house on the street which he says was a single song playing on repeat over and over again. He opened the door and shouted an obscenity, calling for the occupants to turn down the music, but said no-one appeared to be around and he left to go to a nearby shop. Mr Jones told the Echo as he returned home he was attacked by a group of men and women who punched him and hit him with a pipe until a neighbour intervened. He claimed he fought back to defend himself, before making his way back to his house. However, the artist said the group returned to his house and began banging on the door. Mr Jones said: “I thought I am not going to be intimidated, so like Steven Gerrard said I thought \u0027we go again\u0027.  “I opened the door and said \u0027what do you want?\u0027 and luckily then the police arrived. I have thought about it and I wonder what they came back to do, I feel like my life is in danger.” One resident in nearby Holmes Street, who did not wish to be named, said his neighbours on either side had moved out – with one telling how their letter-box and doorbell being stolen from the front of their house. He said: “One of my neighbours said her son was struggling at school because he could not get to sleep at night. “It\u0027s frustrating. We have met with the councillors and the police but I get the feeling they don\u0027t believe it is that bad.  “A lot of anger is towards the landlords. People believe the houses are being sub-let. The resident, who has owned his home for 14 years and lived there for seven, said he has seen a massive deterioration in the past three or four years.  Merseyside Police told the Echo: We are aware of specific tensions within this area and we work with a lot of agencies to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour including Liverpool Community Safety Team, Landlord Licensing, Environmental Health, education and street services.  Through the summer months of May, June and July, we provided a full partnership week, liaising with all residents, and provided a mobile police station in the area for a different day, for seven weeks.

Thomas Markle Senior, 74, claimed Meghan told him he could not make a speech at her wedding to Prince Harry as there would be “no room” for him at the Windsor Castle extravaganza. Last night her brother Tom Jnr, 51, told the Mirror he feared she has changed since becoming part of the royal family. He said: “Throughout our lives, dad always put Meg first, above me and my sister, but if what he is saying is true it appears she is abusing his love for her.  “It’s selfish, cruel even. He gave her everything and now she is giving him nothing but hurt back. Mr Markle said he was devastated at not even receiving a formal invitation to his daughter’s wedding. He said: “Like any father, I wanted to say a few words. I was going to recount the funny story about how she broke the news to me about dating Harry: ‘Daddy, I’ve met a man… Daddy, he’s English… Daddy, he’s a prince.’ “I thought it was a cute story. I was going to thank the royal family for welcoming my beautiful daughter into their family. “But it was a speech that I was never going to be allowed to give. That hurt.” His son Tom Jnr said: “They say blood is thicker than water, but perhaps the blue blood of the royals now runs through Meg’s veins. “It’s heartbreaking to see how this has changed her and the devastation it has caused to my family. “Anyone who saw Meg when she was growing up knew her and my dad were inseparable. Now it looks as though they may never speak again.” Mr Markle claims his three-month rift with Meghan, 37, began when she told him to stop speaking to his eldest daughter, Samantha, who had publicly criticised her.  He said: “Meghan asked me to tell Samantha to stop talking about her and then asked me to stop talking to Samantha. “I have two daughters. I can’t stop talking to one of them. “No father should be asked to turn his back on their children. I love Meghan but I also love Samantha.” Samantha, 53, last night launched a withering attack on her half-sister for seemingly turning her back on their father. She said: “There would be no just reason for her not to want him in her life, as he was good enough to use to make her everything she is. “She should be grateful. Her diplomacy skills suck and are inhumane. “If you treat your own father like this, Harry is next.” She added: “Freezing people out is the best way of hiding the truth.” Outspoken Samantha, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, ensured her comments were received by courtiers after tweeting her thoughts directly to Kensington Palace. She added: “There is no room for a greedy arrogant, deceitful fake humanitarian on this world stage. How dare she? Disgusting.” Mr Markle’s feud with her deepened, some now say irreparably, when he slammed the phone down on Prince Harry after he was found to have lied to the royal about faking paparazzi pictures before the wedding. The award-winning lighting director said he suffered a heart attack just days before the May 19 wedding after he was exposed the photos for cash.  Though he had never met the Prince, the pair had enjoyed a series of “warm and chatty’” conversations after Meghan told him of her relationship with the royal. During the talks, they discussed how best to handle news of their romance when it became public. The Prince stressed that he should avoid the paparazzi at all costs. “Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears,” Mr Markle explained. “He said, ‘They will eat you alive.’ He was right.” But Mr Markle ignored his advice and, on the advice of Samantha, entered into a deal with a British photographer. Together they faked four sets of pictures of him reading a book on Britain, working out on an exercise bike, being measured for a suit and surfing the internet looking at pictures of his daughter. The sets are said to have earned \u0026pound100,000, with Mr Markle taking a small cut. A fifth set, of the pensioner at the home of his ex, Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland, was scuppered when other photographers happened to be at the property when he delivered flowers to her. Following the publication of the pictures Harry, 33, had grown suspicious and challenged Mr Markle over their authenticity. Mr Markle reassured Harry they were genuine pictures and he had not colluded with the paparazzi. It led to a statement being made by Kensington Palace through the press watchdog asking for the pensioner’s privacy to be respected. But less than 48 hours later, Mr Markle was exposed when CCTV footage of him setting up the pictures with a British paparazzi emerged. Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from the heart attack. Harry told him: “If you had listened to me this would never have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man monster cyst back finally","story":"NewsMan has monster cyst on his back finally popped after 25 YEARS untouched in grim footageDave Andrew asked his daughter Kerry to burst the monster spot with a scalpel at their home in BristolShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNadeem Badshah11:52, 12 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the stomach-churning moment a 25-year-old cyst on a man\u0027s back is finally popped.

And while it appears we might not be seeing a blossoming baby bump on Meghan anytime soon, the duchess has definitely been thinking about having children for a while.  In an interview in 2015, the former actress revealed she already has a special gift which she plans to give to her future daughter one day.  And the item has a very significant meaning for Meghan .   While many people\u0027s jewellery collection contains a priceless piece that has been passed down through the generations, Meghan\u0027s meaningful present is not something that has been in her family for years.  Instead it\u0027s something she treated herself to after her hit television show, Suits , was picked up for a third season.   Speaking to HELLO! Magazine three years ago, Meghan revealed: I’ve always coveted the Cartier French Tank watch.  When I found out Suits had been picked up for our third season - which at the time felt like such a milestone - I totally splurged and bought the two-tone version.  She even had the watch, which currently retails for around \u0026pound4,800, engraved with a special message, reading \u0027To MM from MM\u0027. The item, which is a symbol of Meghan\u0027s career success, will be passed along to her future children. She explained: I plan to give it to my daughter one day. That’s what makes piece special - the connection you have to them. During the interview, Meghan also admitted that much of the jewellery she wore during her time as Rachel Zane on Suits belonged to her family.

Age UK has decided to offer guidance as more and more people over 60 undergo transition. Britain’s biggest charity for elderly people usually helps pensioners fight loneliness or to claim the winter fuel allowance. But now they have just released a report aimed at assisting older people who are looking to change sex and adjust to their new way of life. It gives advice on financial implications, employment rights and other types of discrimination, including hate crime. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “For a significant but unknown number of older people in our society the revolution we are seeing in public attitudes is immensely meaningful and they deserve our full support and respect.  “Many will have felt the need to conceal or suppress this crucial part of their identity all their lives, for fear of discrimination, ridicule or abuse, so this cultural change is both wonderful and long overdue. “It potentially offers these older people the opportunity to be truly themselves at last. “The last thing they need now is to be subject to ageism. “They are entitled to exactly the same access to advice, information, support and NHS treatment as everyone else to help them make the best decisions for themselves about their identities and about whether they wish to seek gender reassignment and indeed go ahead with it. “Age must not be a barrier in any of these respects.” The report explains some of the advantages of changing sex in later life: “It can be an opportunity to resolve longstanding conflicts and uncertainties that threaten mental health and wellbeing. “There may be fewer social and economic impacts when work or social responsibilities change in retirement.” Labour MP Luke Pollard welcomed the advice. He told the Mirror: “This is a great idea by Age UK to provide such a report. “It doesn’t matter what age you are if you want to change gender. “This report gives sensible advice to older people wanting to make the change. “I welcome any information that is made available to help people make such an important decision.” NHS Digital has revealed the number of people aged 60 and over who have undergone gender reassignment surgery is rising, although the numbers remain small. The debate around gender dysphoria, a condition in which a person feels distress because of a mismatch between their identity and their biological sex, has focused until now on children who want to change sex before or during puberty.  However the Age UK report highlights the dilemmas facing older people, such as having to tell a lifelong partner you believe you have been living in the wrong body. It also gives advice to the partners of those who are transitioning and warns: “Watching what is happening to your loved one as they come to terms with their gender issues can be challenging, whether or not they decide to pursue transition.” Many trans people and their partners remain in settled, happy relationships, the guidance adds, “but you may feel a sense of loss, confusion, anger or hurt. It can affect your sense of who you are. For example if you were a loving wife to a man, do you become the lesbian partner of a woman?” The guidance and report were launched to coincide with a consultation on changes to the Gender Recognition Act to make it easier for people to change gender. According to NHS Digital, eight people aged 60 and over had gender reassignment surgery in 2008-9, which increased to 11 in 2015-16, the last year that figures broken down by age are available. The figures show that in the seven years to 2015-16 a total of 75 people aged between 61 and 71 had the operation and seven people aged 71 and over. Ruth Rose had a sex change at 81 Ruth Rose, 85, is a former RAF navigator. She has known since she was nine years old that she wanted to be a woman and had a sex change operation when she was 81. At the time in an interview with our sister paper the Sunday People she said: “I’m enjoying the fact that I have made the transition. “My main thing in life isn’t going around saying I am a lady now. “But not a day had gone by since I was nine when I didn’t think I was in the wrong body. I always felt I was a woman.” She took a psychiatric assessment to test her suitability to be the oldest British male to undergo gender reassignment surgery. She did not have to wait long for a decision. She said: “After five minutes, they said we have a 40-minute interview, but you’re through in five minutes. What are we going to talk about?’ It was just a doddle for me. Rose has known since she was a nine-year-old boy called James that she wanted to be female. When she finally had the surgery she achieved “total acceptance” as female. “My friends don’t think of me as ever having been male.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ordinary looking pub incredible attraction","story":"NewsOrdinary-looking pub has incredible attraction in the beer gardenLandlord Paul Greig went to incredible lengths to get the retired plane - a 1966 Jet Provost T Mark Three - set up in his beer gardenShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByPaul Byrne16:57, 12 AUG 2018Updated17:02, 12 AUG 2018NewsPaul Greig proudly poses with his plane (Image: SWNS - LEEDS SWNS)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pub landlord is pulling in the punters after landing a 30ft vintage jet for his beer garden.

Cuts in smoking cessation services have been blamed for the rise, which puts more women at risk of miscarriage and endangering their baby’s health. NHS Digital data shows 10.8% of women were smokers at the time of delivery in 2017/18, up from 10.7% the year before. It marked a halt in progress that had seen rates fall from 15.8% a decade earlier towards a target of 6%.  There is a bigger problem in the North, with 16.1% of mums-to-be smoking in Lancashire and 15.8% in the North East, but just 5% in London.

Sharon Hodgson, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Public Health, said: “The Government must prioritise public health and make sure high quality, well resourced local services are available.”  Hazel Cheeseman, of the ASH charity, said: “The failure to support mums-to-be to quit puts babies’ lives at risk.” The British Lung Foundation said the number of quitting aids prescribed in England had fallen 75% since 2005. Spokeswoman Alison Cook said: “The Government must act urgently.”  Public Health Minister Steve Brine said the Tories were “determined” to cut rates of smoking in pregnancy to 6% by 2022.

Joanne Thomas, who handled cases in North East Lincolnshire, made a number of public posts on social media, including damning comments about casework and sensitive information about families.  Ranting about one of her cases on Facebook, Thomas called one mum a moronic cow and suggested she shouldn\u0027t be allowed near kids, Grimsby Live reports.  In other posts, she complained about dealing with nightmare parents and demonic children as part of her job and described a manager as a f***tard. Families raised concerns that she had been openly discussing the work that she had done with them. Thomas, known as Jo, had been employed through an agency by North East Lincolnshire Council\u0027s children\u0027s services. She has now been removed from her post with the council.  The council said the comments were upsetting for families and had acted swiftly after concerns were raised. It has asked the agency that employed Thomas to investigate the issue. Thomas regularly posted about her work, prompting responses from her online Facebook friends. In one she said: Today was not great, back to back meetings, nightmare parents, demonic children and sh***y drivers. Another post was highly critical of a large family saying: A busy day trying to work out the family dynamics of a family with xx children, not all the same parents but hell I was confused but the amount of different names and relationships of adults involved.  The social worker also had a common habit of referring to the families that she was dealing with as drunks and druggies and regularly called her bosses and the families f***tards.  There were also posts where she identified the location of the families that she had been dealing with, as she discussed how her bosses forced her to return a child to their parents that she deemed to not want her, calling the parents awful and even slating the child, calling her gobby. In one post made Thomas was challenged by one woman who said: Inviting the public to comment on families\u0027 private concerns must break rules on professional conduct. Joanne replied: No it does not. I did not name anyone, I did not mention area and who said it was about work! Stop stalking me.  In another post Joanne, who was involved in family work and court cases, said: Today I hated my job! I had to return a *-year-old and a *-year-old to their mother, an alcoholic, who took an overdose in front of them. The * year-old was so distraught at having to go back she soiled and then wet herself, she wrung her hands and sobbed. I hope those that made the crappy decision have the same nightmares I will now have. The children\u0027s ages have been disguised to help protect the family\u0027s privacy.   One person who had Joanne as their social worker contacted Grimsby Live to express their anger that she had been openly commenting about their casework in social media.  They said: I was shocked to find that this woman had been openly talking about the cases that she is handling involving my family. While we were not mentioned in some of her most critical posts, it was easy to tell who she was talking about based on the times of the posts and the fact that she says \u0027today this happened\u0027. A social worker can have so much power over issues that affect families right to their core and for a social worker to talk so critically and biased about families is just wrong. The posts are thought to have breached rules on professional conduct for social workers. When North East Lincolnshire Council discovered the posts, she was immediately removed from working with them.

At this point I didn\u0027t know what I had done and I was confused. I asked him what I did wrong and couldn\u0027t answer he just said \u0027can you leave the shop\u0027. It\u0027s not as if I went in and jumped all over the food. I wanted an ice cream and was going right back out. Matthew claims the security guard got uncomfortably close to his face which meant he had to \u0027gently\u0027 push him to the side. However, there was at least one other topless shopper in the store at the time, who had muscles and looked fit.

Little Heidi, three, woke up screaming: \u0027 fox ! fox!\u0027 as the savage animal mauled her only an hour after she had been put to bed.  Her dad, George Cooper, was with Heidi\u0027s mum and their four-month-old baby downstairs watching television when they heard Heidi call out from her upstairs bedroom. George, 37, said: “Heidi occasionally wakes up in the night but as I got closer to the top of the stairs I heard the panic in her voice. “I turned on the light and saw it jump down. She was screaming ‘fox’. I grabbed her and shut her in the other bedroom.  “I stamped my foot and the fox left the house by going down the stairs and out the back door.” The frantic parents realised Heidi was bleeding and had suffered bites to her hand and nasty scratches on her arms. Thankfully her injuries are not more serious. They had left the back door open due to the heat when the attack happened last Tuesday in Pett\u0027s Wood, Orpington. George said the evening had started uneventfully, saying: “I had lain there for half an hour and read her a story. I took my four-month-old baby downstairs and then their mum came home from work.” The trio were in their lounge in Petts Wood, south east London, watching a film when screams echoed from upstairs a short time later.

A yellow alert for thunderstorms has been issued for the East Midlands, the East of England, North East England and Yorkshire.  This will be from 11am today until 10pm and there is a chance that homes and businesses could be flooded. Meanwhile there is also a possibility that power cuts could occur so other services to some homes and businesses could be lost. Torrential rain is possible and as much as 20 to 30mm of rain could fall in an hour, or 40mm in two to three hours. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures.  Lightning, hail and gusty winds may also result in some disruption. Luke Miall, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: We\u0027ve got some unsettled weather continuing for the next few days. Quite a contrast really to what much of this summer has seen across the UK. Mr Miall added: This is a thunderstorm warning so we are likely to see some pretty intense downpours developing as the skies brighten up really this afternoon. With that we\u0027ll see some heavy rain which could give the risk of some flash flooding, as well as the risk of spray on the roads.  There will be some tricky driving conditions considering a lot of people may well be out and about given it\u0027s the weekend in the height of the school holidays as well.   But despite the deluge, temperatures have still remained a muggy 20c. And although the unsettled weather is expected to continue with heavy rain on Wednesday, there is still hope for more sun this summer. The weather is expected to bounce back with a 12-day sizzle from Friday nudging 30C (86F) up to the Bank Holiday weekend. Forecaster said drier conditions and highs up to 27C are due Tuesday and Wednesday in the South. The Met Office said Thursday sees rain - but hotter and drier conditions are due from Friday in the South and from Sunday in the North, with heat lasting through the following week for the August Bank Holiday weekend on August 25-27. Highs verging on 30C are due. The South will be warmest and driest. The North will be less settled, but also have warm and dry spells.  Weather Forecast from Monday, August 13  Today (Monday) : Scotland will be rather cloudy with outbreaks of rain, although most of these will be light and patchy. There will also be showers across the eastern and northern half of England throughout the day, some of which could be heavy with a rumble of thunder. Wales and south-western England will have the driest and sunniest day, although a few light showers may develop here too during the afternoon.   Tonight (Monday night) : It is going to be a mixed night, with light rain and cloud across the north of the UK. More widespread rain will tend to move into north-western Britain from the west tonight. The rest of the UK will be mostly dry with rather cloudy skies in northern England, but good clear periods developing further south across England and Wales. There will be light to moderate westerly winds.   UK Outlook (Tuesday and Wednesday) : It will be cloudy, windy and wet for western Scotland and Northern Ireland tomorrow. Eastern Scotland should be drier and brighter, and will also feel rather humid. England and Wales will generally be dry and warm with sunny spells, although a few light showers are possible along western coasts. Wednesday will see a band of rain, perhaps heavy and persistent in hilly areas, slide south-east across Ireland and the north of the UK. The south will be mostly dry and warm with some sunny spells once again. Moderate to fresh south-westerly winds.

Charging more when trains fail to turn up, or are late, crowded and dirty doesn’t add up for \u0026shylong-suffering passengers, who on many routes deserve to pay less. Linking fares to the Retail Prices Index is also unfair when most of what the Government pays out is tied to the lower Consumer Prices Index. If the RPI is 3.5% then most travellers would suffer a drop in living standards as earnings are not going up at that rate.  Public support for Labour’s rail renationalisation plan will only strengthen when the Tories and private firms are taking millions of us for an unaffordable ride. Rail should be a public service, not a heavily subsidised source of profits for transport companies, including those owned by foreign governments. Instead of increasing prices, let’s freeze fares and then return this fragmented industry to public ownership and order. Quit’s a must Smoking during pregnancy jeopardises the health and lives of babies as well as mothers, so the increase – blamed on Tory austerity – must set alarm bells ringing. Cutting help-to-quit services is both dangerous and short-sighted when the human and financial cost of tobacco-related illnesses to the NHS are considerable.

So urgent was Kate Stallard’s case that she didn’t even have time to freeze her eggs before she began treatment that would leave her infertile – meaning she gave up her chance of motherhood. The 32-year-old, from Worcestershire, had split from her partner of 10 years just eight months before she was rushed to hospital in the middle of the night. She had been suffering from headaches and exhaustion, which she put down to divorce stress as she tried to adjust to her new life as a singleton. It was a really stressful time, and very difficult to try and survive it all, Kate said. In the hope of lifting her spirits, Kate started going to the gym more often and began working out with weights after the divorce in 2016. She also took comfort from the idea that time was on her side and, one day, she might have children.  “One of the things that helped get me through my divorce was that I’m still young, so there was time to meet someone else and start a family, she added.  But despite her best efforts, she still felt constantly exhausted, even having to pause multiple times for a rest when taking her dogs for a short walk.  After putting it down to the emotional toll of the divorce, Kate suddenly deteriorated and she collapsed in her bathroom in the middle of the night. From a 1am doctors appointment, she went to the Worcestershire Royal Hospital, where tests revealed that she had acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), a rare type of blood cancer. She said: “I’d been panicking, realising something was very wrong, but I still never thought it could be cancer. Being diagnosed was absolutely terrifying. My world fell apart. “After the night I went to hospital, I didn’t leave for six weeks. Doctors told me if I hadn’t started treatment right away, I would have only had a couple of days left to live.”  In September 2016, just days before her diagnosis, Kate started her period, which was unusually heavy. “It just wouldn’t stop. It was almost like a haemorrhage,” she added. Beginning to panic – particularly after noticing more bruises in odd places she’d definitely have remembered knocking, like the backs of her hands – Kate went to see a doctor. “I’d spoken with a relative who’d had aplastic anaemia, a rare bone marrow disease, so I thought it’d be something like that, or perhaps even a virus,” she said. “I assumed I’d go to the doctor and be sent off with some antibiotics.” After being checked over, Kate asked if she could have a blood test, just to be sure. However, as she was classed as a non-urgent case, she was told she’d need to wait a week for an appointment to become available. But she didn’t make it that far, as two days later, she went rapidly downhill. Barely able to walk, she remembers crawling up the stairs to her bathroom, where she collapsed onto the floor. Terrified she’d pass out with nobody to find her, she called 111, and they organised for her to have an emergency appointment in the middle of the night. “I got there about 1am. They took one look at me and knew something was really wrong,” she said. “They examined all my bruises and took more bloods, which they sent off to be urgently tested. “I went home to wait for the results, and around two hours later, my phone rang again with the doctor telling me I was seriously ill, and needed to get to A\u0026ampE fast.” Taken straight into isolation at Worcester Royal Hospital, she was given a blood transfusion whilst they ran further tests, including a bone marrow biopsy.  Then, a few hours later, doctors broke the news that she had leukaemia and sepsis , and had been just days from death.   As she required such urgent care, Kate was unable to go home, told instead to remain in hospital while doctors worked on her to ensure she was strong enough to begin chemotherapy in two days’ time. Heartbreakingly, as she had always wanted children, this did not leave her enough time to freeze her eggs. She explained: “I was told the type of chemotherapy drug I was to have can affect fertility. One of my first questions was, ‘Can I freeze my eggs?’ “But doctors told me that the process takes a few weeks, and I wouldn’t survive it. It was devastating. I held on to the hope that the chemotherapy may not do that much damage, but I have since gone for fertility tests and it wasn’t possible to harvest any eggs. “That’s been one of the hardest parts, and most horrific side effects for me. I know adoption and so on is an option, and that I had to have the treatment to stay alive, but I still need to grieve.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young boy spotted smoking london","story":"NewsYoung boy spotted smoking on London street after being given cigarette by womanThe small child was seen puffing on the fag outside a restaurant called Tex Bites in Leytonstone, east London, in front of stunned onlookersShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNadeem Badshah16:55, 12 AUG 2018Updated07:23, 13 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA small boy was spotted smoking on the street after being given a cigarette by a woman he was with.

Felicity Kadlec claims that she has an intimate relationship with the young female doll called Kelly, which is covered in fake blood and has a mangled face.  The 19-year-old, who has Kelly\u0027s name tattooed on her arm, showers the disturbing figure with kisses and dresses her in pink clothes. The doll was gifted to Felicity when she was just 13 after finding it on a creepy doll collection website - and the pair are now in love, the teen claims.  Felicity, from the US state of Massachusetts, said she plans to \u0027marry\u0027 Kelly next month. The student said: I found Kelly on a creepy doll collection website and I was gifted her when I was 13. But it wasn\u0027t until I was 16-years-old that I started to get feelings for her, but it was something that I kept on trying to deny.  I have had boyfriends in the past, and I always thought that I was in love with them - but they never made me feel the way I do now. Unfortunately a lot of people don\u0027t understand our relationship, but I am so confident that I\u0027m in love with Kelly that I got her name tattooed on my arm. We have a normal, intimate relationship which is progressing in the normal way - and we are getting married in September. Despite having owned Kelly for over six years, Felicity claims it took her three years to discover her true feelings for the doll.  She said: Our relationship was on and off since I was 16, because I would tell myself that it was wrong and break it off. But over the past year I have really come to terms with my feelings for her and I know that my love for her cannot be changed. I got her name tattooed on my arm in the spring because she\u0027s always going to be a part of my heart - she is a part of me and no one can change that. I am intimate with Kelly - I caress her and feel safe with her, and I feel a genuine connection when I\u0027m having an intimate moment with her.

We may hear stories about them from old pals, or uncover a hidden treasure, and these things can make the heartbreak of mourning a little easier. But a group of sisters got a little more than they bargained for when they found some of their late mum\u0027s old letters and decided to read them. They found a bunch of letters their dad had sent her when he was working away in London in the 1960s.  The sisters gathered together to read them, but it turns out they weren\u0027t the romantic love notes they were hoping for.  One of the women shared the story on Twitter under the name Morven, writing: After my Mum died we found letters, tied in a bow from my Dad from when he worked away in London in the 60\u0027s.  My crying sisters and I held hands, opened one and the whole thing was about how much he missed shagging her, apparently a bit of a goer. Didn\u0027t read the rest. Wow, just wow. Her tweet has been liked more than 6,000 times and she\u0027s been inundated with messages from people who loved the story.    When one person suggested she must at least be happy to know there was passion in their relationship, the woman replied: Um, kinda. We already knew they were in love and all that but seeing sexual acts that you Mum has performed on your Dad written down is another kettle of fish. One man shared a similar situation he found himself with his parents. He wrote: My mum\u0027s stuff included a bundle of letters labelled To be destroyed when I pop my clogs. My brother took a lot of persuading that she meant To be destroyed *unread*..., and that we should honour the spirit rather than the letter of the request.

Urban explorer Rosie Boulton, 19, had seen ghostly orbs before, but nothing like what she discovered at an abbey in Wales. Travelling to several haunted locations a week, Rosie is constantly on the road snapping pictures of ruins at night.  Whist photographing Tintern Abbey at night, Rosie and friends didn\u0027t find anything unusual , apart from feeling creeped out whilst at the location.  However, when Rosie returned home and looked at the images, she spotted the \u0027ghostly figure\u0027 her camera had captured. The \u0027hooded figure\u0027 can be seen in the photographs standing in front of the ruins.  Having always believed in ghosts and the paranormal, she couldn\u0027t believe her luck and can\u0027t wait to visit the location again. Rosie, from Stanford Bridge, Worcs, said: I get an adrenaline rush, especially when it\u0027s dark because it sets that eerie vibe. I felt okay at the beginning but it was a huge place which made it feel a little more spooky.  You\u0027re not supposed to go there at night. We felt like someone was coming towards us so we all ran out as we were scared. I didn\u0027t know about the ghost of the monk until I got home and looked back at the pictures. I was on my own going through the photos and it just freaked me out. I called my friends and told her about the photos straight away.

Astonishing footage shows the herd approaching and the elephant taking big gulps and dipping its trunk underwater as the thrilled holidaymakers looked on. The video was captured by Mhondoro Lodge tour guide Ivan Ueckermann after he spied the herd walking up to the hotel in South Africa\u0027s Limpopo province.  Ivan, 29, said: I knew this was a great opportunity to witness them in their natural environment. We learn so much about these amazing creatures and their behaviour, how they react to one another, which ones dominate the pool keeping the others at bay. Just enjoying the sounds they make when they drink the water and communicate, or seeing textures of their skin and super long eyelashes.  It was amazing. During dry season in South Africa, few natural rivers flow and waterholes are dry, forcing to elephants to resort to alternative measures. Ivan said the pool contained salt water with no chemicals, so it was perfectly safe for the elephants to drink.

The country is gripped by the most intense droughts of the last 100 years, and according to meteorologists, it isn\u0027t going to ease up anytime soon. The country\u0027s most populous state - New South Wales - was declared entirely in drought last Wednesday and struggling farmers were given new authority to shoot kangaroos that compete with livestock for the little remaining grass left. This is where Len McLean, 69, from Morundah, found the remains of a kangaroo laying in dry grass in the heart of the Riverina in the state’s southwest, reports Australia\u0027s Daily  .  It’s not uncommon for Len to come across roo remains while out working cattle - but he said it\u0027s rare to find a kangaroo perfectly intact because foxes and feral animals typically scatter the bones across the paddock. He said: “It was still intact - that\u0027s the way I found it and I just put it back together again and stood it up on it\u0027s tail and two feet. It’s pretty dry out here, there’s not much feed and there are dead kangaroos everywhere.

Primary Industries Minister Niall Blair said farmers were enduring one of the driest Southern Hemisphere winters on record. He told the Dawson Creek Mirror : This is tough.

The newlyweds will reportedly be based in a multi-million pound waterfront mansion when they attend the Invictus Games in Sydney. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have rented an eight-bedroom pad which offers breathtaking views of the city\u0027s famous harbour, it was claimed. Photos of a similar mansion in the same exclusive neighbourhood reveal cavernous sitting and dining rooms, and bedrooms that are bigger than most flats in London.   The home where Harry and Meghan will stay looks strikingly similar to Villa Del Mare, a luxe, six-bedroom mansion worth almost \u0026pound23m, the Interiors magazine Inside Out reported.  Both homes are located in affluent Point Piper in Sydney\u0027s eastern suburbs.  The mansion boasts floor-to-ceiling windows, private balconies and an inifinity pool and deck where guests can go for a dip or soak up Australia\u0027s summer sun, the Herald Sun newspaper reports.     There is enough parking space for a fleet of high-end cars outside the stunning residence, which has some of the best views of Sydney Harbour. The estate also has a private butler\u0027s residence. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan declined to comment on the report. Harry, who turns 34 next month, and Meghan, who turned 37 on August 4, are due to visit Australia, Fiji New Zealand and Tonga on their first royal tour following their wedding last May.  They are expected to be in Sydney when the fourth Invictus Games - founded by Harry in 2014 - are held there in October. Specific details of the trip have not yet been announced. Last year, the couple took their relationship public when they appeared together at the Invictus Trials in Toronto, Canada. By heading Down Under, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will follow in the footsteps of Harry\u0027s mum and dad, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, who visited Australia and New Zealand on their first tour as a married couple.

We know so much about their history, their traditions and their public life, but we know very little about what they\u0027re like behind closed doors. So it\u0027s surprising that so many of them use social media, and share private and personal photos with their followers. Several members of the royal gang use Twitter and Instagram to let their fans know what they\u0027re up to, as well as sharing cute family photos and brilliant throw back pics. So let\u0027s have a little social media stalk, shall we?

Amelia, known to pals as Mel, has a huge following on Instagram and shares lots of photos of her exciting life.  Princess Beatrice  Instagram handle: @beayork   Privacy: Closed   Bio: Not known  There was a lot of speculation about whether Princess Beatrice used social media, as she doesn\u0027t have any public accounts.

Typically, he stated: “The day is all about Eddie and Gillie!”In response to my Alan Gilzean memories on July 13, Mike Blair responded: “I well remember Alan Gilzean’s hat-trick against Cologne in that 8-1 victory in the European Cup at Dens Park.“I often went up to Dens Park with my dad.“I also remember Alan Cousin’s collision with the German goalkeeper.“The goalie should have known better than to tangle with that big Latin teacher!”Michael Wilson said: “I reckon the 5-1 win over Rangers at Ibrox in 1961-62 was the result which made the team — and the fans — realise they could win the title.“I was at the game, along with my dad John and brother Peter.”John Sturgeon offered: “I remember Bill Shankly saying that absolutely Gillie murdered Anderlecht in the first leg of the European Cup quarter-final in Belgium.“He had an amazing partnership with Alan Cousin up front and winger Gordon Smith.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether reunion remembers lawside glory days","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Midlands AFA side Lawside FP held a reunion, which also included their inaugural Hall of Fame.Four members were inducted.Posthumously, Eric Murphy, Willie “Pancho” McGregor and Charlie Adam Sr were the first to be given the accolade, along with Jim Fyffe Sr.Attendees included Roger Dewar, Frankie Brown, Peter Anderson, Jim Fyffe Sr, Jake McDonough, Jim Sorrie, Paul Smith, Micky Duthie, Joel Sase, John Kenneth, Geoff Peters, Scott Fyffe, Ian Dunbar, Tom Stewart, Ged Kelly, Jimmy Fyffe, Danny McBride, Alan McGivney, Dave Reilly, Keith Wilson and Kieran Brown.The club won a host of domestic honours, but their greatest claim to fame was actually a defeat.A great Scottish Amateur Cup run in season 1988-89 saw them reach the final, agonisingly going down 3-2 to Norton House at Hampden Park.See reunion photo (above).\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether why did celtic legend jock stein only manage scotland for six months in the 1960s","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlex Madden, of Carnoustie, has asked me to clarify a situation.He said: “I enjoyed your stories about Bobby Brown and his Scotland team which beat England 3-2 at Wembley in 1967.“I was working in London at the time and was at the match. It was an amazing match and an amazing occasion for Scottish fans.”However, it was not that game which prompted Alex to call me but events a year or so prior.He continued: “I’m sure that, just before the appointment of Brown, Scotland couldn’t settle on a permanent manager of the team. I’m sure Jock Stein was briefly in charge at some stage around that time — well before his permanent appointment in the early 1980s.“Can you shed any light on this?”Ian McColl was in charge of the Scotland international team from 1961 to 1965, before Jock Stein took over for six months.It was just a part-time appointment as he had only recently left Hibs to lead Celtic.The SFA waited five months before replacing Stein with Clyde manager John Prentice in April 1966.Meant to be a permanent appointment, Prentice’s tenure would feature only four games — and all at home.The first three saw defeats from England, Holland and Portugal, then, typically, recorded a 1–1 draw with reigning world champions Brazil.He then left and returned to club management with his old club Falkirk.The final appointment before Brown was former Celtic and Kilmarnock player Malcolm Macdonald, who agreed to an interim appointment — a three-week stint between October-November 1966.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba achieves one of our remaining aims by bringing target man to dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have secured the signing of Slovak striker Pavol Šafranko on a season-long loan from Danish Superleague side Aalborg BK.The 6-ft 1-inch, 23-year-old played under Csaba Laszlo at DAC Dunajska Streda before moving to ABK in August 2017.Pavol has played twice for the Slovak national team and scored three goals in eight appearances for the Under 21s, and lists Tatran Prešov and Železiarne Podbrezová as previous clubs.Manager Csaba Laszlo said: \u0026#8220It was one of our remaining aims to acquire a target man, and Pavol fits that role.\u0026#8220I know him from our time together at DAC and believe we are getting a striker who will complement the players already here.

We have asked the question and spoken to the club and I believe there is an agreement there but there is nothing agreed with him yet.”Ayr striker Shankland, who has started the season in scintillating form with nine goals in five games, has been linked with a move to Dundee in recent weeks.It was reported on Thursday that the newly-promoted Championship club had rejected a bid from an English side for their striker, but McCann, who has made it clear he is keen to add to his attacking options, played down his interest.“It’s really unfair to comment on any players I am after,” he said. “What I would say is that I have been in the market and been actively trying to get players.“Some have come close and fallen through, others not.“Lawrence is a very talented player.“I know him from my time at Dunfermline and have no doubt he could come to a club like Dundee and do very well, especially in the Premiership.“But as it stands there is nothing happening.”He added: “We tried to do some business on Thursday, it didn’t quite happen but we will continue working on that.”Dundee \u0026#8216agree deal\u0026#8217 for English attacker\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann delight at deacon return saying he could be massive","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann is delighted to see “a player who could be really massive for us this year” has returned to training.Winger Roarie Deacon is yet to feature for the Dark Blues at all since the final day of last season after picking up an ankle injury in the 1-0 defeat to Partick Thistle.At the time, the injury didn’t seem too serious but eventually required surgery and has kept Deacon out of action for the entirety of pre-season and the beginning of the campaign.Last week, though, he posted photos on social media of his return to training and his boss was delighted to see the former Arsenal kid back in action.Neil said: “I was really delighted to see him back.“I was sick for Deacon because he got himself into great shape last year and he was so looking forward to hitting the ground running in pre- season but then he picked up a really innocuous injury against Partick.“He’s back running and I’m delighted with that because he’s a player that could be really massive for us this year.”Deacon remains a few weeks away from a return.When he does become available once more for selection, Neil admits he’ll have welcome decisions to make between his players.Something central midfielder Lewis Spence has given him thanks to his form of late.“We want to have decisions to make all over the place,” Neil added.“I thought Lewis’ display was brilliant last week. Maybe he just reinforced why I brought him to the club. Last year he was unfortunate with injury but I’m hoping he’s just one of many who tries to force his way into my starting XI.“If I get enough of those guys pushing then I’ve got a good headache to have this season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann on leeds united target steven caulker i thought we would lose him","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann was left relieved after managing to hold on to a couple of key players as the English transfer window shut on Thursday afternoon.Glen Kamara and Steven Caulker were both linked with a move down south \u0026#8211 with Leeds rumoured to be interested in the latter \u0026#8211 but remain with Dundee, and McCann says there were never any offers despite the reported interest.“There have been no official bids put on the table yet for Steven,” he said. “Clearly he is a player that attracts a lot of interest.“The good thing is, I thought he would probably go and we would lose him, but we still have him.“We need to be thankful for the squad we have just now, because we could have lost a few players to down south.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ac1ff5f9a94b.jpg ","title":"dundee land supply exceeds requirement for housing and employment","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee continues to have a “healthy and effective” supply of land for housing and employment.Members of the city council’s planning committee will hear on Monday that there is available land of varying size and in a diversity of locations in the city.In a report to the committee on the performance of the planning service provided by the city council, director of city development Mike Galloway said: “The figures in the national headline indicators demonstrate that Dundee City Council continues to have available a healthy and effective supply of housing and employment land of varying size, in a diversity of locations available within the city.“The housing land supply exceeds the minimum five-year requirement.“Allocating a healthy supply of employment land provides a focus that facilitates the delivery of jobs to support Dundee’s population and wider economy.“Local development plan policies encourage existing and new businesses to invest with confidence in the city.”Mr Galloway added: “The approval rate for planning applications has remained high at 92.7% which reflects the council’s aim to achieve a positive outcome for every application.“We provided a high quality planning service over the year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people mums the word as cerys goes for glory","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 15-year-old local school girl is celebrating a double international call-up.Cerys Cairns, of Perth Academy, has been selected for the Scotland U/15 and U/17 netball squads.She has been picked for the final U/15 squad and is in the U/17 pool which will be pared down later.The U/15 group faces Northern Ireland and 10 top English teams in Loughborough from August 30-September 2.The U/17 will start training in a couple of weeks, with the squad trimmed in January.

star midfielder Glen Kamara ahead of today’s visit of Aberdeen.The Finnish international went over his ankle three weeks ago and missed the Betfred Cup games against Peterhead and Brechin.He was expected to be fit for the Premiership opener at St Mirren last weekend but suffered a reaction to the injury on the eve of the game in Paisley.It’s unclear yet just how long that will keep the central midfielder out for but he is a big doubt for today’s home clash with the Dons.Despite falling to a 2-1 defeat to the Buddies, the Dark Blues midfield didn’t miss Kamara’s presence too much with Lewis Spence an able deputy with Kharl Madianga, Elton Ngwatala and Paul McGowan ahead of him also performing well.And those four are expected to continue today from the start.Meanwhile, the English transfer window shutting yesterday evening was good news for Dundee fans with Kamara and Steven Caulker still at the club.Kamara had been linked with a move to newly- promoted Premier League side Wolves and Championship Swansea.Loan moves are still available to Football League clubs but the Dark Blues would be unlikely to accept a loan-to-buy deal with the 22-year-old’s contract expiring at the end of the season.Both Celtic and Rangers had been credited with interest in the midfielder and they have till the end of the month to make a move if they so wish.Central defender Caulker had been linked with a £1.5 million move to Leeds United this week but that failed to materialise.Turkish side Trabzonspor have also been credited with interest in the England

decisions as he tries to get his team back to winning ways at Queen of the South today.After an opening day league defeat that saw three goals conceded in the second half against Dunfermline last week, his desire to make changes is obvious.However, a number of factors, not least fitness, will come into play before he finalises his line-up.Stewart Murdoch could return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the squad.After almost a month out, though, it may be the best he can hope for is a place on the bench.And the fact today sees United’s first outing of the campaign on a synthetic surface could be a factor in whether or not the pair are involved.Whoever he decides, or is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart Murdoch or Callum Booth or Billy King,” he said.“You should not just be a shadow for these players, you have to deliver, make competition for places.“They want to play in the first XI when they are fit – do you want to just give them your place?”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow man clocked at

in p7 to little ones again in s1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSecondary school isn’t just a step up to “big school” – it’s a rite of passage for kids as they grow into young adults.As they learn to take more responsibility for themselves and manage their own lives, it can be a stressful time.Fortunately, head teachers and council education experts do more than ever to make sure each new intake of pupils is happy, secure and confident in the new environment.Teresa Little, head teacher at St Paul’s RC Academy, said that the move to high school can be just as big a step as starting school in the first place – although for rather different reasons.“Normally, the families are more anxious than the pupils, who are usually all set to go to ‘big school’,” she said.“But it’s a big shift, from a school of maybe 100-400 pupils to one of anywhere from 800-1,200 pupils.“And they’re going from being the ‘big kids’ in P7 to being the little ones again in S1 – there’s a big shift in that dynamic.”Secondary school also primes pupils to take greater responsibility for themselves and their school work.Teresa added: “The whole day is completely different.“The bell goes every 50 minutes, you move classes, you’ve got six different teachers each day – and you’re put into classes with other kids you don’t know.“There’s a greater need to keep an eye on all your stuff and remember the days you have PE or home economics.“You have to build new relationships and take more responsibility for yourself. It really is completely different.”However, to introduce concepts such as lesson periods and practical subjects, pupils from feeder schools start visiting their future high school as early as two years in advance.They are shown around, meet staff and pupils and get a feel for the bigger environment – as often as eight times, depending on each pupil’s needs.Primary schools also meet secondary schools regularly to discuss any particular needs for children.Any and every possible move to help kids settle in is considered, and nothing is too much trouble.Dundee City Council education officer Anne Leary, formerly head teacher at St Andrew’s RC Primary, said that children who are more anxious than others, for whatever reason, can be offered extra support.“What is important to me is that all of these young people have a voice,” she said.“And that’s a voice they can use to share concerns and make suggestions too – it’s not a case of having things done to them.“It’s important that secondary school is spoken about in a positive way – and more often than not kids are ready to make that switch.”Tracey Stewart, also a council education officer, added that as well as being a place for kids to thrive academically, high school serves as a place in which kids can develop emotionally and engage with their own interests.“There are so many activities pupils can get involved in now and they can open up some real opportunities,” she said.“For example, if a child is interested in music we can point them towards orchestras and choirs while they’re still in primary school – they could be playing with them long before they start secondary school.”And while there are new things such as getting the bus to school and having the independence to leave the grounds at lunchtime, Dundee’s educators want kids to thrive and enjoy their time at high school.Teresa said: “We encourage pupils to have a positive attitude to school and to see it as an opportunity – we want it to be the best experience it can be.”The first year of secondary school isn’t just a big change for the pupils making the leap this week – it can mean a big shake-up for their families too.However, Teresa Little, head teacher at St Paul’s RC Academy, said getting parents to engage with schools can sometimes be a challenge.Some parents may be put off by their own experiences of school – or may worry about how, or even if, they can help.This year, St Paul’s is holding open afternoons, when parents can come in and see what their kids have been up to. These will be run three times a year.It’s not the only thing schools in Dundee are doing to stop a parent’s connection with their child’s learning from ending at the front door of the school.Teresa said: “This year we had a parental learning session with Tree of Knowledge (a team of educational speakers working across Scotland) about boosting parental engagement.“We’re also working with some parents, through staff and the senior management team, to ask them if they can support their child’s learning.“Some parents may not have had a good experience at school themselves.“But things have changed and we talk more positively now.“Parents can also be anxious about how they can help – so we work with them on that.“Ultimately, it’s about making a connection, to say to them ‘pick up the phone if you need to’.“It’s important for parents to engage with us and they often do through events such as prize bingo and school shows.“But we’re always looking for ways that we can make it better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"neil mccann says dundee need help of new striker but reveals budget worry","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann fears he may be priced out of finding the striker he needs to sort Dundee\u0026#8217s shot-shy attack.The Dens Park boss is worried his budget might not stretch far enough to bring in the quality frontman he requires after seeing his side lose 1-0 to Aberdeen.For the second week running the Dark Blues had chances to go in front.But like in their opening-day loss at St Mirren, defeat was self-inflicted as Genseric Kusunga\u0026#8217s handball in the box handed Gary Mackay-Steven the chance to tuck home the only goal from the spot with quarter of an hour left.McCann\u0026#8217s men are sitting with nothing to show for their efforts and the Dundee chief knows he needs to bring in new competition for frontmen Sofien Moussa and Jean Mendy after both wasted golden opportunities against the Dons.\u0026#8220We need help in that department, we need someone in for that area,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220There is no update on anyone, it\u0026#8217s difficult in the market with the budget we work on.\u0026#8220The problem is the money down in England, it\u0026#8217s very competitive and we are priced out of so many markets.\u0026#8220You just have to be patient and hope one comes up that fits the budget.\u0026#8221Former Dundee United winger Mackay-Steven took flak as he made his return to Tayside but the 27-year-old had the last laugh as he stroked home the winner late on.\u0026#8220I always seem to get a bit of stick here but I was delighted to get the win,\u0026#8221 he said after Aberdeen grabbed all three points, having missed their own fair share of chances.\u0026#8220I was happy to stroke the penalty away in the end.

The council’s community safety team told us that it patrols at 7pm and that’s it,” said the 53-year-old.“The youngsters like to ride past and kick cars. They’ve ridden over the top of cars as well. They’ve hit my car a few times but it’s usually just small marks.“But there’s a lady who lives next door to me who seems to be more of a target and it’s having a serious effect on her.“I think they target her because she’s disabled and less likely to go after them. She’s resorted to setting up CCTV to try to get them.“She gets very anxious at around 8pm each night, looking out of the window, waiting for it all to start.”Ms Nicoll said that some of those alleged to be carrying out the vandalism were known in the area.She added: “I can almost understand why they’re acting this way – there’s nothing for kids their age to do around here.“And they’re full of hormones – they’re wanting to show off to their pals how manly they are.”Another local resident said his car’s bonnet had been dented.He added: “I’ve tried speaking to the parents of some of the lads – they need to realise the misery they’re causing people.”The issue was discussed at a meeting of Fintry Community Council, when PC Lynsey Jackson said the area would be made a local policing priority.She added: “We will see what we can do – we’ll flood the area as much as we can.”A council spokeswoman said: “The council has responded to residents on a number of occasions about these issues.

Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors.

for the community asset transfer of Woodside Burgh Hall has been received by Aberdeen City Council on behalf of Woodside Congregational Church.The hall, on the city’s Clifton Road, was built in 1834 but has been closed since 2012 after being mothballed by the local authority and faced being sold after it was deemed surplus to requirements.MSP Mark McDonald held a public meeting in September to gauge public interest in saving the hall.While residents in the area expressed interest, concerns were raised over the state of the building and the possibility that it would require significant repairs.However, Woodside Congregational Church may now be in with a chance of taking control of the hall – stopping it being sold off to developers.The church, which will celebrate its 200th anniversary in November, currently meets in a portable unit on Printfield Walk.Minister of Woodside Congregational Church, Reverend Andrew Cowie said: “We currently don’t have a home and we really don’t want to lose the building.“We had representatives from the church at the original public meeting but as soon as we saw large organisations get involved, we backed off.“We then heard that the deadline was August 1 and that there hadn’t been any applications in.” The church’s plan, if given the go-ahead by the council, would involve making the hall wind and watertight within the first six months, then sort out the heating.Rev Cowie added: “The church would obviously use the front area of the hall for an hourly service, but other than that, the space can be hired out to the rest of the community.“We want the building to be fully available to the community but we know we have a long road of negotiation ahead.“I have previously been involved with a community asset transfer and that took two years, so it’s still early days for us to get excited.“The church has almost 200 years behind us and I’d like to think we could have another 200 years ahead.”Mr McDonald said: “It would be great to see the hall being put to good use for the community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"latest section of awpr set to open","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new section of the Aberdeen bypass is set to open

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray golf club hold gents open","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 31/07/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 Gents Open was held on Saturday July 28.Despite the heavy overnight rain the course held up well and was in great condition for the players.The competition was well contested in both the scratch and net categories.The net competition was won by Neil Armour with an impressive 71.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety. The hotel\u0027s current owners, based in Malaysia, have so far failed to act on a Dangerous Building Notice served on the hotel in the Spring.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united reject 150000 bid","story":"NewsAyr United reject £150,000 bid for striker Lawrence ShanklandUnited directors are holding firm in their bid to keep hold of the highly rated striker.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:09, 7 AUG 2018NewsShankland is a man in demand (Image: SNS Group)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have today rejected an offer of \u0026pound150,000 for star striker Lawrence Shankland.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13075347.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_020818flushes_05JPG.jpg","title":"mixed support hgv parking plan","story":"NewsMixed support for HGV parking plan in GirvanA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:20, 13 AUG 2018NewsTown centre car park could be used by HGVs for overnight stops (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think. At least that’s the view of four random people the Post spoke to in the town. But they want rules to ensure there aren’t trucks sitting in The Flushes car park 24/7. Ayrshire Roads Alliance are looking at a plan that would allow HGVs to park overnight. And Councillor Alec Clark supports the idea of trucks coming in from 6pm and leaving before 6am next day. But other voices in the town believe this could cause night-time noise for residents at the Hillcrest car home. And they fear excessive diesel fumes in the heart of the town.  Craig Galloway, 54, said: “Having the lorries going to The Flushes would free up the harbour area for cars and buses. And it would maybe stop them parking in the streets.” Mr Galloway added: “I think the lorries do bring a business benefit to the town, in terms of spending in shops and take-aways.” Nat Taylor, 64, thought: “The Flushes car park tends to empty at night, and the lorries are generally away first thing in the morning.” Mr Taylor added: “There’s really nowhere else that’s suitable. Ainslie car park (at the south end of the town) would only take about four HGVs.” Betty McQuiston, 76, has been involved with Girvan’s volunteer attractions committee for many years. She doesn’t want to see the town’s streets clogged up with heavy trucks. But she admitted: “ It’s a Catch 22 situation. We don’t necessarily want trucks overnight in the town - but they have to go somewhere.  “There’s already quite a lot parking in the streets, so having them at The Flushes would be better.” Mrs McQuiston added: “There’s no room at Ainslie car park, and the trucks have ripped up the surface at the harbour car park.” Scott Purdie, 49, believes a truck park could be created at Grangestone Industrial Estate. He said “It’s a big estate, with big areas of ground that could be used for overnight parking of trucks.” Mr Purdie added: “Big lorries don’t help tourism, but I can see the argument that they need somewhere to go. “However, 6pm is not late in the summer, and people in cars are sometimes frightened to park next to them. “I would fear The Flushes turning into a full-time lorry park, unless it’s properly regulated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours. Please provide as much information as you can about the exact location of the items found to aid the disposal process. “In relation to private ground, the responsibility for disposal lies with the land owner. If you find a needle or syringe on your own property you should always exercise caution and follow advice regarding their safe removal. “Wear heavy duty gloves, use tongs or tweezers to pick up the item and put the item in a suitable container, like a metal tin, a hard plastic tub or empty water bottle, always with a lid.

And this little beauty is the same age as Girvan owner Robert ‘Rab’ Smith. Retired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956. “It’s quite a cute wee thing for its age,” said Rab of the British classic. The cars cost a mere \u0026pound507 when first launched in 1952. That was \u0026pound62 cheaper than main rival, the Morris Minor. Rab, who was also a retained firefighter for 26 years, loves a vintage car.  And he had a 1959 Austin A35, before acquiring the A30. The first owner of the new A30 in 1956 was James McCleary of Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. Mr McCleary ran the car for years before it came into Ayrshire ownership in 1973 with first Frank Webster, then farmer Stanley Gray of Craigmalloch, Barr. Mr Gray also ran it for years, but by 1988 it was in total disrepair - and being used as a chicken coop. It was at this point that Hugh Sloan of Colmonell village came along to rescue the car. Mr Sloan took it to his workshop in Colmonell’s Main Street. And, in a labour of love, he performed a full restoration, including engine replacement and gearbox overhaul,  Hugh replaced the entire interior in 1981, re-chromed various features, and had the car re-sprayed ‘Rover Grey’. Rab said: “Hugh was totally dedicated to his car, and took it round local fetes and galas. “Sadly, he passed away in May this year when I acquired the car. “I hope to keep it in the best of condition for future generations to enjoy.” It is recorded that 223,264 Austin A30s were produced, but the survivors can now be measured in hundreds.

Every assault, every threat is one too many. That is why in 2005 the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act was introduced to make it an aggravated offence to threaten or assault an emergency worker. This does not exclude the use of common law for the very worst of assaults.\n\u0026ldquoThe law is there and I am confident that our police, themselves often at the scene of emergencies, our prosecution service and our courts do not take such assaults or attacks lightly with a range of disposals available.\n\u0026ldquoWhat a politician must never do, as Ms Hamilton has done, is seek to interfere in the process of law.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work. Miss Jane Fergusson executed some remarkable wood carvings in St Andrew\u0026rsquos church and was instrumental in forming a local branch of the Band of Mercy.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-actor-lands-starring-role-in-theatre-royal-programme","story":"ACTORS from across the UK applied in their hundreds for the highly-regarded Theatre Royal education programme.\nAnd following a demanding audition process, one budding thespian from Melrose landed one of the 18 starring roles.\nAlexander Cowan will now embark on a year-long course of mentoring by top industry professionals, which in the past has included Royal Shakespeare Company voice coach Michael Corbridge and Ros Steen, the former head of vocal training at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.\nSome of the acting world\u0026rsquos most famous names have trodden the boards at Newcastle\u0027s Theatre Royal including Dame Judy Dench and Sirs Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart.\nAlexander is delighted to be joining them.

of limited edition Vettriano works.\n\u0026ldquoThis is an extraordinary collection and I hope visitors will enjoy the broad range of works we have on display in the gallery.\nBorn in Fife in 1951, Vettriano began painting at the age of 21.\nFor more than 20 years his paintings have enjoyed worldwide acclaim and he is now regarded as one the most well-loved contemporary painters of our time.\nVettriano\u0027s work is romantic and timeless, with a nostalgic, almost cinematic feel.\nThe Tweeddale Museum \u0026amp Gallery exhibition features Giclee print works - a fine art digital process combining pigment based inks with high quality paper to achieve prints of superior archival quality, light fastness and stability, perfectly suited to Vettriano\u0026rsquos vibrant style.\nThe display, which runs until November 24, is also being featured as part of the Creative Peebles Festival\u0026rsquos Open Galleries Evenings later this month.\nDuring the festival other galleries, studios workshops and retail outlets will open in the evenings to showcase the extraordinary wealth of visual arts and crafts created in and around Peebles.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"syria-brought-into-focus-in-galashiels","story":"THE plight of the people of Syria will be brought into focus later this month in Galashiels.\nArt, photography and

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 104-105)\nHorsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquoAccordingly, as it was then uninhabited [1775], and, from its condition, not likely to become again a family residence, he [an unnamed neighbour who wished to buy the castle] requested permission to improve it according to his taste. This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

the next Bank of England Governor as it prepares the ground for Mark Carney\u0026rsquos successor.\nThe Canadian is due to step down next June after six years in the role and the Press Association understands that Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026rsquos team is now working on the final wording of the job description.\nThe position will be advertised on the Public Appointments website, with the position likely to demand a in-depth understanding of Britain\u0026rsquos economic predicament in light of Brexit.\nThe advert is also expected to feature in a financial publication, having previously run in outlets like The Economist.\nCandidates will be asked to send through a full CV and covering letter when applying for the role.\nThe posting is expected to be up by the end of September, though a firm date has yet to be set.\nFormer Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is among the rumoured candidates to be Mark Carney\u0026rsquos replacement (Philip Toscano/PA)\nA Treasury spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe will begin recruitment for the next Governor of the Bank of England in due course, but did not give further details.\nMr Carney announced in late 2016 that he would stay in his post until the end of June 2019, opting against a full eight-year term.\nIt means he will stay on for three months after Britain formally leaves the European Union in March next year, leaving his successor to navigate the aftermath of the EU divorce.\nThe Governor plays a key role in setting monetary policy and regulation, and serves as chairman of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and Prudential Regulation Committee.\nAmong the rumoured contenders are Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey, as well as Minouche Shafik \u0026ndash a London School of Economics director and former Bank of England deputy governor.\nFormer Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan and Ofcom chief executive Sharon White have also been listed as runners and riders, with the latter having previously served as second permanent secretary at the Treasury and a senior economist at the World Bank.\nDeputy governor Ben Broadbent is still seen as a potential candidate, despite having been forced to apologise earlier this year after controversially describing the UK economy as \u0026ldquomenopausal.\nBrexit is expected to feature prominently in the job description (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\nThe language was deemed sexist and ageist, prompting renewed criticism at the Bank\u0026rsquos lack of diversity among its most senior ranks.\nBut whoever follows in Mr Carney\u0026rsquos footsteps will be scrutinised for how they navigate the post-Brexit landscape and whether the gradual upward move for interest rates will be maintained.\nThe outgoing Governor controversially cut rates to historic lows of 0.25% in August 2016 and launched further monetary stimulus to help stave off an economic slump in the wake of the Brexit vote.\nBut with some signs of economic recovery afoot, the Bank\u0026rsquos interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee earlier this month raised interest rates to 0.75%, their highest level in a decade.\nThe Bank is currently forecasting that the UK economy will grow by 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.\nMr Carney became the Bank\u0026rsquos Governor in 2013, succeeding Mervyn King and becoming the first non-Briton to hold the post.\nHe previously served as Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 and was widely credited with helping the Canadian economy withstand the shock of the financial crisis.\nIt followed a stint in the Canadian government, having been senior associate deputy minister of finance and served both Liberal and Conservative administrations, all of which

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Kirsty, 41, who will be joined by her brother Steven Baron and sister-in-law Lorna, son Kieran and daughter Gemma, as well as other close family and friends, told the Courier she was so scared of heights that she could not even cross the Forth Road Bridge or climb North Berwick Law.  She added: \u0026ldquoEven when he had just months to live, he never wanted a fuss.  \u0026ldquoHe would had not have wanted what we are doing for him.  \u0026ldquoWhat he has gone through for 30 years, it is the least we can do to give back.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.

East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8194742.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"treasury-drawing-up-job-ad-for-new-bank-of-england-boss-as-carney-heads-for-exit","story":"  The Canadian is due to step down next June after six years in the role and the Press Association understands that Chancellor Philip Hammond\u0026rsquos team is now working on the final wording of the job description.  The position will be advertised on the Public Appointments website, with the position likely to demand a in-depth understanding of Britain\u0026rsquos economic predicament in light of Brexit.  The advert is also expected to feature in a financial publication, having previously run in outlets like The Economist.  Candidates will be asked to send through a full CV and covering letter when applying for the role.  The posting is expected to be up by the end of September, though a firm date has yet to be set.  A Treasury spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe will begin recruitment for the next Governor of the Bank of England in due course, but did not give further details.  Mr Carney announced in late 2016 that he would stay in his post until the end of June 2019, opting against a full eight-year term.  It means he will stay on for three months after Britain formally leaves the European Union in March next year, leaving his successor to navigate the aftermath of the EU divorce.  The Governor plays a key role in setting monetary policy and regulation, and serves as chairman of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and Prudential Regulation Committee.  Among the rumoured contenders are Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey, as well as Minouche Shafik \u0026ndash a London School of Economics director and former Bank of England deputy governor.  Former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan and Ofcom chief executive Sharon White have also been listed as runners and riders, with the latter having previously served as second permanent secretary at the Treasury and a senior economist at the World Bank.  Deputy governor Ben Broadbent is still seen as a potential candidate, despite having been forced to apologise earlier this year after controversially describing the UK economy as \u0026ldquomenopausal.  The language was deemed sexist and ageist, prompting renewed criticism at the Bank\u0026rsquos lack of diversity among its most senior ranks.  But whoever follows in Mr Carney\u0026rsquos footsteps will be scrutinised for how they navigate the post-Brexit landscape and whether the gradual upward move for interest rates will be maintained.  The outgoing Governor controversially cut rates to historic lows of 0.25% in August 2016 and launched further monetary stimulus to help stave off an economic slump in the wake of the Brexit vote.  But with some signs of economic recovery afoot, the Bank\u0026rsquos interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee earlier this month raised interest rates to 0.75%, their highest level in a decade.  The Bank is currently forecasting that the UK economy will grow by 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.  Mr Carney became the Bank\u0026rsquos Governor in 2013, succeeding Mervyn King and becoming the first non-Briton to hold the post.  He previously served as Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 and was widely credited with helping the Canadian economy withstand the shock of the financial crisis.  It followed a stint in the Canadian government, having been senior associate deputy minister of finance and served both Liberal and Conservative administrations, all of which came after a\u0026nbsp13-year career with Goldman Sachs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8196692.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"merkel-and-putin-to-hold-talks-on-new-baltic-pipeline","story":"  Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos spokesman Steffen Seibert said the two leaders will meet on Saturday at the German government\u0026rsquos guest house outside Berlin.

Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken thanked the tens of thousands of spectators who have watched events.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoOur supporters have yet again shown themselves to be perfect hosts and I want to thank them for the warm welcome athletes and teams from throughout Europe have received.  Ms Aitken added: \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere in Glasgow during the championships has been tremendous and the welcome that people all over the city have given to athletes and visitors alike has been typically friendly and enthusiastic.  \u0026ldquoAlthough it comes as absolutely no surprise, I couldn\u0026rsquot be more proud of the way the city has embraced our friends and neighbours from across Europe.  The comments come as Team Great Britain had one of its most successful days in the games yesterday, bringing home 10 medals.  Diver Jack Laugher received his second gold of the games for the 3m springboard competition, swimmer Ben Proud came first in the 50m freestyle and teammates Adam Peaty, Nicholas Pyle, James Guy and Duncan Scott worked together to nab the top prize in the men\u0026rsquos 4x100m medley relay.  Jess Learmonth got silver in the women\u0026rsquos triathlon, Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams came second in the synchronised 10m diving while swimmers Max Litchfield and Imogen Clark also gained silver in the 400m individual medley and the 50m breaststroke respectively.

As the athletes continue to shine on the global stage, their success has prompted sportscotland to confirm the first recipients of a \u0026pound500,000 legacy fund aimed at getting communities across the country more active.  More than 90 projects will share around \u0026pound250,000 as part of GO LIVE! GET ACTIVE, a programme designed to support Community Sport Hubs (CSHs) deliver a sporting legacy from the first ever multi-sport European Championships.  The Scottish Government funding, which is being invested by sportscotland, is supporting CSHs that establish new sport or physical activity sessions to target those most inactive in communities. It is also being used to fund projects that use sport and physical activity to improve health, wellbeing and social cohesion.  Minister for sport, Joe FitzPatrick, marked the funding awards by visiting Whitacres Community Sport Hub in Glasgow, which will receive \u0026pound4,590 to deliver a series of new boxing sessions for 16 to 25-year-old women and men over the age of 40.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis \u0026pound500,000 investment will build on the enthusiasm generated by Glasgow 2018, making a lasting difference in communities throughout the country, with a positive impact on the health of individuals while boosting community cohesion.  \u0026ldquoWhitacres Community Sport Hub is a perfect example of this. In particular, I\u0026rsquove been impressed by their boxing programme, which has achieved great success with women and older people.  Meanwhile, the games are also encouraging the city to take interest in an entirely new sport \u0026ndash golf.  As the only new event in the programme at Glasgow 2018, the historic event at Gleneagles is proving popular with fans, and those who can\u0026rsquot make it along in person are gathering in George Square and Glasgow Green to watch the action unfold.  Legendary Open champion Paul Lawrie will visit the championships today, to offer some tips to fans will taking part in a host of fun-filled golfing challenges in the spectator village.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe European Golf Team Championships are a hugely innovative and exciting format, especially as they are providing a historic moment for equality in sport with men and women competing together in the Mixed Team event on Saturday.  \u0026ldquoGolf events provide a terrific day out for the family with something to keep everyone interested. I hope that people will be inspired by watching some great players perform on the course before having the opportunity to try it for themselves in the spectator village.

The cashier accused her of being banned from the store and, when she asked why, she claims she was told: \"Because you\u0027re Scottish\".  It has since emerged another customer with a Scottish accent was escorted from the same store last month after swearing at staff.  But Aileen has demanded a public apology, saying the incident left her \"utterly embarrassed and humiliated\".  She said: \"They abused me because of my nationality, because I\u0027m a Scottish woman.  \"Am I supposed to take the blame for everything a Scottish woman does wrong in a shop?  \"I could not believe what I was hearing.  \"All I was trying to do was buy a couple of bits from my local shop and I was made to feel like a criminal.  \"If I had been banned, do they really think I\u0027d want to go back?\"  Aileen is originally from Greenock, but has lived in Little Plumstead, near Norwich, for 35 years.  The chiropodist briefly visited the Tesco Express in Wroxham, Norfolk, on July 31 when the incident occurred.  But as she tried to pay for the items, she claims she was told she was not allowed back in the supermarket having been previously barred.  \"The young woman serving me looked at me and said I was barred,\" said Aileen.  \"She called another one over and they agreed it was me, saying they could tell due to my Scottish accent.  \"They were just standing there and smirking at me, looking at me as if to say, \u0027we\u0027ve heard it all before\u0027.  \"I asked them why they thought it was me and they seemed to think it was down to my accent.  \"All of the other shoppers were looking over at me, thinking I was lying. It was utterly embarrassing and humiliating.\"  Aileen, a divorced mum-of-two who has six grandchildren, was told she could pay for her shopping on that occasion - but she has vowed never to return to the store again.  She said: \"This has completely destroyed my life. I never want to shop there again.  \"It has affected me so much that I want to give up my shop, it has given me a reason to retire.  \"They offered to give me flowers and chocolates and a meal to say sorry, but I\u0027m not interested.  \"I want a public apology that proves they are generally sorry.\"  Her daughter Ashleigh Smith, 39, said: \"This is a woman who has never done anything wrong in her life and to be treated like that is just awful.  Tesco confirmed the incident was a case of mistaken identity and that Aileen is not banned from the store.

However the areas first ever Performing Classical Ballet Company was formed by Julie Gunn Kavanagh in 2011.  Alba Ballet was created to give students the opportunity to train and perform in full blown Classical Ballet Productions.\u0026nbsp Despite many in the industry saying it would be impossible to do, Julie forged ahead and put together the initial company of 33 talented dancers. Students were aged from 10 through to their early 20s, and came from Greater Glasgow, Ayrshire, Argyll and Inverclyde. Students trained every second Sunday and in 2014 they took the stage at The Beacon Arts Centre with their first ever production, The Nutcracker.    Julie explained that in the Ballet world students spend hours training and doing exams but do not get the opportunity to perform in a Classical Ballet Production. Yes they may do end year performances, but these are maybe 10 min slots rather than an hour and half production. It\u0026rsquos like training two nights a week at football but never taking part in a full game. Alba Ballet is the only Company in Scotland to give these talented dancers an opportunity like this.  The training is over and above normal Ballet classes, and Julie hopes that having the experience of these productions will help enhance the CVs of any Dancers as they look to further their career in the world of Ballet.  Following on from The Nutcracker, Alba produced Cinderella in 2016. Building on the success of The Nutcracker, Alba went on tour and after two performances at The Beacon, they took the production to Barrfields in Largs.    At the moment Alba are putting the final touches to their 2018 production of Coppelia. The cast is again 30 strong and this includes 9 original Alba members from 2014. Luckily they were able to put together a 10 min taster of Coppelia on at The Beacon in June, in front of two packed audiences at Julies Summer Show for her other RAD Ballet School \u0026ndash Elite Academy of Dance  Coppelia is on at The Beacon Arts Centre 2nd and 3rd of November and Barrfields in Largs on the 17th of November.\u0026nbsp It\u0026rsquos a must see for all Classical Ballet followers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Moving forward the company will be recruiting again for their 2020 production, so if anyone is interested in performing in a Classical Ballet- Alba Ballet just might be what you are looking for.  www.albaballet.scot  www.facebook/AlbaBalletCompany/?fref=mentions  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \u0026nbspTonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen  When you think of Italy, it\u0026rsquos easy to imagine the amazing pizza \u0026amp pasta dishes.\u0026nbsp So when customers have described Toninos as \u0026lsquoeven better than the real thing\u0026rsquo it\u0026rsquos because like so few Italian restaurants, Tonino\u0027s Pizzeria and Delicatessen is the real thing.

The figures have led to the country being hailed as the UK\u0027s \"eco champion\", with Angus, North Ayrshire, Edinburgh, the Borders and East Renfrewshire also outperforming other parts of the country.  The upsurge in use of electric vehicles (EV) is a key target of the Scottish Government who have pledged to phase out new petrol and diesel cars by 2032 - eight years ahead of the UK Government.  This has led to investment in charging points north of the border, with almost 1000 now in place across the country.  However, campaigners argue that more work needs to be done to ensure the 2032 target is met.  John Bynorth, of Environment Protection Scotland, said that \u0026ldquorange anxiety, the perception that drivers may run out of charge before completing their journey, is \u0026ldquothe biggest hurdle to overcome.  He added: \u0026ldquoThere have been positive announcements, such as the plans to turn the A9 into an \u0026lsquoElectric Highway\u0026rsquo by introducing more charging points, but there remains a pressing need to ensure the number of places where motorists can plug in and top up their EV charge keeps up with demand.  \u0026ldquoHuge investment is needed, particularly in developing the network of rapid chargers so motorists will be able to stop and charge up for around 20 minutes or less, and then carry on their journeys.  \u0026ldquoRange anxiety can be addressed by local authorities ensuring there are enough rapid plug-in charge points so that motorists will be able to plug in at shopping centres, outside libraries, in car-parks and outside their workplaces.  \u0026ldquoCutting down on planning red-tape and the costs faced by local authorities for installing charging points would also improve the ability of local authorities to roll out charging points between now and 2032.  \u0026ldquoDecisions need to be taken now to ensure there are enough charging points to cope with demand in the coming decades.  The figures, released by car data firm Cazana, show that Argyll and Bute accounted for 4.5 per cent of UK sales - just behind Kent which took the top spot with 4.8 per cent.  This has been linked to the area investing in several new charging points in recent years, particularly in rural areas. For example, the Isle of Mull now has five charging points around the island.  Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThese figures clearly show that strong political commitment and real investment on the ground really do influence the choices people make.  \u0026ldquoWith concern high over the health impact of air pollution from cars and traffic, the largest source of climate change emissions, electric vehicles are clearly a major part of how we need to transform transport in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos commitment to phase out the need for petrol and diesel cars, together with investment which has seen the number of public charging points in Scotland rise, mean there can be no doubt that Scotland is serious about electric cars and the public and companies are responding by buying them in ever increasing numbers, including in a healthy and growing second hand market.  Tom Wood, CEO of Cazana, added: \u0026ldquoOur results show that Scotland is leading the way when it comes to sales of electric and hybrid cars.  \"Our data puts paid to the stereotype that it\u0026rsquos southern English cities that have the monopoly on green technology, and it\u0026rsquos great to see Scottish drivers leading the UK\u0026nbspwith low emission cars."},{"url":null,"title":"tourism-boss-glasgows-streets-could-host-cross-country-skiing","story":"  Paul Bush, director of events at Visit Scotland, claimed it is now \"really easy\" to make snow and the city\u0027s streets could be covered in the white stuff for the event.

The Leif Erikson International Foundation said its \u0026ldquofinal project of donating a 2ft high bust to the Uig community which \u0026ldquowill complete the list of locations where the Sagas say Leif visited or lived.  According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Leif visited the Hebrides in the year 1000 while en route back to Trondheim in Norway after being blown off course.  The Foundation believe from their research that \u0026ldquoUig is the most likely place in the Hebrides that Vikings might have inhabited.  During his time on Lewis, Erikson fathered a child called Porkaetill, which means Thor\u0026rsquos cauldron, and is the precursor to the modern version of Torcuil.  The dedication ceremony was held on Wednesday afternoon with 24 members of the International Foundation in attendance.  Many of the local place names in the Hebrides are of Norse origin and Uig is also the location in which the Lewis chessmen were found in 1831.  According to the Sagas of Icelanders , Leif was the first European who landed in the territory of modern-day Canada.  But before that, he grew up in Greenland, where the family of Erik the Red moved after they colonized the land.  The details of his voyage in 1000 are a matter of historical debate, with one version claiming his landing was accidental while another said that he had sailed there intentionally after learning of the region from earlier explorers.  In the early 1960s, the discovery of the ruins of a Viking settlement in Newfoundland lent further weight to accounts of Eriksson\u0026rsquos voyage, and in 1964 the United States Congress authorized the president to proclaim each October 9 as Leif Eriksson Day.  According to a 13th-century Icelandic account The Saga of Erik the Red, Eriksson\u0026rsquos ships are said to have drifted off course on the return voyage home, finding dry ground at last on the North American continent.  It is believed they are most likely to have disembarked in what is now Nova Scotia, which Eriksson named Vinland, perhaps in reference to the wild grapes that his landing party saw there.  However, The Saga of the Greenlanders, which dates to the same era, suggests that Eriksson had heard already learned of \u0026ldquoVinland from another seamen, Bjarni Herj\u0026oacutelfsson, who had been there more than a decade earlier.  But regardless of his motives, Erikson is generally credited as the first European to set foot on the shores of North America, nearly five centuries before Christopher Columbus would arrive in 1492.  A Viking village from the 11th century was discovered in 1960, in L\u0026rsquoAnse aux Meadow, on the northernmost top of the island of Newfoundland. Archaeologists unearthed eight houses and food remains.  For many, the results of these excavations confirmed the expedition of Leif to North America. L\u0026rsquoAnse aux Meadow was declared Leif\u0026rsquos Vinland.  Now a UNESCO National Historic Site, it is the oldest European settlement to have been found in North America, and more than 2,000 Viking objects have been recovered from it, supporting accounts that Eriksson and his men wintered there before setting sail for home.  According to the 13th-century Saga of Erik the Red, in the year 1000, Leif travelled to Trondheim and on the way back to Greenland he he was blown off course to the Hebrides, which were then under Norse rule.  Joni Buchanan, chairwoman of the Uig Historical Society, now hopes the links with Erikson and the unveiling of the bust last week can boost visitor numbers which are already high due to the chessman.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is great that the International Foundation have recognised his links and have donated us a bust. It is another piece of Viking heritage for visitors to admire when they come to find out about the chess men.  \u0026ldquoLeif is believed to have blown off course on his way back to Greenland and Uig is his most likely place where he landed. He fathered a child here, called Torcuil, and he would later leave to join him in Greenland.  \u0026ldquoWe have a small museum here and about 80% of all our visitors come to lean about the chess man and how they came to be buried in the beach. \u0026ldquoNobody knows the answer but it is a fascinating story. They are still listed in the top ten things to do at the British Museum. Now some of them are in Stornoway Museum too and they still hold great appeal for visitors.  The Seattle-based Leif Erikson international foundation has already installed 22 statues across Scandinavia, Canada and the USA.  A spokesman for the |Foundations said: \u0026ldquoUig is the most likely place in the Hebrides that Vikings might have inhabited. Uig is also the location in which the Lewis chessmen were found in 1831.  \u0026ldquoThey are thought to have been made in Trondheim in the mid-12thcentury and there is no certainty about how they ended up in Uig, buried in the sands."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8194807.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-city-council-orders-removal-of-princes-st-black-out-fence","story":"  The organisers of the Summer Sessions erected the high barrier around the perimeter of Princes Street Gardens to obscure the view of concerts at the Ross Bandstand.  However Edinburgh City Council, which had been helping to promote the event, has now ordered it to be removed as soon as possible.  It follows complaints from Green MSP Andy Wightman and others that Princes Street Gardens are common land, and the public should not be denied a view of them.  The fences also restricted views of Edinburgh Castle, above the bandstand.  It is understood the council wants the fence removed within days.  However that could pose a security and safety problem for the organisers, DF Concerts, as there are still four concerts due to take place by August 19.    Once the barrier comes down, there would only be a modest railing between Princes Street and the bandstand, and there could be crowd issues with people seeking a free view.  It is understood council safety officers will discuss the practicalities on Monday.  Sir Tom Jones has already played the Summer Sessions, and this week\u0026rsquos performers are Rag\u0026rsquoN\u0026rsquoBone Man, Paloma Faith, Kasabian and Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  Earlier this year, Edinburgh City Council emphasised the event\u0026rsquos spectacular setting.  \u0026ldquoProviding a new music strand to the world famous Edinburgh Fringe, the shows will take place at the Ross Bandstand, with the breathtaking backdrop of Edinburgh Castle.  However SNP council leader Adam McVey said the fence marred that same setting.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom deeply concerned that the special character of Princes Street and the gardens is being seriously undermined by the erection of these barriers.  \u0026ldquoWhile ticketed events can provide a strong use for the current facilities, as we look to take forward a newly developed bandstand for the Capital, these events cannot be to the detriment of the city.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquoll be working with Council officers to explore how we can remove these barriers as soon as possible to reinstate what are public views and I\u0026rsquoll be seeking assurances that this doesn\u0026rsquot reoccur for any future events.  The Edinburgh heritage charity the Cockburn Association, which had complained about the fence, praised the \u0026ldquospeedy action from Cllr McVey to preserve much-loved public views.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of public concern and are looking into ways of improving the situation.  DF Concerts were asked for a comment."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-of-course-the-bbc-is-biased-but-the-bias-of-the-switch-off-campaigners-is-much-worse","story":"  How did I do? Was that a sentence we can agree on or not? Was it an example of media objectivity or was it dripping with anti-independence bias? Did I deliberately understate the size of the group? Were there, in reality, many more than 200 people there? Was the use of the word \u0026ldquocrowd pejorative and designed to de-legitimise the cause? Am I, in fact, part of a neo-liberal media that is out to use misinformation to undermine anti-establishment forces? In other words, was that innocent-seeming sentence about a protest at the BBC the fake truth or the real one?  If you think yes, there is a media campaign against Scottish independence, you may well have been at the protest on Saturday, or at least be sympathetic to the anti-BBC cause. According to one of the organisers, David McGuinness, BBC Scotland is London\u0026rsquos puppet in Scotland and does not represent the voices of the people (the voices of the people presumably being pro-independence despite the actual result of the 2014 referendum). The protest was also part of a wider, UK-wide campaign to encourage people to switch off the BBC because of its alleged bias against Labour and Jeremy Corbyn. And it has to be said, the campaign seemed to find a voice: last week, the hashtag BBCswitchoff was trending high on social media.  But what do the protesters actually mean when they say the BBC is biased? It can be hard to tell amid some of the more extreme online material, but it would seem that they believe the corporation is misrepresenting or suppressing the facts or is just plain lying in some cases. One of the placards on show in Glasgow suggested that the letters BBC now stood for Blatantly Biased and Corrupt.  Now, I suspect most reasonable people would pretty quickly dismiss the second of those accusations that the BBC is corrupt, but I think the use of the word \u0026ldquobiased is correct although not in the way that the protesters do. The BBC is a news organisation made up of human beings and to that extent it is not \u0026ndash and cannot be \u0026ndash immune from bias. As soon as a journalist at the BBC or anywhere else makes a decision to cover one story rather than another, or ask that question instead of that one, or use one particular phrase, he or she is working to the unconscious rules of their bias \u0026ndash even the way they apply the rules on impartiality may itself be subject to bias.  I have to say this isn\u0026rsquot necessarily a bad thing \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos just how human beings work: we have a whole set of rules in our heads (made up from our memories and experiences) that help us make decisions quickly but not always objectively. Journalists are the same, even if they think they\u0026rsquore not.  To be fair to the BBC, it does more than many news organisations to overcome this bias through the rules on impartiality, especially on controversial subjects such as Scottish independence. Anyone who has ever worked at BBC Scotland will know that its staff are just as divided on the subject as the staff at any other organisation (some for No, some for Yes), but I think the fact that the majority of its employees are middle-class \u0026ndash combined with the nature of the BBC itself ( a publicly-funded state organisation) \u0026ndashmay mean the unconscious bias of the corporation and its staff is towards the status quo and the establishment.  It is maybe this that the anti-BBC, switch-off protesters have been picking up, but what they fail to see is that their own bias runs much deeper. The protesters in Glasgow are desperate for Scottish independence to happen and would like most Scots to support it and so strong is this desire that they ignore or reject information that does not conform \u0026ndash hence their call to switch off the BBC and their bewildering refusal to meet with BBC management at Pacific Quay when they were offered. The protesters do not want anything to challenge their belief that theirs is a revolution driven by a hashtag, when actually it\u0026rsquos just naked bias masquerading as anti-bias.  What makes matters worse is that the campaigners then take to social media where their belief that the BBC is corrupt or anti-Scottish gains more and more plausibility in their heads because it is repeated so often in tweets. Psychologists have a phrase to describe this effect \u0026ndash availability cascade \u0026ndash and it leads to the ludicrous sight of nationalists getting angry at a BBC commentator for saying the Scottish swimmer Duncan Scott had \u0026ldquostolen a gold medal at the Euro Championships. And how about the tweeter who said she was sick of BBC bias so was off to subscribe to the Morning Star? In other words, the campaigners don\u0026rsquot want objectivity \u0026ndash they want a bias that agrees with theirs.  I also find the fury of the anti-BBC protesters a little hard to understand for the simple reason that their campaign probably doesn\u0026rsquot matter. The campaigners appear to believe that bias at the corporation is somehow preventing the pro-independence cause from breaking through by warping the minds of people who might otherwise vote yes, but that\u0026rsquos the same mindset that believed it was The Sun wot won it for the Conservatives in the 1992 General Election (it didn\u0026rsquot).  In fact, in a social-media-driven society like ours, media bias just isn\u0026rsquot that powerful. What happens is that, instead of people changing their minds due to bias, they drift to media that agrees with their own bias and so become firmer in whatever beliefs they already had. This helps explain the fury of the anti-BBC protesters fed on pro-nationalist websites, but perhaps they should go home and chill out for one simple reason. Most people in Scotland now know where they stand on independence and the chances of their opinions being changed by the BBC \u0026ndash even if it was blatantly biased and corrupt \u0026ndash are very small indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"p1-testing-rollout-was-a-mess-say-one-third-of-parents","story":"  A survey shows only seven per cent of respondents thought the introduction of standardised national assessments in literacy and numeracy for pupils in P1 was \u0026ldquowell handled.  Sixty per cent had a \u0026ldquonegative view of the tests, with more than one-third overall having a very \u0026ldquonegative view of the process.  The social media poll of more than 364 parents across the country by parent body Connect found one- third thought that, in general, the tests had been handled well, but they would have liked more information.  The poll comes as pressure is mounting on the Scottish Government to scrap the P1 literacy and numeracy assessments, which teachers said have left some pupils \u0026ldquoshaking and crying.  The Scottish Liberal Democrats are already pressing for a parliamentary vote on the issue unless the assessments are scrapped.  However, Education Secretary John Swinney said Government guidance on the administration of the assessments was clear there should be no distress.  The tests in P1 are part of a raft of new assessments to help teachers judge the progress of pupils, with further testing in P4, P7 and S3. The Government argues testing in the first year of primary is important because it gives an idea of what level pupils are at when they come to school.  However, the online survey by Connect found 60% of those who responded expressed a \u0026ldquonegative or \u0026ldquovery negative view of them. Just 8% were positive.  Parents were also concerned about the lack of information provided by schools, with 70% not knowing their child was taking an assessment and 94% not having any feedback. More than 90% of parents were unaware they could opt for their child not to take the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of Connect, said the organisation was \u0026ldquovery concerned about the ways in which assessments were being implemented in some schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoTechnology does not always seem to be available for children to take assessments in their own classrooms. Some parents report that this has been upsetting and confusing for their child.  \u0026ldquoNot only are the tests for P1s flying in the face of Curriculum for Excellence principles, they are simply not appropriate. Research shows children at this age should be learning through play.  \u0026ldquoThe tests continue the formalisation of the early level curriculum to the detriment of many. This was a view regularly expressed by teachers and headteachers who responded to another survey amongst professionals carried out on behalf of Connect.  The survey also highlighted considerable differences in the approaches schools used to explain the assessments to children. Some were told it was a game on the computer while some were told they were having a test.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country. However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoAssessments are not a new concept and the vast majority of local authorities have been carrying them out for years.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish National Standardised Assessments ensure for the first time that all schools will undertake the same assessments, providing consistency and an important means for teachers to identify children\u0026rsquos next steps in learning. That is especially valuable in early years if we are to continue to close the attainment gap.  \u0026ldquoOur approach was developed after extensive engagement with teachers, parents, children and academics. Teachers have the flexibility to manage the assessments to ensure that they are a positive experience for all children.  Mr Swinney said a government review of teacher feedback from the first year of the assessments was taking place and ministers would shortly set out changes and enhancements to the system for next year."},{"url":null,"title":"commuters-may-see-rail-fares-rise-by-35-next-year","story":"  This would increase the annual cost of getting to work for many long-distance travellers by more than \u0026pound150.  The exact fare rise will be confirmed when the July Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation is released by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday.  But economists from Investec and EY Item Club both predict the figure will be announced as 3.5%.  The Department for Transport (DfT) uses July\u0026rsquos RPI to determine the annual increase in regulated train fares, which comes into force every January.  Regulated fares include season tickets on most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long distance journeys and Anytime tickets around major cities.  These fares went up by 3.6% this year.  In January the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said RPI has \u0026ldquono merit, adding that \u0026ldquovirtually everyone recognises the alternative Consumer Prices Index (CPI).  Rail campaigners want CPI to be used to determine regulated fare increases, as it is generally lower than RPI.  The introduction of a new timetable caused widespread chaos in the north of England and on various London commuter lines. Thousands of passengers are still waiting to receive enhanced compensation.  The disruption led to the Government vetoing further timetable changes expected in December, which means upgrades in areas such as the West Midlands, the west of England and South Western Railway routes have been cancelled or delayed indefinitely.  A Campaign for Better Transport spokesman urged the Government to \u0026ldquocommit to a fares freeze.  He said: \u0026ldquoGiven the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation, the Government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified.  Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs\u0026rsquo Association, told the Press Association that services are in \u0026ldquofree fall.  He said: \u0026ldquoJustice for passengers means dropping the annual rip-off rise and also simplifying the Byzantine fare structure which privatisation has imposed.  \u0026ldquoBetter still, end this costly farce. Put passengers before profits by bringing our railways back into public ownership.  And Labour\u0026rsquos shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoChris Grayling\u0026rsquos handling of our railways is now beyond a joke.  \u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos failure means passengers have faced truly staggering fare rises, with fares having increased three times as much as wages.  \u0026ldquoLabour is calling on the Government to freeze rail fares on the routes most severely affected by the timetable changes \u0026ndash Govia Thameslink, Arriva Rail North and First Transpennine Express \u0026ndash as a small gesture of goodwill towards those passengers who have suffered and continue to suffer the worst of the timetabling chaos.  The rail industry has pledged to remove jargon from tickets and journey information for half a million train routes next month.  A DfT spokesman said: \u0026ldquoAny fare increase is unwelcome, but it is not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do.  \u0026ldquoTaxpayers already subsidise the network by more than \u0026pound4 billion a year \u0026ndash meaning that 38% of our transport budget is spent on the 2% of journeys that the railway accounts for.  He added that fare increases are helping to pay for extra carriages and services, as well as upgrades on the Great Western Main Line and the Transpennine route.  Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, said: \u0026ldquoOf every pound spent on train fares, 98p is invested back into the railway, helping to underpin a once-in-a-generation investment to change and improve for the benefit of our customers, local communities and UK economy.  Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: \u0026ldquoThis is another kick in the teeth for Britain\u0026rsquos passengers who are being robbed blind by greedy train operators for travelling in rammed out and unreliable services while the shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank.  \u0026ldquoThe continuing scandal on Northern Rail is just one example of what\u0026rsquos wrong and the only serious solution is public ownership.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoScotRail\u0026rsquos fares increases are generally lower, on average, than those elsewhere in the UK.  \u0026ldquoThis is a result of our policy to place a cap that is lower than RPI on regulated off-peak fares increases, whereas the UK Government applies an increase at the level of RPI to all regulated fares."},{"url":null,"title":"widows-of-israeli-athletes-disturbed-by-corbyn-pictures","story":"  Ankie Spitzer and Ilana Romano, whose husbands Andre and Yossef were among 11 athletes taken hostage and killed at the 1972 Munich Olympics, warned the Labour leader that he would be \u0026ldquojudged by the company you keep.

The pictures emerged amid continuing controversy over Labour\u0026rsquos refusal to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, including a list of examples of anti-Semitic behaviour.  Three senior union leaders have added their voices to calls from deputy leader Tom Watson for the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance text to be incorporated in its entirety into Labour\u0026rsquos new code of conduct on anti-Semitism.  Labour has launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party\u0026rsquos ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.  A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises its examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases.  \u0026ldquoThe NEC upheld the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism, but in recognition of the serious concerns expressed, agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views.  Writing in the Sunday Mirror, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: \u0026ldquoBoth Jeremy Corbyn and I have made clear that racism and anti-Semitism have no place in the Labour Party.  \u0026ldquoLabour will resolve any outstanding issues within our party and get out there to assist the Jewish community in fighting anti-Semitism and racism."},{"url":null,"title":"olympic-cyclist-chris-boardman-speaks-out-over-new-road-safety-laws","story":"  Boardman, whose own mother was killed by a truck when cycling in 2016, said he felt \u0026ldquogenuinely sick after seeing the message on the official party Twitter feed.  Cycling minister Jesse Norman apologised after the message sparked a hail of angry responses from bike-users.  It came as Mr Norman announced plans for new road safety laws, including\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspoffences of causing death by dangerous or careless cycling, which would see cyclists who kill pedestrians treated in a similar way to drivers.  Mr Norman insisted that the changes were intended to protect \u0026ldquovulnerable road users, including cyclists.  But cycling campaigners said he was simply \u0026ldquotinkering around the edges of road safety.  The laws are being proposed by the Government after 44-year-old mother-of-two Kim Briggs was knocked over and killed by a bicycle courier in February 2016.  The message on the Conservative Twitter feed said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore launching a consultation into dangerous cycling so that our most vulnerable road users are protected.          I genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account. @Jesse_Norman https://t.co/m4QO8229Vn          \u0026mdash Chris Boardman (@Chris_Boardman) August 12, 2018  Boardman responded: \u0026ldquoThat says it all really. Wow, just wow. I\u0026nbsp genuinely thought this was a bad joke, had to check it was a real account.  Urging other cyclists to complain to Mr Norman and his party, he added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not me that needs to know how you feel \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos me, with the dead mother, crushed to death by a car by the way. It makes me feel genuinely sick.  Carol Boardman died aged 75 when she was run over by a pick-up truck while on a bike ride near Connah\u0026rsquos Quay in north Wales.  BBC radio presenter Jeremy Vine also spoke out about the Tory message.  \u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom on a bike, I\u0026rsquom a vulnerable road user, said Vine.  \u0026ldquoIn 2016 there were 1,700 road deaths three were caused by cyclists.

On behalf of all involved, I would like to apologise.  Mr Boardman said Norman was \u0026ldquoone of the good guys, if only his party would empower him to do more.  In recent weeks the Department for Transport has announced a series of measures to protect vulnerable road users, including:  \u0026ndash Funding to give driving instructors training to ensure cyclists\u0026rsquo safety is prioritised.  \u0026ndash Better investigation of crashes.  \u0026ndash Investing \u0026pound100 million to improve dangerous roads.  The latest announcement includes the introduction of national guidance for cycling and walking infrastructure and updating parts of the Highway Code to combat close passing of bicycles.  Ms Briggs\u0026rsquo widower Matthew supports the proposed new laws.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis public consultation is an important step towards updating the arcane laws that are currently being used to prosecute cycling offences.  Ms Briggs was killed by Charlie Alliston, then 18, who was travelling at 18mph on a fixed-wheel track bike with no front brakes.  He was sentenced to 18 months in jail after being found guilty of causing bodily harm by \u0026ldquowanton and furious driving.  The Victorian legislation, originally drafted to deal with reckless handling of horses, was used because there was no cycling equivalent to the offence of causing death by dangerous driving.  Department for Transport (DfT) figures for 2016 show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain\u0026rsquos roads, but only three cases involved bicycles.  National charity Cycling UK claimed a \u0026ldquofull review of road traffic offences is required.  Cycling UK head of campaigns Duncan Dollimore described the current system of prosecuting and sentencing for careless or dangerous drivers as \u0026ldquosomething of a lottery which leaves victims and their relatives \u0026ldquofeeling massively let down.  He went on: \u0026ldquoAdding one or two new offences specific to cyclists would be merely tinkering around the edges.  \u0026ldquoIf the Government is serious about addressing behaviour that puts others at risk on our roads, they should grasp the opportunity to do the job properly, rather than attempt to patch up an area of legislation that\u0026rsquos simply not working.  Mr Norman said: \u0026ldquoAll these measures are designed to support the continued growth of cycling and walking, with all the benefits they bring to our communities, economy, environment and society."},{"url":null,"title":"omagh-bombing-relatives-remember-loved-ones-on-20-year-anniversary","story":"  An inter-dominational remembrance service is taking place at the memorial garden in the Co Tyrone town.  Twenty-nine people, including a pregnant woman with twins, were killed in the car bomb ripped through Omagh on August 15, 1998.  The victims came from Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, England and Spain.  The atrocity was claimed by a republican splinter group which called itself the Real IRA.  Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable, George Hamilton, former Ombudsman Baroness Nuala O\u0026rsquoLoan, and Ireland\u0026rsquos Health Minister Simon Harris, are among those attending the event.  Ireland\u0026rsquos premier Leo Varadkar and British Secretary of State Karen Bradley were both criticised for their decision not to attend the 20th anniversary.

The choir includes Cara McGillion, 17, the daughter of Donna Marie and Garry who were left seriously injured in the attack.  Michael Gallagher, whose son Aiden was among those killed, paid tribute to all the victims of the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict, including the La Mon hotel IRA bombing which killed members of a local collie club in 1978.  The service included speeches from victims campaigners from the US and was attended by Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable George Hamilton and a representative of the Irish Government, among others.  Relatives of the dead sat opposite the reflecting pool at the memorial garden, their garlands of flowers reflected in the pool.  A song was sung for Our Special Absent Friends.

The meeting on Monday at a North Korea-controlled building in the border village of Panmunjom comes amid growing worries about whether North Korea will begin abandoning its nuclear weapons, something officials suggested would happen after Mr Kim\u0026rsquos summit with US president Donald Trump in June in Singapore.  North Korea is thought to have a growing arsenal of nuclear bombs and long-range missiles and to be closing in on the ability to reliably target anywhere on the US mainland.  A string of weapons tests last year, during which Pyongyang claimed to have completed its nuclear arsenal, had many in Asia worried that Washington and Pyongyang were on the brink of war.  After a peace offering by Mr Kim in January, Mr Moon was able to orchestrate his own summits with Mr Kim, which were followed by Mr Kim and Mr Trump\u0026rsquos meeting in June.  The South Korean delegation for Monday\u0026rsquos talks is led by Cho Myoung-gyon, who oversees Seoul\u0026rsquos Unification Ministry that handles inter-Korean issues, and includes Nam Gwan-pyo, a Moon aide responsible for North Korean nuclear matters.  The North Korean delegation is led by Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North\u0026rsquos agency that deals with inter-Korean affairs. North Korea, which proposed Monday\u0026rsquos talks last week, also sent officials overseeing past inter-Korean economic collaborations.  In opening remarks, the head of the North Korean delegation set a positive tone for the day\u0026rsquos meeting, comparing the current state of inter-Korean relations to very close friends where nothing can stand between the two.  \u0026ldquoWe are attending this talk with an intention to get some good outcomes, Mr Ri told the South Korean delegation, according to pool reports. He added that continuing the discussions on the two leaders\u0026rsquo summit in Pyongyang would help improve the inter-Korean ties.  \u0026ldquoWe will listen to the North\u0026rsquos stance on the inter-Korean summit for this fall, which is agreed upon in the Panmunjom declaration, and share our views, Mr Cho told reporters before heading to the border, referring to the agreement at the April summit.  The meeting between Seoul and Pyongyang comes as experts see slow progress on efforts to disarm North Korea since the Singapore summit.  Pyongyang urged Washington to reciprocate its goodwill gestures, which include suspending missile and nuclear tests and returning the remains of Americans who fought in the Korean War.  Washington, which cancelled an annual joint military exercise with South Korea that had taken place in August in previous years, has refused to ease sanctions until North Korea finally and fully denuclearises."},{"url":null,"title":"britains-best-home-cook-to-return-for-second-series","story":"  Mary Berry will return for another eight episodes alongside\u0026nbspchef Dan Doherty and produce expert Chris Bavin to judge more home cooks hoping to be crowned the winner.

Among teetotallers, around 70% were asked if there was something wrong due to refusing alcohol. The greatest concern for Scottish respondents abstaining from drinking was the fear of appearing boring, at 60%, on a par with elsewhere in the UK.  However, fear of being left out was greater in Scotland than the UK average, at 50% compared with 36%.  Researchers found one in three Scottish men felt vulnerable on the dance floor sober, compared with just 12% across the UK. Nearly 80% of Scottish respondents reported social events as the top trigger for drinking, 4% above the UK average.  In Scotland, men were 18% more likely than women to be pressed into drinking by friends, increasing to 20% at social events.

It follows a run of difficult weather for farmers in 2018, with \"the Beast from the East\" cold spell followed by a heatwave this summer.  Mr Ewing said: \"Farmers are the backbone of Scotland\u0027s rural economy, and we understand that many of them have really suffered this year due to the unprecedented severe weather experienced in 2018.  \"The Scottish Government is of course committed to supporting our farmers, and have responded by taking decisive action to make this extra funding stream available.  \"We will be issuing loan offers shortly, providing a much-needed cash injection for those feeling the effects of increased prices for feed and fodder, the impact of restraints on irrigating their land, and in some cases resorting to selling livestock earlier than planned to preserve fodder for breeding stocks.\"  Mr Ewing said he has also asked experts to consider what other actions may be helpful in response to the recent dry weather.  The funding will be available on an opt-in basis, with individual loan offers expected to be sent to farmers from early September.

Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point. However it has been suggested at the Turriff Show by MSPs present that if individual farmers believe they will be severely disadvantaged by not being able to access the new road and continue to use only the existing road network, that they make that case to Transport Scotland.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"relief map celebrates bond between scotland and poland","story":"        November 11 this year will be a poignant date for many people here in Scotland.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 13, 2018 at 11:38 amCar park attendants in Orkney are to trial the use of personal video cameras as a safety measure.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants. We offer a full service which takes the hassle away from the owner and gives them peace of mind that we will manage the whole lettings process, ensure the rent is paid, and find the best possible tenant.\"Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this.

People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Monday 13 Aug 2018 12:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Edinburgh could become the first local authority area in Scotland to charge companies for allowing employees to park at work.                Councillors are considering a workplace parking levy, which could also include customer parking, as part of a campaign to cut congestion and air pollution.            The SNP-Labour administration’s transport and environment committee has agreed to investigate setting up the scheme and will “set out the argument and rationale” for the charge.            In Nottingham, which in 2010 became the first place in the UK to introduce the levy, businesses are charged £402 each year per space and the money goes towards transport improvements, including extending the city’s tram network. Employers can choose to reclaim the cost of the levy from their employees. All organisations and premises with more than ten parking places are liable for the charge.Scottish councils would need permission from the Scottish Government to introduce the charge, which could be achieved through an amendment to its Transport Bill.The levy is backed by transport group Transform Scotland, which has said it could be applied to “workplaces as well as other types of premises”, raising the prospect of out-of-town shopping centres having to pay the levy to provide free parking to customers. Edinburgh’s transport and environment convener Lesley Macinnes said: “We’re still at a very early stage and our next steps will involve setting out an argument and rationale for introducing a workplace parking levy in order to seek the necessary legislative changes from the Scottish Government to introduce such a measure.“However, we’re confident that introducing a workplace parking levy would achieve many benefits – reducing the number of car journeys made into the city and in turn lowering congestion, improving air quality and encouraging active travel.            “This would very much be part of our broader ambitions to transform the way we use the city centre, including the introduction of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and proposals for city centre transformation.”It is hoped the levy would generate around £9 million a year to pay for improvements to Edinburgh’s transport network, but council officers said the annual revenue could be as much as £15m.A report to councillors said: “Edinburgh is a commuter work destination. We have issues with our road maintenance and investment in transport infrastructure.“Introducing a workplace parking levy in Edinburgh would be an example of devolving further responsibility and powers to local authorities and could support investment in our transport infrastructure and maintenance.”            Conservatives opposed the council’s stance on introducing the policy and asked for a balanced report on the positives and negatives of the levy.Nick Cook said: “We are almost setting an assumption that the council is in favour of introducing a workplace parking levy.”His Conservative colleague Scott Douglas added: “It seems like we are putting the cart before the horse. I think we should take time to consider it in both pros and cons with it. I also have concerns over business engagement with it.”Green councillor Chas Booth asked the committee whether there was “an opportunity to include customer parking as well” in the scheme. He said: “Some recognise it as a missing link in sustainable transport.”The committee agreed to include looking at a “wider non-residential parking levy which could also cover customer parking spaces”.            Plans for a LEZ have been billed as having the potential to “leave a legacy” for future generations.The council is carrying out an eight-week public consultation on how to shape the future of transport in Edinburgh.A prospectus outlining three visions, including a radical approach where the city centre would be “largely traffic-free”, will form the start of a long consultation process with the public.Key roads across Edinburgh will be closed to traffic once a month in what will also be a Scottish first. The traffic-free days, which could shut down areas including Portobello and Stockbridge, are due to start early next year."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782243.1533918106!/image/image.jpg","title":"interview rose mcgowan is out to expose the real hollywood","story":"        Rose McGowan, one of the first women to make public allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, has become a lightning rod for the #MeToo movement. The writer and campaigner talks to Janet Christie about misogyny and movies ahead of her Edinburgh International Book Festival appearance                If there’s one word that sums up activist, former actor, director, author, model and singer, Rose McGowan, one of the first to publicly speak out against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, now accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 90 women, it’s ‘brave’. Brave, the title of her memoir and manifesto is a call to arms for us all to wake up to the misogyny of the entertainment industry and beyond, her bid to give voice to the victims of sexism and violence and to join her Rose Army of free thinkers striving to make things better and reclaim their lives.             Set for the Edinburgh International Book Festival, McGowan comes on the phone from London, excited about her appearance and keen to spread the word.            Raw and revealing, the book follows McGowan from a childhood growing up in the Children of God cult, to Hollywood and movies, through her relationships with rocker Marilyn Manson and director Robert Rodriguez, through her alleged attack by Weinstein and its aftermath, to her reawakening and speaking out. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: The shows that were inspired by #MeTooArticulate and intelligent, she responds to questions without equivocation. This Rose is attractive and friendly, yet she has thorns.“It’s about getting braver in our lives by at least 10 per cent – I think that’s a do-able number. We sweep things under the rug because we’re too scared to confront them, but I’m here to tell you if you just go through it, if you look at the wound you can clean it, don’t let it fester, let it heal then you can have a free life. But if you continually cover the sore and pretend it’s not there, it will eat away at you. Bravery isn’t just you being brave out in the world, it’s also with yourself.” In Brave, McGowan says the alleged attack by Weinstein happened in his hotel suite at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when she was invited there after a screening of her film Going All the Way. McGowan says he later contacted her but she rebuffed his advances and after accepting a payment of $100,000, which she says she took as an acknowledgment of what had taken place, she says she was blacklisted by Weinstein and her career sidelined.            She doesn’t name him in her book, she’s taken back control and won’t have “The Monster’s” name in it – today she calls him “that warthog from hell”. Of his refusal to acknowledge what she says happened, she says simply, “Of course. Which just makes you feel terrible. Every time his lawyers say ‘consensual’ it gives me a body flashback and makes me sick to my stomach, consensual my ass. Like I would ever let that warthog from hell touch me. I wish he would cease to exist. I just wish he was not on the planet anymore, just cease.”McGowan had always spoken about the alleged attack privately, but her battle against Hollywood became public when she discovered the power of Twitter in 2015. After receiving a casting note for an audition for an Adam Sandler film that suggested she wear a form fitting top, push up bra and show some cleavage, she rolled her eyes, posted it on Twitter and went to bed. In the morning she woke up to an internet storm of support, calling out Hollywood’s sexism.Did she think ‘oh brilliant’, or ‘oh no, what have I done?’She laughs, “Kind of both. At first I thought ‘oh no’, then I thought actually that’s brilliant, then I thought ‘oh no’ again. It’s very strange when things go viral and you’re in people’s heads, on their phones, it’s powerful and weird and nice being on the other side of it.”            Silenced in the world of Hollywood, the internet was an arena in which McGowan found her voice. “There was no way to speak out if someone was controlling the media and dominating it. But they can’t control the internet, you have your freedom and your access route.”So when Fox promoted the new X-Men film with an image of Jennifer Lawrence being strangled, she published online an open letter of objection, part of a backlash against the promotion that saw it withdrawn. Writing in her book she says, “I felt an obligation to be a voice for women, people who had suffered from violence.”• READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book Festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpBut why does McGowan think it’s on her to object, why does she have this strong sense of obligation?             “It sometimes feels like if I don’t, who else is going to? If not me, then who, and why not me? I have a special tool set. I’ve dealt with some of the big baddies and I’ve had a lot of hardship and I’ve battled through them and I’ve survived. And I know you can help others get to the other side. “I’ve always had a thing for justice, I don’t know what it is, I just don’t like seeing misjustice and I certainly don’t like predators.” McGowan spears Hollywood’s misogyny in Brave, pointing out that in 2016 only 23 per cent of speaking roles on screen were female, the majority in horror films. “And we know how they get treated,” she writes. Further, The Directors Guild of America is 96 per cent male, and has been since 1946, which McGowan argues means that for your entire life you have been fed a steady diet of largely male thought and bias about women. “Why is 96 per cent of our information, entertainment and philosophy coming from men?... Film and television is a white male’s playground and through their narrow vision comes the manipulated mirror you’re largely forced to see yourself in. If that’s not malewashing I don’t know what is.”With an online following calling out sexism, when people started talking about harassment by Trump in 2016, McGowan didn’t hesitate to join #whywomendontreport (their sexual assault) debate.  “Trump helped elucidate what sexism and racism are, filled it out in big burning block letters and people went ‘oh, that’s what this is’. Thanks Trump!” She laughs.McGowan says she is speaking up for people like her, the disenfranchised, the hurt, the lost, the lonely, the brave ones who choose to live their lives differently, see things differently and function in a society that doesn’t want them in their own way. “The Rose Army is an army of thought,” she says. “We stand for freedom of spirit and mind. We stand for dissent. We stand for equality and the right to have our lives be unencumbered by proscribed thoughts and traditional mores.” McGowan’s book festival appearance is tied to the theme of identity, and the idea of whether we choose our own identity or have one forced upon us.“I grew up in a really unusual way that led me to have my own identity and not be co-opted,” she says, “and then later as an actor I played multiple identities so identity has always been a really interesting idea for me.”Now 44, it was growing up among the Children of God in rural Tuscany in the Seventies that McGowan first learnt to retreat into her own head, rejecting the rules of the cult. Then later after the family escaped and returned to America, she was bounced among relatives, but found solace in reading, identifying with the persona of each book’s protagonist, a harbinger of her later career. “I used my training from books, absolutely, it’s the only acting training I’ve ever had,” she says. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: 18 must-see shows picked by The Scotsman’s criticsIf McGowan’s childhood reads as traumatic, she also manages to convey the pleasure she and the pack of cult children took in their Tuscan playground, the rows of marching cypresses and olive groves, despite often being hungry, confused and scared. And it was growing up in a cult that made her alert to the mechanics of control when she arrived in the US, then later in Hollywood.“When I came out of the Children of God everybody was saying how weird it was, how I lived and grew up, and I just thought ‘well, it’s weird how you live, you’re living under the same kind of dictates, you’re just not aware of it’. Everything was the same except bigger and more diluted. I thought ‘if you think you’re free, you’re not’. I was really shocked to find how the same belief systems being utilised, but a more internalised version.”After leaving home at 15, she headed to LA where she was discovered standing on a street corner and offered a part on a film, Paul Shore’s 1992 comedy Encino Man. To the hungry and homeless McGowan, it was a means of survival. “I was a journeyman actor, it was not my love, it was just something I happened to be good at.”Success followed with The Doom Generation and she made her breakthrough in horror flick Scream, then headlined in Going All the Way, Devil in the Flesh and Jawbreaker, yet by the end of the 1990s, according to McGowan because she was being sidelined, the big film roles had dried up. Switching to TV she was a lead in supernatural series Charmed from 2001-6, then in a return to film starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s double-feature film Grindhouse in 2007. Parts in Fifty Dead Men Walking, Conan and other films followed then in 2014 she realised an ambition and made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed short film Dawn, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.Since Dawn McGowan’s time has been taken up with Brave and the creation of a multimedia album, Planet 9, released in January at the same time as the book.“I’m really excited about performing it at my first music festival in Norway in November,” she says. “Planet 9 is kind of the other side of the book, where you go once your brain has been changed. It’s a place I invented, then astronomers found a Planet 9 four years ago – I almost fell off my chair! So I started writing songs for this place, and music. It’s my sanity. My art projects are what has kept me sane, that and my therapy.”McGowan is also writing a second book, on the subject of trust, a behind the scenes story of her life as she set about telling her story, a time in which she says ex-Mossad agents hired by Weinstein to quash misconduct allegations, followed her. “What is trust, how do we do it? I had to learn how to trust, otherwise you’re never going to trust anybody again in your entire life.”Given her experiences, how many people does she trust in her life now?“I trust about seven people,” she says, “and then the rest of the world, I hope,” she laughs.Seven’s quite a lot, I tell her.“Yeah, I’m doing pretty good,” she laughs and reconsiders. “Maybe it’s about three or four.”Fighting the Hollywood machine would deplete your faith in human nature, not to mention your resources. Ask McGowan where she lives now, and she comes straight back with “Nowhere.“I don’t have a house. I sold it to pay legal bills, so now I just travel. I live in hotels, airbnbs, on friends’ couches. Fighting the machine is not cheap, and they’re trying to bankrupt me.” • READ MORE: Edinburgh book festival chief hits out at visa issues facing international writersAnother front in McGowan’s fight against misogyny comes in the shape of the face cream she has developed with her aunt. It sounds unlikely at first, why is she dabbling in face cream? Yet as she talks you see her logic. “I want to disrupt the beauty industry,” she says. This is the woman who back in 2015 cut off her “long, glossy Kardashian-esque hair. I thought I looked more like a blow-up sex doll… I had been turned into the ultimate fantasy f*** toy by the Hollywood machine. I was dying on the inside and embarrassed by what I looked like on the outside.” And shorn of her hair, the real McGowan came out fighting. “And everyone complains about unrealistic beauty standards, but nobody really looks at it from a class point of view. I think it’s deeply classist, that if you don’t want chemicals you have to pay $150. It’s all part of the bigger scheme, of the way they keep women down. You pay them less and charge them more.“I’ve found an amazing laboratory that’s not connected to the expensive companies, to make an amazing product, that’s natural, and unisex.”And because this is McGowan we’re talking about, it’s not just dewy skin she’s after, there’s a bigger goal. “Ten per cent of the income is going to a centre which will provide long-term care for victims of violence, and I want some day to start a spa staffed by domestic violence and human trafficking victims. When people’s finances and self-esteem have been torn apart, they have no idea how to operate in the world but we can set them up so they can train others. So it becomes kind of like a school, that’s the company I’m building,” she says.“I hope to keep changing the world and do good for others. And make great art.” And when she sees the lengths people have gone to to try and shut her up…...“they’re still going,” she says.But she’s still going too...“Yep.”...does she ever feel overwhelmed? “Sometimes I get overwhelmed... a little. But the only way to change things is to lift the blanket and shine a light on the darkness. My goal is to expose Hollywood for what it really is. I have a million more stories I could tell in this book, but I don’t have the energy to document all of the dickery.” She laughs, exasperated, but determined. “In the book I say I’m like a phoenix and with this book, I rose again.”• Rose McGowan with Afua Hirsch is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Monday, Baillie Gifford Main Theatre, 3:15pm, £12, (£10).

Watching the cosy Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing programme the other night, in which these national comedy treasures discuss and compare heart operations, I felt compelled to search the internet for a previous Fast Show character whose name I couldn’t remember.            Eventually, I managed to track down Indecisive Dave, played by Whitehouse in the early 90s.            The nub of these sketches is based on a guy who offers an opinion on something, say the England football team or crime, then changes his mind as soon as someone challenges him.It’s clear that Dave doesn’t really have strong opinions on anything and is just trying to keep his end up in the pub chat stakes with his mates – who are more decisive than him. Dave would probably fall into the ‘don’t know’ camp when it comes to things like referendums and voting at elections.The don’t knows are a group of people who have reached a certain stage in life where they’re happy to admit that they don’t know all or any of the answers.No less a figure than Socrates – the ancient Greek philosopher, not the Brazilian footballer who ended up playing for Garforth Town – was also big on the don’t knows.Quoted by Plato, he says: “I do not think that a thing could be such an evil for a man, as much as having a false opinion concerning the things about which our discussion is about.”            I would put myself firmly in the don’t-know camp on a range of issues, chief among them: how to solve the Israel/Palestine conflict, what a post-Brexit UK should look like, should Scotland be independent, why don’t we just use the Forth Road Bridge during roadworks, and will Rangers finish second in the Scottish Premiership this season. READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Age of Uncertainty may see SNP wipeout or a new TrumpIt’s liberating to admit you don’t know something, especially in an age when polarisation is taking place to the right and left of politics in the UK, Europe and the United States.The rise of the Scottish Twitterati has seen a host of commentators crawling out the woodwork. These bright, young (annoying) things will give a strong opinion on anything at a moment’s notice as soon as the BBC call. No sitting on the fence, no room for discussion or subtle nuance – no, in they jump, giving it the full Katie Hopkins before taking to Twitter to signpost their latest musings.             Being Scottish in this day and age calls for taking sides and shouting loudly – we don’t really do discussions, only arguments and fence-sitters need not apply.I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time arguing in pubs about subjects as diverse as: are tennis players fitter than footballers, who would win if Muhammad Ali fought Mike Tyson, is Easter Road Stadium in Leith, and could Rocky take the Terminator in a square go?As the pints flow, the voices rise to a crescendo nobody is listening to anyone else and whoever shouts the loudest is deemed the winner – it’s great fun but does little to increase understanding. It seems that this culture has taken over in Scottish society. Like most sons, I always ask my father for advice, probably too much. Only last week, I phoned him to ask what I thought about Jeremy Corbyn. This has led to me being mercilessly ribbed by mates who stick the “my dad says” label on any opinion I happen to give. Asking your dad is, for the most part, a good idea – unless your dad’s a serial killer or someone like Joseph Stalin, if that’s the case it would probably be better to ask your mum.             Clearly there are some things that nobody knows, but this doesn’t deter the foolhardy.Sports journalism, in particular, is one area where any amount of daft questions are permitted.“Do you think team X or player Y can win the league, match, cup, whatever?” is standard practice for your average hack. Of course, the real answer is almost always “don’t know” as the event hasn’t taken place. The late, great Celtic manager Jock Stein understood this more than most when he proclaimed: “Only a fool would try to predict the score in an Old Firm game.”READ MORE: Socrates has the answer to Scotland’s problemsBookies exist because we think we know something when we don’t. How many times did you hear someone proclaim, “I fancy Tiger Woods for the Open” last month or any other golfer for that matter. All well and good but there were 155 other competitors in that event.So, who is going to stand up for the don’t knows? Sir Vince Cable is being touted as starting an anti-Brexit Centrist Party but he’s an unlikely knight in shining armour, although he doesn’t seem to know much so that would probably make him an ideal candidate.It would be a good idea to have another political party at some point with a nice centrist position kind of like New Labour – before Tony Blair decided he was in the SAS. They could certainly sweep up the ‘don’t knows’ and provide a much-needed alternative.My message to everyone is give saying “don’t know” or “dinnae ken” a go.

We may despair at the pitiful sight of high streets, the length and breadth of the country, that once buzzed with life and are now characterised by their boarded-up shop fronts and neglected buildings. But we know, too, that busy streets mean increased pollution.            And so some balance must be found which allows towns and cities to thrive while encouraging a more environmentally friendly approach to their day-to-day running.            Edinburgh is luckier than most towns and cities when it comes to sustaining local businesses. The capital city’s skilled workforce and regular stream of tourists means there is great support for city centre shops and other companies. But this success, inevitably, has an environmental impact.And so we are always willing to listen to suggestions for how pollution in Edinburgh might be reduced without a negative impact on business.The city council’s transport and environment committee might have a workable solution.Under plans being considered, companies could be charged for allowing employees and even customers to park outside their offices.A similar scheme in Nottingham sees companies charged £402-per-annum for each private parking space they own, with the money being invested in the city’s transport network. The logic is sound – if a company adds to congestion by encouraging employees to use cars, then why shouldn’t it help to offset that environmental damage by investing in public transport?            But before we rally behind this proposal, we’d like some reassurance that it is both reasonable and potentially effective.Businesses, already burdened with a range of costs, may take some persuading that being charged hundreds of pounds for each parking space they use is fair. If costs threaten to run into many tens of thousands of pounds for larger employers which have private car parks, then there is surely a risk of them choosing to relocate outside the city centre.No city – even one as vibrant as Edinburgh – can afford to adopt policies that drive away employers.Increasing taxes is sometimes a heavy-handed answer to problems that requires a more thoughtful solutions."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782826.1534146796!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch bbc struggles to accept scottish independence isn t a phase","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Now that many south of the Border are objecting to BBC bias, matters may come to a head, says Lesley Riddoch                The BBC has had a rather bad August.            It started with a row over the YouTube channel run by Scottish independence blogger Wings Over Scotland which was closed down by YouTube after BBC Scotland complaints about breaches of copyright. After a storm of protest Aunty withdrew the objections prompting YouTube to reinstate the channel.             Interviewed on Radio Scotland, BBC Scotland’s head of public policy, Ian Small explained the BBC felt forced to act when a Labour blogger cited Wings and another pro independence site whilst defending the presence of BBC material posted on his own site. But this revelation only served to demonstrate that BBC Scotland treated the two possible cases of copyright breach very differently.The Labour politician enjoyed five days of “constructive discussion” with the BBC whilst Stuart Campbell and Peter Curran were simply shut down without notice.All of which has simply exacerbated long-running feelings of discontent amongst independence supporters about bias at Pacific Quay. Meanwhile, a perfect storm was brewing along slightly different lines south of the Border over Radio 4’s news flagship, the Today programme.READ MORE: BBC to review YouTube policy following Wings Over Scotland row            Presenter John Humphreys described Boris Johnson’s controversial burka remarks as “typically colourful language” and concluded “Boris is Boris.” Co-presenter Nick Robinson asked: ‘Isn’t there a danger that if we police every word, we play into the hands of extremists?’Maybe that’s a valid question – but it follows weeks where the BBC has given hours of airtime to a forensic analysis of everything Jeremy Corbyn has ever said about Israel. Fair? Proportionate? Balanced?The same day, official figures showed the Today programme’s lost more than 800,000 listeners this year. The BBC said a “quieter news agenda” was partly to blame. But lecturer and author Tom Mills says it may be because “liberals and leftists have finally given up on the programme”. Just as they (and Scottish independence supporters) have largely given up on another BBC flagship – Question Time. Since it’s off air for the summer recess, the Today programme has suddenly become the biggest target for unhappy English Labour voters – finally sharing the disenchantment with Aunty felt north of the Border since 2012.            One Twitter exchange said it all: “I used to listen to the Today programme every morning but BBC News has become unprofessional, superficial and derivative. It has given up reporting in favour of propaganda and I can’t listen to it any more.”“I’m afraid I recognised that decades ago. I suspect it depends on your class and station. As a working class Scot BBC bias has been evident through my entire life (now 53). It’s taken much longer to be noticed by middle class, southern England – for whom Radio 4 largely exists.” But whoever got there first, last week saw BBC critics unite online.Anger over hounding Jeremy Corbyn whilst gently joshing with Boris Johnson combined with dissatisfaction over the non-coverage of independence rallies across Scotland this summer to produce #BBCswitchoff – a twitter hashtag which trended worldwide on Thursday night. Some BBC weekend news programmes discussed the phenomenon – including Radio Scotland’s consistently probing weekend GMS. But Aunty generally did what it excels at doing – shutting up shop and hoping this latest storm will blow over. Maybe it will.             READ MORE: In pictures: Hundreds protest in Glasgow against ‘BBC bias’But problems slowly gathering for decades are now crying out for discussion and remedy. The biggest is balance – the BBC’s sacred duty. In the old days when Westminster was the only parliament, Labour and Tory the only possible parties of UK government, party politics the main unit of democratic organisation and the great and good the only authorities that mattered, the system just about worked.  But though that old, rigid, London-centric consensus has gone, archaic BBC ideas of “balance” have survived.Not my opinion but that of Gavin Esler – a BBC reporter and presenter for around 20 years. He says: “In the post-Trump, post-Brexit information world, the pillar of journalistic ‘balance’ has cracked. Consider this dilemma. When Donald Trump tells us he never made a statement we have all just heard him make, is it necessary to ‘balance’ [this reality] with a Trump loyalist telling us the president employs ‘alternative facts’? The ‘crisis in our democracy’ comes because maintaining quaint ideas of ‘balance’ in a world filled with ‘systematic disinformation’ is an existential threat.”North of the Border, BBC Scotland has struggled to accept that independence isn’t a “phase,” a single issue where balance matters only during an active referendum campaign. It’s the new most important faultline in Scottish politics and it is “led” not just by party politicians but by bloggers and locally organised groups all over Scotland. That’s why the BBC’s failure to report on local pro indy marches across Scotland, organised by All Under One Banner rather the SNP has not just infuriated Yes voters – it’s been inevitable given Aunty’s rigid understanding of “balance” and who gets to make news. BBC Scotland still refuses to think about who is allowed to “warn” of catastrophes, who is therefore forced to “respond” and what that does to the credibility of each side. Now that English Corbyn supporters are complaining about the same BBC bias towards existing power structures (from which only crazy radicals would deviate), things may be coming to a head. BBC journalists are also unhappy – subject to hostility online yet forbidden from correcting even factual mistakes for fear of escalating Twitter wars. In these circumstances, it’s a terrible shame the BBC lost an excellent broadcaster this week whose popularity with all “sides” has been nothing short of amazing. Over a decade, the talented Scot Eddie Mair and his team on Radio 4’s PM programme perfected the knack of transforming the dry facts and figures of news into fascinating and insightful human stories. The confidence they demonstrated in placing long personal interviews at the top of the programme was breath-taking – yet faced with evasive political figures Eddie was utterly incisive and compelling without being gratuitously rude. Eddie Mair is due to start broadcasting again in September on LBC – which is good news for listeners. But the BBC cannot afford to lose such skilled and inquisitive presenters, when its capacity to reflect the genuine diversity of these islands is being questioned constantly on all sides."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782695.1534147248!/image/image.jpg","title":"richard dixon 50 years of climate change denial","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Fifty years ago, the oil industry already knew that climate change was a threat, yet they carried on regardless. The American Petroleum Institute had commissioned US scientists to look at the consequences of burning fossil fuels. In 1968 those scientists said that carbon dioxide was definitely a concern, that continuing to burn fossil fuels would lead to increases in temperature at the earth’s surface, and that significant temperature increase could lead to melting ice caps, rising seas, and potentially serious environmental damage worldwide.  They said “there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe.”  They said that 50 years ago.            And so began half a century of wilful denial. In the 1970s another oil company, Exxon, spent millions of dollars on newspaper ads trying to cast doubt on climate change.  Meanwhile the company’s own scientists were telling senior executives that climate change is real.             In 1998 Shell’s own scientists wrote an internal report warning that “by the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to stabilise the situation.”Throughout the 1990s the oil companies worked together in the Global Climate Coalition, turning up at the UN climate conferences to try to make sure as little as possible was done to reduce climate pollution.  Since this coalition was discredited, oil companies have continued to fund organisations which deny climate change or lobby against action.Fifty years on from Shell’s start in the North Sea we are seeing the consequences of climate change all around the world.  We’ve just had the warmest and sunniest May-July period ever recorded in Scotland, massive wildfires in the western US and Canada, heatwaves declared national emergencies in Japan and North Korea, and a devastating drought in Australia.  Climate change is killing people and wrecking lives now.  Even if every country in the world does everything it has promised to reduce emissions – a very unlikely prospect - we will still reach a temperature rise twice the so-called safe limit by 2100, four times the temperature rise we have already seen to date.  We know that the world can only afford to burn less than a fifth of known global fossil fuel reserves.Yet Shell carry on as if they can continue to pump oil forever. If we are to have any chance of keeping the planet out of the extreme danger zone the oil companies must transform or die.  Exploring for new oil and gas needs to stop everywhere.  Current jobs in oil and gas need to become jobs in offshore and onshore renewables and energy efficiency.  We can do all this with strong leadership.  And we can do it with or without the oil companies.            Shareholders have challenged Shell to change at recent AGMs and now our sister organisation in the Netherlands is taking them to court to force the company to commit to a business model which helps the world meet the targets in the 2015 Paris Agreement, rather than ensuring we blow the global carbon budget in the next few years.  More than 20,000 people from 70 countries have signed up to support this legal action. The planet cannot afford to have Shell still exist in their current form in even another five years, let alone 50.Dr Richard Dixon is Director of Friends of the Earth Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nMonday 13 Aug 2018 12:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties.

Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27422  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald speaking after meeting with Theresa May.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nIt is now clear that the British Prime Minister has come here to pick a fight with the Ireland to pick a fight with the European Union. - Mary Lou McDonald\nBritish Prime Minster Theresa May came to the north \"to pick a fight\" with Ireland and the EU, Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said today. \nThe Sinn Féin President met Theresa May in Belfast this morning alongside Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill and Conor Murphy. \nThe Tory leader is in the north on a two-day visit to discuss Brexit and other issues. She visited the border in Fermanagh yesterday and made a speech in Belfast\u0027s Waterfront Hall this morning.

That is a nonsense and the British government need to be called out on it. \n\"There is a big responsibility on Taoiseach Leo Vardakar and a responsibility on Michel Barnier and our partners in Europe to stand firm. \n\"The British government need to understand that they can\u0027t simply arrive in Ireland and set out a plan that is so destructive to our interests and expect that there won\u0027t be a mighty reaction to that,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27423  ","story":"Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\nSinn Féin leaders will meet the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier later today to make it clear that the issues of Ireland and the border need to resolved before the next EU summit in October. \nParty President Mary Lou McDonald TD and deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill MLA will meet Mr Barnier in Brussels later today at the headquarters of the EU Commission. \nAt today\u0027s meeting, the pair are expected to tell the EU negotiator that the backstop already agreed between the EU and the British government must be maintained and form part of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. \nThat backstop would see the north remain in the customs union and elements of the single market and would avoid the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. \nThe Sinn Féin leaders will also call on Michel Barnier to ensure the issues of the border and Ireland are resolved ahead of the next planned EU summit in October. \nOne way of doing this would be to hold a special EU summit in September to deal specifically with Irish issues, they are expected to tell he chief negotiator. \nToday\u0027s meeting will be the latest in a series of meetings between Sinn Féin and Michel Barnier both in Brussels and Ireland in recent months. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27424  ","story":"Mary Lou McDonald TD along with Dáil Health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly TD and Assembly spokesperson on Mental Health Órlaithí Flynn MLA in Dublin today.\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The voices of women must be heard when it comes to healthcare.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

\nA county Antrim hotel has opened a bespoke wedding pavilion following a significant expansion project and \u0026pound400,000 of support from Ulster Bank.\n  \nOwners of the Ross Park Hotel, Carmichaels NI Limited, recently carried out extensive refurbishment works which has revamped existing facilities, including the lobby and main function space.\n  \nThe investment by Ulster Bank also supported the creation of a unique wedding pavilion, allowing civil marriage ceremonies to take place in a stand-alone venue at the hotel which is situated on the outskirts of Ballymena.\n  \nWith capacity for up to 120 guests, the wedding pavilion overlooks a wooded area and tranquil gardens, boasts a stained glass window and has many other features designed to create a romantic, peaceful setting.\n  \n The pavilion carries state of the art technology including camera equipment to live-stream your wedding all over the world for any family or friends who may be living overseas.\n  \nDirector of Carmichaels NI Limited, Keith Carmichael, is expecting the wedding pavilion to attract many couples to the Ross Park Hotel.\n  \n“Weddings are a key part of our customer base at the Ross Park , and as such, we wanted to maximise our offering to would-be clients.\n  \nHaving noticed an increase in the number of couples opting for a civil ceremony rather than a church wedding, we decided to add on a purpose-built wedding pavilion away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotel.\n  \n“Thanks to the financial support received from Ulster Bank, the pavilion itself has been finished to an exceptionally high standard and its many unique features make it the perfect location for any couple to tie the knot.”\n  \nAndy Tew, Business Development Manager with Ulster Bank said the bank was pleased to support a project of this nature. “The work at the Ross Park Hotel has been carried out to an exceptionally high standard and we’re proud to have played a role in this upgrade.\n  \n“The enhanced facilities make the Ross Park a very attractive choice for any kind of wedding celebration and will add significant value to the local area.\n  \n“In broader terms, we are seeing huge growth across the local hospitality sector and we at Ulster Bank are keen to work with businesses and help them benefit from this increase in demand.”\n  \nIt is hoped that the wedding pavilion will boost staffing levels at the hotel with owners expecting to create more jobs in the autumn.\n  \nFor more information about the hotel or the wedding pavilion, visit http://www.rosspark/

has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

Only the UK\u0027s largest force, the politan Police, spent more, at £490.8m.\n\nBy contrast, between 2013 and 2018, Police Scotland paid out £106.8m, the third highest amount on overtime.\n\nA BBC investigation has found that overtime spending has now reached its highest level since 2013 as the number of officers continues to fall.\n\nEarlier this year, the Belfast  revealed how the PSNI is spending £125,000 a day on overtime as it struggles to plug gaps in its workforce.\n\nIn the 12 months to last April, a total of £45.5m was spent on overtime here - equivalent to £124,730 a day. Over 1,787,400 hours of extra work were recorded in that time.\n\nLast month PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton urged Secretary of State Karen Bradley to provide assurances that the number of police officers here will be increased to deal with Brexit.\n\nHe believes the post-Brexit workforce should be in the region of 7,000 officers rather than the current 6,600.\n\nPSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said yesterday that due to peaks in demand and the often unpredictable nature of policing, officers are expected to work extra hours in order to keep people safe.\n\nHe commented: \"This may entail working additional hours on top of their normal shifts, rest days and public holidays.\n\n\"As an organisation we seek to manage this in a way that both meets the demands on us and also provides for the welfare of our people.\"\n\nMr Todd continued that spending on overtime had been lower in the 2017/18 financial year.\n\n\"This reflects reduced overtime budgets within overall budget and officer number reductions rather than a reduction in the various demands on policing or the terrorist threat faced by police officers daily as they go about protecting communities,\" he explained.\n\nChairman of the Police Federation, John Apter, said the overtime bill represented the \"hidden reality of policing\" which was not a \"nine to five\" job.\n\nHe also pointed out that officers could not \"just down tools and clock off the moment their shift is due to end\".\n\n\"As such overtime is sometimes inevitable and often compulsory but it should not be used as a crutch to prop up the service enabling it to meet ordinary day to day demand,\" Mr Apter added.\n\nThe Home Office said it was investing £460m into the policing service and had a Police Special Grant scheme through which forces could apply for extra funding when resources were likely to be stretched.\n\nA spokesman added that any decisions around recruitment and resourcing were a matter for chief constables and police crime commissioners.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally.

Why don\u0027t the MoD co-operate with families and the Coroners Office to locate Paras that were involved in the massacre in Ballymurphy?\n\n\"This brutal policy of execution, cover-up and lies carried on over many years.\"\n\nSDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon also offered her support for the Ballymurphy families\u0027 campaign.\n\n\"You are winning the fight,\" she told the event.\n\n\"As we will do today and every day, we stand with you all in your campaigns for truth and justice.\n\n\"As young and old march side by side, as grandparents, parents and children march side by side, the message to the British Government is loud and clear, victims\u0027 issues and pain are intergenerational and while you continue to cover up, families will continue to fight.\"\n\nMs Dillon also urged the public to take part in the current consultation process on establishing the legacy bodies as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement.\n\n\"I would appeal to everyone to engage with the consultation,\" she said. \n\n\"It will be an opportunity to try to shape the legacy mechanisms and to do so based on your life experiences.\n\n\"Every story must be told right across the board.\"\n\nIn 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron apologised for the actions of the members of the Parachute Regiment on Bloody Sunday. \n\nHis apology came after a long-running public inquiry by Lord Saville found the shootings had been unjustified. \n\nThe victims posed no threat, the report found.\n\nHowever the government has rejected calls for a probe on a smaller scale into the events in Ballymurphy.\n\nIt insisted that such an inquiry would not be in the public interest.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

For Julia Hartley-Brewer to play politics with this issue is indefensible then to go on and claim it is some sort of attempt at satire is outrageous.\"\n\n\nBREAKING: \n@jeremycorbyn\n makes statement on the 20th anniversary of the \n#Omagh\n bomb today, paying tribute to the many dead and injured, including the Real IRA bombers who may have snagged a nail while planting the explosives. \npic.twitter/DDMt7ZGlpq\n\n— Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) \nAugust 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe tweet was posted on Sunday, which marked the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bomb. \n\nMemorials took place in the Tyrone town and across the province for the 29 people - including a woman pregnant with twins - who died in the 1998 Real IRA attack. \n\n\n \n\nMan who lost wife in Omagh bombing reveals agony in aftermath of the atrocity - \u0027I feel robbed of the life me and Ann could have had\u0027\n\n\n\n\n \n20 years on, Omagh remembers the 31 lives lost in worst Troubles atrocity\n \n\n\n\nResponding to the tweet many social media users took issue with the use of a picture of the Omagh bomb, and using the event to criticise the Labour leader. \n\nResponding to the tweet, writer of the hit Channel 4 programme Derry Girls Lisa McGee said: \"I cannot believe you thought it was acceptable to use this photograph in this way.\"\n\nSky News Ireland correspondent David Blevins also reacted to the tweet, writing: \"Julia, how long did you spend thinking about the dead and their incredibly dignified families before deciding that the 20th anniversary of Northern Ireland\u0027s worst single atrocity was the stuff of satire?\"\n\n\nJulia, how long did you spend thinking about the dead and their incredibly dignified families before deciding that the 20th anniversary of Northern Ireland\u0027s worst single atrocity was the stuff of satire? \nhttps://t.co/G5wfSAzhwM\n\n— David Blevins (@skydavidblevins) \nAugust 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnother user, who said they were a member of the Labour party, wrote: \"I am from Omagh. I am sick, hurt, and appalled that anyone could make political points out of the destruction of my lovely home town and 29 innocent people who died that day.\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Mrs Hartley-Brewer wrote: \"The fact that some people - even journos - can believe this tweet is true, and not satire, shows just how low our expectations of @jeremycorbyn are. He has repeatedly paid tribute to dead terrorists so why should today be any different?\"\n\nIn the wake of the tweet a fake news story emerged online claiming Mrs Hartley-Brewer had been sacked from her position, Mrs Hartley-Brewer responded to by saying: \"I’m gutted, to be honest. I was looking forward to a lie in tomorrow. But it turns out this is just more Corbynista #fakenews so I guess it’s bedtime for me. Night all!\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u0027s connections links to the republican movement and activity during the Troubles have come under scrutiny since he became Labour party leader in 2015. \n\nThe Labour party and Talk Radio have been contacted for comment. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"irish president to address civil rights festival in derry","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

His officials have confirmed that he will be joining an impressive line-up of speakers and performers who have now committed to attend the Festival,\" the SDLP councillor said.\n\n\"The Mayor’s office is continuing to work along with the festival organisers to secure other contributors from the across the political spectrum on these islands.”\n\nProfessor Paul Arthur, Chair of the Civil Rights Commemoration, said the festival would host a wide range of events.\n\n\"We hope that the programme has begun to address the malign legacy of the Troubles by recognizing that the Civil Rights movement has been an amalgam of the generational, class, gender and ideological struggles that continue to face issues such as spatial segregation, racism, sectarianism and challenges to the LGBT, travelling and migrant communities,\" he said.\n\n“We want to move away from the adversarial debate of ‘them’ and ‘us’ by creating a dialogue of recognition and reciprocity. It is appropriate that we are bringing this together in Derry - the site of that historic event fifty years ago - a truly seminal moment in the struggle for civil rights.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37209027.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Nichola_mallon_ring.jpg","title":"mla loses ring on beach only for it to be found and returned 18","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Strangers even lent a helping hand with a metal detector only for their hunt to end without success. \n\n\"I came home distraught and felt awful ever since,\" she added.\n\n\"I cannot believe that 18 months later a lady would find it, her sister would post it on Facebook and my ring and I reunited. \n\n\"I can never thank Fiona Collins and her sister Amanda enough for finding it and for their honesty.\n\n\"Never Give Up Hope,\" she ended her post with. \n\nSpeaking to the Belfast , the MLA explained how the good fortune was all down to the weather. \n\nThe recent hot spell had burned away reeds leaving the ring to be found.\n\n\"It probably never would have been found only for the weather,\" the MLA added. \n\nBefore leaving the area the family left messages with those that had helped in case the ring showed up and then all of a sudden a text came out of the blue. After a few messages husband Brendan was dispatched back to Ballyliffen to retrieve the ring.\n\n\"We exchanged pictures and a description and even when she said \u0027yes\u0027 I didn\u0027t believe it until it was back on my finger. I never got my hopes up.\"\n\nLast week the Belfast  told the story of how a little boy helped reunite lost wedding and engagement rings with their owners after he was on a treasure hunt in Donegal. Again social media came to the fore to bring a happy ending. \n\n\n \nTreasure hunter Oliver (8) reunites lost engagement and wedding rings with grateful owner\n \n\n\n\"It just shows you to never give up hope,\" added Nichola. \n\n\"You hear these stories and you imagine it could happen to you, but you never believe it - you dream. We never replaced it.\n\n\"I know it\u0027s a engagement ring and they are sentimental to everyone. But I never had a say in picking it, Brendan did it all on his own and we thought it was lost for good.\n\n\"I\u0027m over the moon these things never happen to me.\"\n\nShe added: \"I can\u0027t thank Fiona and Amanda enough. It shows you the power of social media and that there are good honest people out there.\"\n\n\n\n(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]if (d.getElementById(id)) returnjs = d.createElement(s) js.id = idjs.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.1\u0027fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))\n\n\n\nGOOD THINGS DO HAPPEN 18 months ago I lost my engagement ring on the beach at the play park in Ballyliffin.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein to review internal structures after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"treasury drawing up job ad for new bank of england boss as carney heads for exit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Treasury is putting the finishing touches to a job advert for the next Bank of England Governor as it prepares the ground for Mark Carney’s successor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe Canadian is due to step down next June after six years in the role and the Press Association understands that Chancellor Philip Hammond’s team is now working on the final wording of the job description.\n\nThe position will be advertised on the Public Appointments website, with the position likely to demand a in-depth understanding of Britain’s economic predicament in light of Brexit.\n\nThe advert is also expected to feature in a financial publication, having previously run in outlets like The Economist.\n\nCandidates will be asked to send through a full CV and covering letter when applying for the role.\n\nThe posting is expected to be up by the end of September, though a firm date has yet to be set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Bank of England deputy governor Minouche Shafik is among the rumoured candidates to be Mark Carney’s replacement (Philip Toscano/PA)\n\n\n\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: “We will begin recruitment for the next Governor of the Bank of England in due course”, but did not give further details.\n\nMr Carney announced in late 2016 that he would stay in his post until the end of June 2019, opting against a full eight-year term.\n\nIt means he will stay on for three months after Britain formally leaves the European Union in March next year, leaving his successor to navigate the aftermath of the EU divorce.\n\nThe Governor plays a key role in setting monetary policy and regulation, and serves as chairman of the interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, the Financial Policy Committee and Prudential Regulation Committee.\n\nAmong the rumoured contenders are Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Andrew Bailey, as well as Minouche Shafik – a London School of Economics director and former Bank of England deputy governor.\n\nFormer Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan and Ofcom chief executive Sharon White have also been listed as runners and riders, with the latter having previously served as second permanent secretary at the Treasury and a senior economist at the World Bank.\n\nDeputy governor Ben Broadbent is still seen as a potential candidate, despite having been forced to apologise earlier this year after controversially describing the UK economy as “menopausal”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit is expected to feature prominently in the job description (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe language was deemed sexist and ageist, prompting renewed criticism at the Bank’s lack of diversity among its most senior ranks.\n\nBut whoever follows in Mr Carney’s footsteps will be scrutinised for how they navigate the post-Brexit landscape and whether the gradual upward move for interest rates will be maintained.\n\nThe outgoing Governor controversially cut rates to historic lows of 0.25% in August 2016 and launched further monetary stimulus to help stave off an economic slump in the wake of the Brexit vote.\n\nBut with some signs of economic recovery afoot, the Bank’s interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee earlier this month raised interest rates to 0.75%, their highest level in a decade.\n\nThe Bank is currently forecasting that the UK economy will grow by 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020.\n\nMr Carney became the Bank’s Governor in 2013, succeeding Mervyn King and becoming the first non-Briton to hold the post.\n\nHe previously served as Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 and was widely credited with helping the Canadian economy withstand the shock of the financial crisis.\n\nIt followed a stint in the Canadian government, having been senior associate deputy minister of finance and served both Liberal and Conservative administrations, all of which came after a 13-year career with Goldman Sachs.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"elephants in auckland celebrate

The area has been refurbished with a modern new monochrome-themed interior complete with beautiful Amelia Earhart artwork as a tribute to the famous first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. As well as comfortable new seating and tables, free internet access and free view television entertainment, access to complimentary refreshments and a serene view of the beautiful hills of Donegal.\n\nAirport Manager, Charlene Shongo, expressed her delight at the re-opening event: “We are absolutely thrilled that the Amelia Earhart Lounge has been restored, providing an additional space for our passengers to relax. The lounge is ideal for business and leisure customers seeking a quiet space and a little luxury in advance of their flight.\n\n“Access to the lounge is just £10pp and can be booked online on our website and includes complimentary tea/coffee and soft drink, newspapers and magazines and much, much more to enhance the overall airport experience.

He has also managed ‘pacers’ since the 2013 Walled City Marathon 2013 (organised to coincide with ‘City of Culture’ year and the first marathon held in Derry for almost 30 years).\n\n“On race day I will be managing a team of 12 ‘pacers’ said Paddy. “Indeed, our pacing team are experienced runners tasked with completing the course in a specific time – at 15-minute intervals between 1hr 30 and 2hrs 30 for this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n“Holding an even or steady pace throughout a race – as well as combating early adrenaline-fuelled enthusiasm by runners for a fast start – is just one part of the job” says Paddy.\n\n“The pacers are also personal motivators during the race itself. They will help runners along with shouts of encouragement and regular progress updates – and really can make the difference between a disappointing finish to a race and a resounding success.\n\n“Most marathons and half marathons have pacers nowadays” said Paddy. “And they are proving very popular! The Council and organisers of this year’s half marathon are keen to do what they can to improve the experience for runners. Indeed, last year’s participants couldn’t praise the pacers enough for the assistance they provided in helping them to achieve their personal bests (PBs).\n\n“The runners also paid tribute to ‘the craic’ they had with the pacers and for adding so much to the camaraderie of the race itself.”\n\nPaddy says that the pacers in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon will help people to run as evenly as possible or ‘hold an even mile pace’ as he calls it. “If your goal is to finish this year’s half marathon in 2 hours, running with a 2-hour pacer will help you to maintain an average pace of 9 minutes 9 seconds per mile” he said.\n\n“I can’t stress enough how important it is to have pacers at a race. We’re therefore looking forward again this year to help runners get their speed right.\n\n“Following a pacer is also one less thing to worry about – and can really take the pressure off a runner” Paddy says. “On race day there is a lot to think about – from getting there on time to managing hydration or fuel intake during the race. Therefore, runners have enough to be thinking about without also worrying about their pace!”\n\n“Following a pacer will allow you to get your head down, focus on the running and be guided to the finish line in your target time” said Paddy.\n\n“Pacing yourself sensibly during the course of the race – especially amid the excitement and adrenaline of the start – is key to ensuring that it is less of a struggle, particularly for a first-time or beginner” he said. “That’s not to say that it won’t still be a physical challenge – it will – but pacing yourself will help prevent people from struggling or having to stop.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027241829\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“The pacers and the group of runners following the pacer will also offer motivation – giving you something to cling on to or spur you on if you’re struggling to keep up – as they are all in the same boat and will be trying to achieve the same goal. This creates a camaraderie that just can’t be matched by running on your own” Paddy said.\n\n“People also ask ‘How do I pick the right half marathon pacer?’ Choosing which pacer to follow will depend a lot on your training. I would therefore recommend you set a realistic target time, particularly if this is your first half marathon.\n\n“I’d also advise beginners to err on the side of caution. If you want to have a positive experience, don’t set a goal that’s over-stretching yourself. Set a target time that’s challenging but achievable” he said.\n\n\nMeet the pacers\n\n\nDuring this year’s Waterside Half Marathon Paddy will manage 12 pacers in total – 3 pacers for 1hr 30 (Jason Scott, Rodney Agnew and Andy Gray), 2 for 1hr 45 (Darren Madden and Gary Moore), 3 for 2hrs (Gregory O’Brien, Shaun McLaughlin and Paddy McLaughlin), 2 for 2hrs 15 (Stuart Campbell and Andrea Cairns) and 2 for 2hrs 30 (Helena Doran and Claire Martin).\n\nPaddy explains the reason that there are 3 pacers (instead of two) for the 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times is because they’re the most popular in terms of runners who are hoping to achieve a target or beat their personal best (PB).\n\n“The 1hr 30 or ‘90-minute’ finish time is a big hurdle that a lot of runners want to get over.” he said. “The same can also be said of other runners who want to break the 2hr mark.\n\n“We therefore have 3 pacers running in 1hr 30 and 2hr finish times. During the course of the race one of the pacers may drop back a little from the pack to spur on runners who are struggling. Of the two who are left – particularly when it comes to the final stages of the race – one may decide to guide a group of runners to the finish line who are definitely feeling ok and really want to go ‘flat out’ to beat their PB – while the last / remaining pacer will stay with the original group of runners” said Paddy.\n\n“We really want to see as many runners as possible achieve their goals – and it is so rewarding to see them at the finish line having done just that” he said.\n\n“So if you\u0027re planning to take part in this year’s Waterside Half Marathon, I would urge you to join up with one of the pacers before the race begins on Sunday 2 September. Indeed, our team of pacers will be identified by ‘pacer vests’ and coloured balloons corresponding with the finish times. Runners who are taking part in the half marathon will also be encouraged to join the pacers via announcements at the start line on the morning of the race.” \n\nPaddy concluded: “You really will be great hands – and the entire pacing team is hoping to help even more runners this year achieve those all-important PBs!”\n\nEntries to the race close at midnight on Monday 13th August 2018 and you can register online now at \nwww.derrystrabane/whm\n - where you will also find further information on this year’s Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\nPictured above: Last year\u0027s pacers in action preparing for the Waterside Half Marathon.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"president michael d higgins speak derry event marking 50th anniversary civil","story":"\nThe launch of the programme for the international Civil Rights Festival, which will run from 4-7 October 2018, to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, will take place this week, 11am on Thursday 16 August 2018 in the Whitaker Room, Guildhall, Derry.\n\nThe Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor John Boyle, will formally launch the programme together with Professor Paul Arthur, Chair of the 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee.\n\nPresident Michael D Higgins will make a keynote address at the Civil Rights Festival on Saturday 6 October, 2018. \n\nFull details of the programme will be announced at the launch on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the event, Councillor Boyle said: “I can think of no greater honour or privilege in my term as Mayor of Derry and Strabane, than to be launching the 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Festival.

His officials have confirmed that he will be joining an impressive line-up of speakers and performers who have now committed to attend the Festival. The Mayor’s office is continuing to work along with the festival organisers to secure other contributors from the across the political spectrum on these islands.”\n\nProfessor Paul Arthur, Chair of the Civil Rights Commemoration, said: “We have tried to make the Civil Rights Festival in Derry as inclusive and reflective as the times demands. We are aware that in the midst of the Decade of Commemorations (and indeed the eighteenth months of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly) this is the 70th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the 20th Anniversary of the Belfast Agreement. We are aware too that in the context of deeply polarized global politics, creating a climate conducive to human rights is no easy task.\n\n“We hope that the programme has begun to address the malign legacy of the Troubles by recognizing that the Civil Rights movement has been an amalgam of the generational, class, gender and ideological struggles that continue to face issues such as spatial segregation, racism, sectarianism and challenges to the LGBT, travelling and migrant communities.\n\n “We want to move away from the adversarial debate of ‘them’ and ‘us’ by creating a dialogue of recognition and reciprocity. It is appropriate that we are bringing this together in Derry - the site of that historic event fifty years ago - a truly seminal moment in the struggle for civil rights.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"newtown first look for residents at 32m new","story":"\nAt the Mid Wales Housing Association preview event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown, ar\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gte Ffion Jones, aged \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtfive, and three-year-old Trystan Jones and Summer Jones, nine.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143330/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Nathan Pritchard, John Bowen, Dylan Pritchard, Lisa Davies, Madison Pritchard and Keira Davies.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143332/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nFirst look for residents at £3.2m new homes development in Newtown\n\nMid Wales Housing Association Preview Event at Cwrt Cei Coed, Newtown last Wedne\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtsday July 11, 2018.p\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtictured from left, Ffion Jones (5) and Trystan Jones (3) and Summer Jones (9)\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143333/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                                            \n"},{"url":null,"title":"presteigne carnival 2018 sunshine and live music added to the fun at","story":"\nPIC 10: THE Primary School’s Royal Wedding float in all its glory during the P\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtresteigne Carnival d\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtay parade.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143390/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 1: CARNIVAL Queen Sophie Preece after her crowning with attendants Phoebe Ka\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gttsaitis, Menna Baynh\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtam, Mair Thomas and Kameron Traylor.\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143392/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 2: A BIG turnout by the Celtic Dragons Motorbike Club saw them joining the p\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtarade and staging a \u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtstatic display on the Carnival Field before going on to present The Woodchoppers Ball at their headquarters The Woodchoppers Arms in Knighton R\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8143393/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPictures: Sunshine and live music added to the fun at Presteigne Carnival\n\nPIC 3: PUPILS of Presteigne Primary School.
