Regulation 7 deals specifically with the temperature in indoor workplaces and states that: ‘During working hours, the temperature in all workplaces inside buildings shall be reasonable.‘However, the application of the regulation depends on the nature of the workplace, such as a bakery, a cold store, an office, a warehouse.’In addition, the HSE also requires that employers must keep temperatures at comfortable levels for employees and provide ‘clean, fresh air’ for them.How hot does it have to be to go home?Though no official, universal heat limits currently exist, both employees and employers must gauge when action should be taken to prevent serious health risks.‘If a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort, your employer should carry out a risk assessment, and act on the results of that assessment,’ the HSE states.Employees with preexisting medical conditions should also take extra caution in the workplace during heatwaves.In sum, although no universal heat regulations are currently in place in the UK, employees who feel uncomfortable should speak up and tell their managers.

Bridget Reeves, whose grandmother Elsie Devine died in the hospital, said the report showed that Dr Barton had not looked after her patients as she claimedToday she called for action against other medics and managers at the hospital as well as Dr Barton and urged prosecutors to look at corporate manslaughter charges.It comes after a damning report said Dr Barton oversaw a \u0027disregard for human life\u0027 at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, where up to 650 people had their lives cut short by the unnecessary use of strong painkillers and automatic syringe drivers.Although Barton was the focus of criticism, the report was scathing about senior consultants, nurses, pharmacists and managers at the hospital who failed to intervene while she was working there between 1988 and 2000.The four-year, £13 million independent inquiry into the scandal was finally last week – 30 years after the first complaints were made about Barton.The report found a \u0027disregard for human life\u0027 and a \u0027culture of shortening the lives of a large number of patients\u0027 at the Hampshire hospital.          The report said nurses who raised concerns about Dr Barton were told \u0027doctor knows best\u0027It described how patients were given \u0027dangerous doses\u0027 of \u0027hazardous combinations of medication\u0027 when there was no medical justification.Dr Barton, 70, added to the anger of patients\u0027 families by failing to turn up to the publication of the report. She was understood to have been at her holiday home in Menorca, from where she has since returned to £700,000 home not far from the hospital at the centre of the scandal.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/27/10/008D5D9A1000044C-5891179-image-a-20_1530092285682.jpg","title":"Why Meghan Markle no longer eat garlic public Royal","story":"    Now Meghan Markle is a member of Harry’s family, she is banned from eating garlic in publicWhy can Meghan Markle no longer eat garlic in public?As reported in the Express, Meghan Markle is no longer permitted to having foods with garlic when eating abroad at state banquets and events to avoid bad breath.Royal Chef at Buckingham Palace, Darren McGrady, said: ‘We can never serve anything with garlic or too much onions.

Stephen King, currently back in the bestseller lists and seemingly averaging two or three titles a year, declared that he was “done with books” when he ostensibly stropped off back in 2002. Maeve Binchy, another sales banker for publishers, risked ruling out a comeback (“I’m not a Frank Sinatra person”) when she hung up her pen in 2000 after Scarlet Feather, but turned out several more novels.While King and Binchy may have chafed at the book-a-year demands of commercial publishing, exhausted literary novelists are the most frequent non-retiring retirees. Seven years before her Nobel win, Alice Munro, the short story specialist, said she was finished. No less fatigued was Anne Tyler, who said “I want to not ever finish a book again” a year or so before A Spool of Blue Thread came out and was picked for the 2015 Man Booker shortlist.Some authors do indeed stop (Philip Roth, for example) or stop publishing their work while continuing to write (JD Salinger) others definitively cease to produce work in a certain genre – TS Eliot quitting poetry, Herman Melville quitting the novel – and switch to another instead.So many authors in recent years have talked of “last books” that it’s hard to suspend disbelief. Especially quick to un-retire was Jim Crace, who talked repeatedly of looking forward to freedom and of Harvest as his farewell as it advanced towards the Man Booker shortlist (it was the bookies’s favourite), but realised he was wrong to want “a orce from writing”. Perhaps publishers shouldn’t plan a collected Franzen edition just yet.

The\u0026nbspexistence of dangers – from terrorism and cyberwarfare to nuclear proliferation and a pattern of Russian provocations – is beyond question. But to identify a threat is not the same as knowing how to handle it and, since the imagination can always conjure a worst-case scenario, the shopping list of desirable hardware can be long and very expensive.But resources are finite compromise is inevitable. Military chiefs always want bigger budgets, and ministers, keen to show voters that they take no chances with national security, are reluctant to contradict the khaki lobby. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, has gone a step further, noisily demanding cash from the prime minister and the chancellor.Mr Williamson has let it be known that he requires an annual budget uplift of up to £4bn. He has been emboldened to push this case by the recent decision to allocate an extra £20bn to the NHS. If austerity is eased for hospitals – the argument goes – why shouldn’t defence be next in line for largesse?The military has been squeezed since 2010. But it also has a record of wasteful procurement. Philip Hammond knows this better than most since he strived, as David Cameron’s defence secretary, to bring rigour to the system. Now chancellor, Mr Hammond is unimpressed by Mr Williamson’s posturing. He is right to be sceptical. The defence secretary’s short cabinet career has been marked by transparent self-aggrandisement, unsupported by proof of competence.The dilemma at the core of this dispute is not new. It is the latest chapter in the prolonged agony of Britain’s adjustment to its status as a large regional power – a big player by European standards – and not the imperial superpower it collectively remembers once being.There is a hole in the defence budget because the UK has made costly commitments to sustain a self-image as a nation capable of projecting force around the globe. These include renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent and new aircraft carriers complete with new fighter jets to be carried on them. Either the ambition – sometimes described as the maintenance of “tier one” power – must be scaled back or money must be erted from other departments. In reality, the tier one aspiration is a rhetorical prop. The UK will never equal China or the US for military capability. It cannot match Russia or India for volume of weaponry. The UK has some world-class features in its security arsenal – its special forces and intelligence services, for example. But it is not a superpower and should not bankrupt itself pretending to be one.To recognise that limitation is not weakness or defeatism. It takes cultural confidence to reach the hard-headed view of how the nation’s resources can be marshalled to maximise power and influence in the world. Pretending that such choices don’t need making is the backward-looking and cowardly path: one that diminishes security in the long term by dodging necessary strategic analysis.Maintaining the fiction that Britain is a stand-alone military force of global dimensions defers the business of cultivating the best regional security arrangements. It is a symptom of the Brexit delusion: that the UK has no need of Europe and is somehow greater without its neighbours. No outside observer believes that to be the case. Theresa May doesn’t believe it either, which is why she promises an intimate ongoing security partnership with the EU.Austerity has been hard on every public service, including the armed forces. The military is a deserving recipient of adequate funding, especially in a volatile international climate, but its appetite for funding is not so special that it needs no interrogation. The right response to shifting security threats is a strategically focused calibration of priorities and available resources. Posturing by the defence secretary, fuelled by naked personal ambition and tinged with imperial nostalgia, is not conducive to getting a realistic appraisal of what size and military capability most effectively serves the nation and its allies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2ee7711da55ec0f30b86646c06dd542c558efd/435_1054_3384_2029/master/3384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecc4f7a008ffbd129d3bd9adf3dcba04","title":"british museum ivory figures sir victor sassoon","story":"Decision to accept objects from private collection not endorsement of ivory trade, director saysThe British Museum has defended its decision to accept a donation of more than 500 “exquisite” Chinese ivory figures, saying it did not mean it condoned the ivory trade.The museum revealed on Wednesday that it had accepted the gift of 556 ivory items acquired in the early 20th century by Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai-based businessman and hotelier.The intricately carved figures of gods and goddesses, and desk items such as brush-washers and water-droppers, are mostly from the 18th or 19th centuries.Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, said the figures were “exquisite”. “They are of the greatest significance, they are documents of a vast culture and are therefore of the highest cultural value,” he said.The government is steering through parliament a ban on ivory sales that it says will be the strictest in the world. Exemptions in the legislation will allow museums to acquire historic ivory objects that have a cultural value.Asked whether accepting the Sassoon ivory sent the wrong message, Fischer said the museum “fully and unreservedly” supported banning the ivory trade worldwide. He pointed out that the collection was historic: “They exist... and they do not save any elephant’s life today.”The figures have been in the UK since the 1950s and looked after by a trust, whose members were keen to wind down the operation.Fischer said the museum would never collect modern ivory objects and believed there was a consensus that historic ivory objects needed to be preserved, not destroyed.The British Museum has one of the largest collections of ivory in the world, including the Lewis Chessmen and the Nimrud Ivories, artefacts excavated in the Middle East that are nearly 3,000 years old.Jane Portal, head of the museum’s Asia department, said the gift meant the institution could become “a global centre for the study of ivories”.The museum has not revealed the value of the collection. “They may be priceless or almost worthless in the future … who knows,” Portal said.The gift was announced in the British Museum’s annual review, which revealed it was visited by 5.8 million people in 2017-18, making it the UK’s leading visitor attraction for the 11th year running.The figure was down on the previous year’s 6.2 million visitors, but in line with a similar decline at London’s other big museums. This has been blamed on rail problems, fear of terrorism and the expense of London travel and restaurants.Fischer said the museum was working on “offers that will help bring these figures up again”.He said the museum lent a record 2,200 objects to 81 venues outside the UK last year and currently had eight touring shows, including in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong.Strengthening links and activities in Africa would become a priority, Fischer said, as would improving the museum’s Bloomsbury home. “This fantastic building needs some tender loving care so this year we are developing a project to consider how to improve the building for our visitors and our staff and of course our collections.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a77b1d96a6b239b44fa7af4af8c5e004ade607/0_79_1976_1185/master/1976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33499d5f887e270ec93ef3b921cd5fc0","title":"teach primary school pupils about finance say city firms","story":"New initiative set up to test benefits of educating children about money managementLeading City institutions are urging the government to include financial education in the primary school curriculum after a pilot scheme found it helped young people learn to delay gratification and enjoy the benefits of saving.Twenty of the UK’s leading savings and investment firms have set up a financial education initiative called KickStart Money to test the effectiveness of teaching primary school children about money management.The programme uses expert trainers to deliver three 75-minute workshops in primary schools. It aims to help children to understand the value of money, the difference between “needs” as opposed to “wants” and the benefits of saving.The findings will be presented to MPs and peers at Westminster on Thursday where organisers will hope to persuade policymakers that teaching children about money management will lead to a more financially literate generation.According to KickStart behavioural attitudes to money are formed by the age of seven, yet two thirds of parents don’t talk to their children about money and there is currently little financial education in primary schools.Jane Goodland, a responsible business director at the wealth management group Quilter and co-chair of KickStart said: “Politicians may believe that being competent with numbers equates to being good with money.“While basic numeracy skills are helpful for budgeting and saving, many of our financial habits are in fact motivated by our attitudes and behaviours learned at a young age, and not by our ability to do complex maths.”The KickStart programme will reach 18,000 pupils over three years.

We’ve got welfare reform wrong in the past - how can we get it right in the future? “When it came to the crunch the retailers let us down,” says Ian Campbell. When he took over the running of a Norfolk farm in the early 1990s, pig farming was a successful, relatively healthy British sector.But within a few years a government ban on the use of gestation crates, combined with a rise in the value of the pound and a pig meat glut in Europe, would decimate the industry. The number of UK farmers would be nearly halved, while cheap meat from other countries with lower welfare requirements would come flooding in.As a report out this week calls for British farmers to be financially rewarded for high welfare, a vigorous debate is taking place around the future of our standards as we head towards Brexit. Will we hold on to them, and become a beacon for good practice as Michael Gove has promised? Will the need for a trade deal - any trade deal - trump that? Or will we find ourselves in the same place as twenty years ago, holding our own farmers to high standards while shoppers and retailers sneakily buy the cheap stuff? So what happened exactly when gestation crates were banned by our government in 1999? The crates were invented more than 50 years ago as a solution to preventing larger pigs taking food from smaller ones, enabling farmers to keep productivity higher. They became common in the US and Europe from the late 1960s onwards. But they were criticised by welfare groups for preventing the animals from properly moving and carrying out natural behaviours such as rooting. The idea of a ban was first floated in the early 1990s when campaign group Compassion in World Farming persuaded former MP Sir Richard Body to propose legislation to outlaw the practice of keeping pregnant sows in narrow stalls or chains throughout their pregnancies. The bill quickly picked up cross-party support from MPs, forcing the then-Conservative government to act.And to start with it looked like it was all going to be fine. Farmers put money into new facilities, and the big supermarkets started making it a requirement for farmers not to use the crates, remembers Ian Campbell. But with a rise in the value of the pound and a glut of pig meat in Europe, the retailers appeared to forget about the requirement, and began to import cheaper Dutch, Danish and German pig meat, where the animals continued to be confined. “Price was more important, so they didn’t stick with British producers at a time when we really needed them to,” says Campbell, who lost his processor contract as demand for British pig meat fell away. He was forced to sell his slaughtered pigs for half the price on the open market and the owners closed down the unit soon afterwards.It was the start of a “perfect storm” for the pig sector, says Stewart Houston, former chairman of the National Pig Association. Outbreaks of classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease further restricted sales of UK pigs. The ban had also coincided with an end to the practice of feeding meat and bonemeal – ie animal by-products – to omnivores after the BSE crisis in 1996. “It was the right thing to do, as it’s not acceptable to keep sows in stalls, but the problem was that it was done unilaterally,” says the editor of Pig World, Alistair Driver. “The line from the government at the time was that farmers would get a premium from the market for the higher standard.“But this didn’t materialise and what actually happened was that the big retailers continued to quite legally import pig meat from countries still using sow stalls,” he says.Across the rest of the EU, it was not until 2013 that a partial ban on the use of stalls was brought in, although it still allows pigs to be confined to inidual stalls for a further four weeks after being separated from piglets post-weaning. Meanwhile, producers in Brazil, Canada and in many US states are still allowed to keep sows in stalls their whole life.Some argue that pig farmers exaggerate the impact of the sow stall ban. Compassion in World Farming points out that it has benefited the UK sector in the long run by allowing it to position itself as a high-welfare producer. But it too sees the bigger problem. Defra cannot meet its promises to increase animal welfare while still promoting cheap food imports. “If we are going to have better welfare we have to make sure our farmers are not undermined, and be tougher in our trade negotiations post-Brexit,” says CIWF’s chief policy advisor, Peter Stevenson. He points to the example of a new ballot initiative in California that aims to ban the sale in California of pork from herds that use sow stalls.Non-EU member Switzerland also banned farrow crates and tail docking and has costs of production that are double those of neighbouring Germany, France and Austria. But their farmers are protected from imports and given payments for complying with high animal welfare standards.In an ideal world UK supermarkets would promise to only accept pig meat produced to higher standards (so far only the Co-op has done this), says Sandra Edwards, professor emerita at Newcastle University and leading pig welfare specialist. “People don’t want to absorb a detailed argument,” says Edwards. “When consumers are there in the shop and spending their money they don’t realise how their purchases can influence welfare standards. Most rely on retailers to take control. They just don’t want to think about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453355ae1f4bc28fe71b48f635551e9f525ff435/0_89_663_398/master/663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757f0f879c972abdf7b03f9d995b360a","title":"vagabond review agnes vardas sandrine bonnaire","story":"Revived to mark the director’s 90th birthday, the story of a young woman’s short, troubled life is cool, enigmatic and as gripping as any thrillerA young homeless woman is discovered dead in a freezing ditch by an agricultural worker. Pale and still undecomposed, she looks strangely peaceful, as if asleep, and in the mysterious and fractured drama to come, showing flashback episodes in her life descending to this grimly inevitable ending, she is often to be discovered sleeping rough in very much the same situation. As one witness says: “If they’re dead, it’s ugly if they’re asleep, it’s cute.”This is Mona, unforgettably played by Sandrine Bonnaire she has evidently changed her name from Justine, to distance herself from a former wage-slave life as a secretary. She took off on the road to nowhere with her tent on her back, sleeping in fields or roadsides, getting cash-in-hand jobs where she could, sometimes selling sex and sometimes getting raped: always defiant, faintly mutinous, seductive, uncaring, inscrutable. As she says: “Je m’en fous – je bouge” (“I don’t care – I move on”).She is the star of Agnès Varda’s award-winning 1985 film Vagabond, or Sans Toit Ni Loi (No Shelter No Law) now being revived as part of a retrospective in honour of the director’s 90th birthday. This extraordinary film-maker – part of that remarkable and long-lived New Wave generation – is still working, still creating, but this is surely one of her greatest films: enigmatic, possessed of a cool artistry in its structural asymmetries and inconsistencies, and as gripping as any thriller.Varda tells Mona’s story via testimonies of the various people she met: a technique that goes back to Citizen Kane and anticipates Carol Morley’s 2011 documentary Dreams of a Life, about the young woman who died in her London flat without anyone noticing for years. It is a story of someone who has effectively abandoned her identity as well as social status, an outsider, whose existence breaks cover in criminal acts. It reminded me of Rene Allio’s film of Moi, Pierre Rivière … or Cedric Kahn’s Roberto Succo. There is even something Balzacian in the rich spread of characters that Mona encounters.The film pieces together what happened. Sometimes the witnesses speak to an off-camera interviewer just before the relevant scene, sometimes they appear long afterwards, as if to offer an afterthought, and sometimes they will turn in the middle of an encounter with Mona, break the fourth wall and directly address the camera. There appears to be no strict rule or procedural logic in this, and the witnesses seem to have no connection with each other apart from their acquaintance with Mona. But then it appears some of them are related in unexpected ways, a middle-class mesh of prosperity extending horizontally over poor Mona’s head.Wherever she goes, Mona spreads unease. Very often, people secretly envy and admire her and feel discontented with themselves they are jealous of her freedom and think that for all her poverty she is really alive. But not everyone thinks this way. A hippy and his girlfriend take a shine to Mona and give her some land to work and a caravan to live in. But then they are deeply irritated and disappointed when Mona shows no inclination to get out of bed in the morning. This man tells her that, for all the romantic notions, life on the road, with its grinding poverty, is a kind of living death.Perhaps most complicated is Yolande (played by the Belgian character actor Yolande Moreau) who is maid to a rich old lady and whose uncle is the caretaker of her employer’s semi-derelict chateau. Yolande is one evening to discover Mona and a boyfriend asleep in this property, having broken in. She doesn’t inform on them, envying their happiness. They seem to her to be truly in love – in contrast to Yolande’s sullen relationship with her shifty, petty-criminal boyfriend. Yolande is fortuitously to encounter Mona again, and comes to feel very differently about her. Perhaps she can’t make up her mind whether she has an underdog bond with her, or if she is, in her heart, loyal to the ruling class.It is the chronicle of a death foretold. Perhaps the most arrestingly mysterious episode comes when a stylish university academic (Macha Méril) encounters Mona and winds up driving her around, disgusted by her smell and yet also fascinated by her. Later, this same woman is almost electrocuted in a freak accident after she puts both hands on a poorly fitted electric light. Badly shaken, she tells her nephew that she saw her life pass before her eyes. Perhaps, in some strange sense, like the workings of ine grace, it is Mona herself who has electrified this woman, made her take stock of her own existence.And so we watch Mona (or is it Justine?) stumble from place to place, from pointless guy to pointless guy. We have already seen her dead body. It makes her seem like a dead woman walking. But all these people she meets: aren’t they heading the same way? Aren’t they all dead people walking, talking, and training themselves not to think about the future? An unmissable film from this great director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c5ec3c930f10878272ce6bb1f7eec86469a200e/192_302_2873_1723/master/2873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc2ab04020f088a563b1fe27efe85a8b","title":"over and out media reaction to germanys world cup exit","story":"Holders’ exit at group stage was greeted with shock in newspapers around the worldGerman football fans, who had never seen their country fall at the first hurdle of a World Cup finals before, will recognise it as they pick up their papers on Thursday morning.Their team, the holders and one of the pre-tournament favourites, finished bottom of Group F after a 2-0 defeat to South Korea on Wednesday.Germany’s most popular newspaper is “speechless” as it contrasts its front page from June 2014 – after the national team inflicted a 7-1 semi-final defeat on Brazil on its way to winning the World Cup – with its Thursday edition.The headline is the same.

Germany’s defeat by South Korea in Kazan brought great booming cheers around the Spartak Stadium press room and squeals of joy from the Brazil supporters outside.The five-times champions will instead travel east to Samara to play Mexico as Group\u0026nbspE winners. But for all the triumphalism towards the end here, the cheers as the yellow shirts shuttled the ball between some tiring Serbs, there will still be a slight unease around the latest generation to wear that heavy gold shirt.The team’s emotional state had preoccupied the Brazilian press before this game, the canoeing question at Tite’s press conference centred on exactly what degree of crying was acceptable, what were the official team blubbing guidelines.There were no tears here, and indeed Brazil played well in phases. They had a majority hold on possession and looked more nimble in attack, when the ball was shuttled effectively between Philippe Coutinho and the front three. Neymar, who it must be remembered is still finding his fitness under the weight of a World Cup, had more touches than anyone else in the game, managed seven shots at goal and might have scored at least a couple had his finishing been at its most severe.The risible theatrics remain, however. At one point Neymar felt a hand on his shoulder and proceeded to writhe around holding his eye for so long that there was a sudden concern that maybe some invisible skewer flung by a ghostly Russian stadium sprite had indeed penetrated his retina and he was in fact dying before our eyes. But apparently not. He was actually fine.Coutinho looked in wonderfully good order again and set up the opening goal. He has now scored two and made one of Brazil’s five goals in Russia.But between this there were periods where Brazil looked callow and dinky, lacking in presence in central midfield, where Nemanja Matic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic were able to dominate the space. Mexico have already exploited a similar central weakness in the defending champions.The Spartak is a tight ground by the standards of this World Cup, clamped beneath the usual needlessly huge roof, a crown of vast grey tubing swooping around all four sides. Defeat on a muggy night in Moscow would have sent Brazil out at the group stage for the first time since Pelé was kicked around the fields of England, and Serbia through for the first time in their independent history.Brazil were unchanged. Serbia made three, Milos Veljkovic, Nikola Milenkovic and Adem Ljajic coming in. And they were brusque and powerful in the challenge from the start, looking to pile deep crosses in on Brazil’s undersized full-backs.Marcelo left the field early on with a muscular injury, replaced by Filipe Luís. And with 24 slow-burn minutes gone Neymar produced his first little moment of grace, jinking around Milinkovic-Savic with a smattering of fairy steps, then combining with Gabriel Jesus to force a shot.Five minutes later the same combination should have made the opening goal. Neymar whipped a long pass inside Antonio Rukavina. Jesus galloped in on goal and cut inside but saw his right-foot shot blocked.Brazil’s central three began to snap together with a little more urgency as Ljajic was booked for a trip on Neymar that drew a series of gymnastic rolls down the touchline, combined expertly with stricken shriek and waving arm.The opening goal was coming. It duly arrived on 36 minutes, product of another ine intervention from Coutinho, who dropped deep and floated a dream of a pass over the top. Paulinho timed his run perfectly and got a toe to the ball as Vladimir Stojkovic rushed out.Brazil’s players celebrated with a prolonged 10-man huddle. And after the break they should have killed the game early on, Neymar delaying as he ran on to another fine Coutinho pass and allowing Stojkovic to save. For a while Serbia began to assert their midfield strength, helped by the fact Brazil leave that whole area to Casemiro and Paulinho, who were pushed to the fringes at times by the crush of red shirts.On the hour Alisson fumbled a low cross from the right and saw the ball fall just shirt of Aleksandar Mitrovic. And with 68 minutes gone it was 2-0. Mitrovic tried to cling to Miranda at a corner but only succeeded in falling. Behind him Thiago Silva bulleted his header high into the net.The World Cup has been crying out for a statement performance from one of the bigger teams. This wasn’t it from Brazil. But they will march on with some confidence, demons vanquished elsewhere, to face opponents who have yet to score against them in four World Cup meetings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755b9d8f2712a22b97ab15d2c0245bfe5b47bee5/0_57_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8588c70fc10f3669b17e6085c2b6108","title":"south korea germany world cup group f match report","story":"This, then, is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a whimper. There are certain events so apocalyptic that it feels they cannot just happen. They should be signalled beneath thunderous skies as owls catch falcons and horses turn and eat themselves. At the very least there should be a sense of fury, of thwarted effort, of energies exhausted. And yet Germany went out of the World Cup in the first round for the first time in 80 years on a pleasantly sunny afternoon with barely a flicker of resistance. There was no Sturm. There was no Drang.Germany had come to this World Cup not merely as defending champions but also as winners of the last summer’s Confederations Cup – with what was in effect a second string. The overhaul of their academy system was the envy of the world, talent production on an industrial scale. And yet, called upon to score a goal against a disappointing South Korea side who had already lost to Sweden and Mexico, that had lost in qualifying to Qatar and China, they struggled to create a chance.In the end it was VAR that undid them, Kim Young-gwon’s shot that had initially been ruled out for offside given as a goal when it was realised the ball had been played to him by Toni Kroos. And then, even after that, there was a beautiful farce of a goal, Manuel Neuer caught in possession miles upfield as Son Heung-min chased on to Ju Se-jong’s long ball and rolled the ball into an empty net. It was as though football itself was having its joke, the sweeper-keeper who had been such an asset four years ago turned into a liability.Germany are the fourth of the last five world champions to go out in the group phase but this was as limp a defence as any side had managed. There was no defining defeat, as Spain had suffered to the Netherlands, just a whole load of baffling mundanity. There was a chance, three minutes from time, to steal a goal as they had stolen a late winner against Sweden in the second game but, presented with a free header eight yards out, Mats Hummels somehow misjudged his effort to the extent that the ball looped wide off his shoulder.Jogi Löw, the Germany coach, had acknowledged that while the Sweden game was an improvement, his side had still had problems in defensive transition, too often leaving the two central defenders exposed. His solution was to bring Leon Goretzka on to the right of the 4-2-3-1, while restoring Mesut Özil and Sami Khedira, who had both been left out of the win over the Swedes.It gives some indication of the difficulties Germany have had that only three outfielders started all three games. Thomas Müller, who has been struggling for form for a couple of years, was one of the latest sacrifices, the first time he had been left out of a tournament game by Germany since the semi-final of Euro 2012.Neuer has also started all three games despite not having played for Bayern since September, when he fractured a bone in a foot. He has not been his usual assured self either and 19 minutes in, he fumbled a free-kick from Jung Woo-Young before recovering to fist the ball away as Son closed in. To blame him would be absurd, but equally he is clearly far from his best, and in retrospect forcing him back ahead of Marc-André ter-Stegen was perhaps an error.But he was not the only one. Neuer’s uncertainty is part of a far greater whole. The German machine was gummed up here there was no fluency and little cohesion going forward. Perhaps the aim was simply to deny South Korea the counterattacking chances granted to Mexico and Sweden and in that at least, the gameplan was a success. The gegenpressing was more efficient, but then the opponent was weaker, and there was significant cost in terms of attacking threat.Not until Goretzka met a Joshua Kimmich cross with a flicked header three minutes into the second half was there a real sense of German threat. Cho Hyun-woo, though, leapt to his right to claw the ball away. The Daegu FC keeper came into the tournament as third choice before being surprisingly selected for the opening game because he is the tallest of the three keepers and the coach, Shin Tae-yong, was obsessed by Sweden’s height. Cho then gained a cult status in South Korea, where his extravagant ginger bouffant has earned him the nickname “Dae-hair”, taking the Korean word for “great” to create a pun on De Gea.Timo Werner volleyed wide soon after but that was a rare spasm of pressure. With news coming through that Sweden had scored and that Germany therefore needed to score, Löw threw on Mario Gomez and then Müller. Immediately those issues in defending against the counter returned and a more incisive side than South Korea would have taken advantage. It could, in truth, have been much worse, and over much sooner. But for Kroos’s brilliant late goal against Sweden, it would have been over a game ago.In Brazil four years ago Germany struggled to get the balance right between attack and defence until the quarter-final. This time they never quite did and so, inevitably, unresisted, twilight fell upon the gods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0ac841a782b656b375ec6a0eeda62c8794c6c5/0_111_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb912618cc76c48efc432140ad042c9","title":"ticketless fans russia world cup ids","story":"The Football Supporters’ Federation said it hoped a loophole exposed in the Russian security service’s Fan ID system would encourage England fans without tickets to travel to Russia in support of Gareth Southgate’s side.Fan IDs are being given to all supporters who have tickets to World Cup matches to allow them visa-free entry into the country.

Fifa solely provides the ministry with ticket application IDs in an anonymised procedure, thus not sharing any personal data with the ministry.”Authorities in Finland have intercepted a group of migrants with Fan IDs trying to enter the country, apparently after using Russia as a staging point on their journey to the European Union.

Or a Peruvian who sold their house to watch their nation’s first appearance of their lifetime end after only two games.For so long shielded from the full range of emotions that buffet fans of football around the world, like’s the children of Goethe’s Prometheus, finally Germany fans have thrown off their protective coverings to embrace not just joy, but also the full weight of suffering!Yes, the curse of the defending champions has struck once again with Germany becoming the fourth winner of the last five tournaments to crash out during the group stages. Having seemingly found redemption late against Sweden, their final fixture against South Korea was meant to be a near-formality. But Group F provided another day of high drama, as Mexico also capitulated to Sweden in stunning fashion, but nevertheless saw their tournament hopes rescued elsewhere by “the South Korean David De Gea”.And so, with 12 of our knockout teams identified we turn to the final two pairings. It has already become Asia’s most successful tournament (in terms of points accrued) thanks to South Korea’s late heroics - but will Japan go even better than its AFC neighbours and secure progression from Group H against the eliminated Poland? And will Senegal fly the flag for the continent of Africa as it battles Colombia?And of course, the big one (for fans of things that come home). The “both of us will be really trying, this is in no way a race for second” decider between England and Belgium, to see who can finish not first in Group G.It’s another fascinating evening, in a tournament that refuses to not delight and amaze.By now you know the drill, but if you’d like to join our coverage do send us your best thoughts and insights, via email (richard.parkin.casual@the) or twitter (@rrjparkin), or simply comment the below the line.

May has agreed to address the leaders at a dinner on Thursday night after discussions with Donald Tusk, the European council president, earlier this week in Downing Street.She is expected to sketch out her intentions for the coming few weeks before they come to their conclusions on the state of the negotiations the following morning.Asked whether Tusk was more confident about the future following his last meeting with May, a senior EU official laughed, adding: “Well, I don’t think he is less optimistic.”On the so-called backstop solution for the Irish border – a default state to be in place until a free trade deal or bespoke technological solution is agreed – the official said there had “frankly been no progress, and that’s reason to express concern”.He said: “I think that is why they have agreed with Theresa May that it would be useful for the prime minister of the United Kingdom to sketch out the intention of the UK government in the weeks to come.”May is convening a meeting of her cabinet at Chequers on Friday, where she hopes to find agreement among her squabbling ministers on a white paper on the future EU-UK relationship, to be published the following week.One senior diplomat attached to a member state embassy in Brussels said: “We are hoping to hear from her that she is leaving behind her red-lines and bringing forward a credible paper. A credible paper would be something as close as possible to the present situation. The other options are also credible but they are not very nice.“Some of the red lines that have been in her speeches have made it very difficult to come to a trading relationship close to the present situation.”Spain has also expressed its concern that an agreement has yet to be struck with the UK over the future of Gibraltar. However the failure of the UK to live up to its promise in the December joint report on a solution to the Irish border remains the issue most likely to upend the talks.Arriving in Brussels, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, described the lack of progress as “very disappointing”, and that Dublin was intensifying work on its contingency plans. “I expect EU leaders to send a strong message to the UK that negotiations … need to intensify. Preparations and contingency planning continue in Ireland and are intensifying for all outcomes.” A French government source said they were preparing for all scenarios, but that Friday’s message was serious. This is the last summit before October when, theoretically at least, the withdrawal treaty should be decided. If not, it will be a big problem, the source said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38db0ea295c9c0a8f0b6ccd01b44023124d2f04/0_12_1808_1085/master/1808.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=042e2269064f8b0d163b403d83a1c0b5","title":"theresa may eu brexit cabinet split brussels","story":"Prime minister travels to Brussels after a week of very public cabinet disunityTheresa May will seek to paper over the cracks in her warring cabinet and insist the government is making progress on Brexit when she updates EU leaders over dinner in Brussels on Thursday.The prime minister will be given a brief opportunity to address her EU counterparts at a summit that was until recently billed as a make-or-break moment on the road to Brexit.A senior government source said there would be no discussion before EU leaders turned their attention to the migration crisis and eurozone reform. “We wouldn’t expect a debate on it,” he said.Instead, leaders are likely to ratchet up the pressure on Britain to make a choice about the future relationship it wants with the EU.At Thursday’s summit, which the remaining 27 EU members will continue on Friday once May has left, the prime minister will seek to underline the UK’s continued commitment to its EU partners after Brexit.“The PM will re-emphasise the UK’s commitment to working with the EU to address the common challenge posed by illegal migration now and after the UK leaves the EU,” a senior government source said.The prime minister travels to Brussels after a week of very public cabinet disunity, including over whether the aerospace company Airbus was right to warn of the risks of a no-deal Brexit.Jeremy Hunt described Airbus’s statement as “completely inappropriate”, while the business secretary, Greg Clark, defended the firm’s right to contribute to the Brexit debate.The former chancellor George Osborne waded into the row on Wednesday, telling business leaders at a private CBI lunch: “I know it’s not easy to raise your head above the parapet. But do speak out and make yourself heard … Your actual experience needs to be heard in this debate”.Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, repeatedly mocked the cabinet splits and indecision at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, saying May was putting jobs at risk.With less than a month before parliament breaks up for the summer recess, Downing Street is preparing a fresh push to unite ministers around a Brexit negotiating position, which will be fleshed out in a white paper expected to run to more than 130 pages.Whitehall sources say May is increasingly leaning towards a Norway-style approach, that would involve accepting single market membership, at least for goods, while Brexiters are continuing to push for a much looser, Canada-type trade deal.Anand Menon, director of UK in a Changing Europe, said the government was slowly realising that its hopes for a bespoke relationship are unrealistic – particularly with time so short. However, both of the options left on the table are deeply problematic for the prime minister.May would also have to sell it to the EU. Brussels is adamant the single market is inisible, and membership for some sectors would be “cherrypicking”.But senior negotiators believe they have picked up more positive signals from EU governments keen to avoid trade disruption. May will meet a series of EU27 leaders in the next seven days, beginning on the sidelines of the European council in Brussels, to seek to win them over.Domestically, Clark is increasingly becoming the champion of the softest possible Brexit. He has recently visited the Irish border and the NorwaySweden border to understand the risks for trade. “He’s seen it it in real life and he’s been affected by what he saw,” said a source close to the business secretary.A senior Tory source said: “He’s accepted the fact that we’re leaving the single market and the customs union. He accepts that’s the political and legal statement we have to make and that’s the starting point. We’re trying to find ways of minimising disruption – linguistic ways of protecting vestiges of seamless movement for example, for the movement of parts for planes. It’s a very fine linguistic tightrope, as well as a political one.”Both options for future customs arrangements – including the Brexiters’ favoured “max fac” approach – are expected to appear in the white paper.Brexiters say they are relaxed about drafts of the paper already circulating in Whitehall. “There isn’t a white paper as such,” said a senior government source. “There’s lots of drafts and comments on drafts, and they can change until the last possible moment”.May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, uses an article in Thursday’s Daily  to urge her to take a more robust line with Brussels, and step up no-deal planning.“The time for playing nice and being exploited is over,” he said, warning against any deal that would require the government to accept continued freedom of movement.May’s decision to summon the entire cabinet to Chequers, not just her deadlocked Brexit subcommittee, is causing anxiety among leavers. “They’re stacking the deck to make sure they’ve got the numbers in the room,” said one senior government Brexiter.At Thursday’s summit, expected to be dominated by the migration issue, May will also urge the EU to work closely with the UK on security, including by coordinating responses to Russia and other hostile states.She will urge her colleagues to roll over the sanctions against Russia introduced after the conflict in Crimea and to share the names of the Russian diplomats expelled after the Skripal poisoning, so that they are not readmitted to other EU countries."},{"url":null,"title":"scientists develop thermal camouflage that can fool infrared cameras","story":"Invention can make an object appear to have the same temperature as its backgroundScientists have developed a thin, lightweight and flexible film that can outfox infrared cameras, allowing hot bodies to appear cool and cold items to appear warm. The invention can also help camouflage an object by making it appear the same temperature as its background.The design was inspired by the colour-shifting capabilities of cuttlefish, says Coskun Kocabas, a co-author of the research from the University of Manchester.The approach involves using electricity to alter the properties of the film, so that it changes from acting more like a “black body” – which absorbs and emits electromagnetic radiation but does not reflect it – to becoming more like a metal, which reflects radiation but is not good at absorbing or emitting it.Kocabas said the film could have a number of uses. “One obvious application is of course camouflage, but the novelty in this is it is adaptive camouflage,” he said, adding it could also be useful for covering radiators on satellites, allowing them to be tweaked to reflect heat when facing the sun and emit excess heat when facing deep space.Writing in the journal Nano Letters, Kocabas and colleagues in the US and Turkey reveal how they created the material using a stack made of nylon, gold, polyethylene soaked in a liquid composed of charged molecules, and multiple layers of graphene.Graphene, a honeycomb sheet of carbon one atom thick that has been dubbed a “wonder material”, is very good at emitting heat in the form of radiation. As a result, when the device is rested on a person’s hand, the heat it gains from the hand is emitted as infrared light, meaning that when a thermal camera is pointed at the device, an image of the person’s hand can be seen.But there’s a twist. The team found that when a voltage was applied across the device, the charged molecules in the polyethylene layer became incorporated within the graphene layers. That, they found, reduced the level of infrared light the graphene could emit.As a result, when the team applied three volts to the device, the image of the person’s hand could no longer be seen when the device was viewed through the infrared camera. The team then set up a sensor to measure the changing temperature of a surface, and used that information, via an algorithm, to adjust the voltage applied to the device – which itself was kept at a constant temperature.As a result, they were able to change the apparent warmth of the device as seen through an infrared camera, allowing it thermally blend into the surface in less than five seconds, even though its actual temperature did not change. The team say the system can currently work between temperatures of 25C and 38C.Further work revealed that incorporation of the charged molecules into the graphene doesn’t just affect the device’s ability to emit infrared light – it also changes how reflective the device is.The team found when the device itself is kept at a temperature hotter than its surroundings, increasing the voltage decreases the apparent temperature of the device. That is because the device is now less able to emit infrared light and, although it is now more reflective, there is little infrared light to reflect. However, Kocabas said, when the device is kept cooler than the surroundings and a voltage is applied, the device appears warmer than it really is because there is now more infrared light to reflect from its surroundings.

The Australian-Turkish team discovered more than expected: 10 billion trillion trillion tonnes of gloop, or enough for 40 trillion trillion trillion packs of butter.Prof Tim Schmidt, a chemist at the University of New South Wales, Sydney and co-author of the study, said that the windscreen of a future spaceship travelling through interstellar space might be expected to get a sticky coating. “Amongst other stuff it’ll run into is interstellar dust, which is partly grease, partly soot and partly silicates like sand,” he said, adding that the grease is swept away within our own solar system by the solar wind.The findings bring scientists closer to figuring out the total amount of carbon in interstellar space, which fuels the formation of stars, planets and is essential for life. Until now there has been uncertainty over how much carbon is drifting between the stars. About half is expected to be found in its pure form. The rest is chemically bound with hydrogen in either a grease-like form, known as aliphatic carbon, or as a gaseous version of naphthalene, the main chemical component of mothballs.To tackle the question, Schmidt and colleagues recreated in the laboratory the process by which greasy carbon forms in the outflows of carbon stars. The material was collected and analysed using spectroscopy to work out how strongly it absorbed light of certain wavelengths. “This allowed us to figure out how much greasy carbon is in the line of sight of various stars,” said Schmidt.They found that there are about 100 greasy carbon atoms for every million hydrogen atoms, accounting for between a quarter and a half of the available carbon in the Milky Way.“This space grease is not the kind of thing you’d want to spread on a slice of toast,” said Schmidt. “It’s dirty, likely toxic and only forms in the environment of interstellar space – and our laboratory.”The team now plans to determine the abundance of the mothball-like carbon, which will involve more laboratory experiments. By firmly establishing the amount of each type of carbon in the dust, they will know precisely how much of this element is available to create life. “It’s part of understanding the great life-cycle of carbon,” said Schmidt. “It’s made in stars, goes through the interstellar medium and gets incorporated into new planetary systems and has ended up incorporated into life. It’s part of the big story, the biggest story there is.”Helen Fraser, a senior lecturer in astronomy at the Open University, said: “It remains a major question in astronomy how dust forms, evolves and is destroyed.”Fraser said the work suggests that are many more “grease-like” molecules in space than previously thought. “The consequence could be important in how such dust grains stick and form planets, or even ‘seed’ planetary surfaces with the ingredients for the origins of life,” she added.The findings were published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fab14f175ebdf5d3f8cf66fc2fd2560703a30aeb/0_131_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411a5c510326fc2f5370de31bff99f0d","title":"england australia twenty20 international match report","story":"Australia will depart these shores with six defeats from six to show for their efforts after a one-off Twenty20 match in which England reproduced the dominance of the whitewashed one-day-series in microcosm.Indeed the faces they will see when eyes are shut at night remain the same from the 5-0 hammering, with Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid continuing their form here in a relatively straightforward 28-run victory for Eoin Morgan’s side at the stronghold of Edgbaston.Buttler’s 30-ball 61 – including England’s fastest half-century in the format from 22 balls – was the rocket-fuelled start to a total of 221 for five, their highest ever at home, and an instant return on the decision to the push the wicketkeeper up to open.Rashid’s three for 27 in the reply, including Aaron Finch for 81 when the opener was threatening a fightback, then saw the tourists bowled out for 193 with two balls to spare. Chris Jordan, not in the 50-over squad but trying to stake a claim, picked up three wickets as well.This was cracking day in sunny south Birmingham. The bars had been open all afternoon and, as was the case in all five of the one-dayers, Australia won the toss. Chasing may be all the rage in T20 but Finch’s decision echoed that by Tim Paine before the world-record total at Trent Bridge with the ropes in and the pitch flat, England were not going to say no.And sure enough a 98-run opening stand from only 8.5 overs followed, first led by Jason Roy piercing the infield three times in Billy Stanlake’s initial over before Buttler began raining down blows – six fours and five sixes to be precise – to get Australia reeling early.Kane Richardson will not forget his day either. Taken for 23 in his first over (amid figures of none for 59), he then grassed a simple catch at long-on to give Roy a life on 27. Edgbaston still enjoys an Australian in strife, as shown when Buttler chipped Ashton Agar’s next ball over the fast bowler’s head for four.Mitchell Swepson copped some too, when a wild throw went for four overthrows, but the leg-spinner did have some joy on debut, getting Buttler in the ninth over and Morgan, a surprise No\u0026nbsp3, in the 12th via catches in the deep. With Stanlake inflicting revenge on Roy – a searing bouncer was top-edged on 44 – England sat 132 for three with 50 balls to go.Up stepped Alex Hales, batting lower than opener for the first time in his 53 T20s, striking five fours – either deftly guided, slashed or swept – and two sixes, over long-on, in a 24-ball 49 before becoming the victim of a fine return catch by Marcus Stoinis in the 19th over. He and Joe Root had kept up the momentum with a fourth-wicket stand of 72 but though the Test captain himself struck 35 from 24, the sight of Jonny Bairstow clubbing two sixes – one first ball and another to end the innings – suggested he was probably the man for No\u0026nbsp5 on this surface.With such a total on the board, the reply needed a strong start. But while Finch eventually fired, he was shorn of the strike early on as D’Arcy Short and Glenn Maxwell fell early in the piece, the latter thanks to a fine slower-ball cutter from Jordan. With Australia 59 for two from the powerplay, Morgan turned to his spin twins. Moeen Ali removed Travis Head, caught on the boundary, and Rashid picked up Alex Carey and Stoinis to suck the life out of the chase.Though Finch took to Moeen thereafter amid a blistering assault, Rashid’s return in the 16th over had him caught on the rope attempting a seventh six. That may have been effectively game over but there was one more cheer of derision for poor Richardson: out for a golden duck amid a two in two balls for the impressive Jordan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc20960f8957285e3acdfb0626861579e427d767/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25636af9a9c1db1a371950f3ede0eb70","title":"irelands ancient east experience its beauty on a budget","story":"With burial mounds dating back to 3,200BC, medieval castles, and centuries-old pubs, the east of Ireland is brimming with history. But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries. Services run between Holyhead and Dublin and Pembroke and Rosslare, with up to eight sailings per day – taking either two hours (the Dublin Swift) or 3 hours 15 (cruise ferry crossing).

Were her fears justified?I think the first time I became concerned about my trip to Haiti was on the connecting flight from Miami. A woman on the plane, who I assume had spotted I was an outsider, asked me why I was going there. I have learned not to say that I’m doing a TV show, because that immediately leads to more questions than you get at immigration control, so I told her it was for a holiday. At that point, she became extremely animated, asking me if I knew how dangerous it was.I was with one of the producers of my new show, in which I go on holiday to places I wouldn’t usually visit. Just as we were beginning to feel genuine concern for our own wellbeing, the woman asked where we were staying and, on hearing the answer, looked horrified. She told us not to leave the hotel grounds after dark. I didn’t know what I was more frightened of: Haiti or this woman.Such a conversation cannot help but put you on edge. The sights of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, do little to dull that. As we drove from the airport to the hotel, which was definitely in a dangerous area, we were confronted with a combination of poverty, overcrowding and the aftermath of an earthquake that could have taken place months ago rather than years. What added to all of this was the enormous collection of voodoo statues (or Vodou, as it’s spelled in Haiti) that adorned the hotel gardens. I have to be honest: while it is nice to see cultural adornments, the combination of jet lag, scary woman on plane and arresting city visuals meant that I found the voodoo imagery particularly freaky. This is, of course, all down to cultural ignorance on my part. But it was still freaky. I would have killed to see a gnome.I was still frazzled when I went to bed that night. My room was a little walk away from the main hotel building and, as I was walking over to it, a dog came running out of the bushes and starting barking at me. I immediately turned around and headed back to the hotel. I say headed, but I obviously sprinted. I then turned back and the dog was gone. I waited a few minutes and went back out, whereupon I was once again chased by the bush dog. I repeated this process five times, as if I thought the dog might only have five chases in him. I then spent some time sitting in the lobby of the hotel, thinking about just sleeping there and wondering if dogs can actually live in bushes. All of this was strongly contributing to the opinion I was forming that Haiti was very much not for me. After about half an hour of this misery, I decided to give it one last try. I don’t know whether the dog had fallen asleep, or if it had seen me crying in the lobby, but I made it to my room. Which had loads more voodoo stuff in it. I was keen to explore voodoo while I was there, as I was pretty sure that relying on what I’d seen in Live and Let Die and various horror films had probably skewed my view. I asked if I could be cured of my anxiety, whereupon I was sent to pick up some items from a voodoo market. I was required to purchase a series of items that I would give to the voodoo priest in order to complete the ceremony. The list was baffling. I had to buy deodorants and colognes, which essentially meant that any airport duty free is a great voodoo stop-off. In addition to this I was required to buy powders with names like “leave me alone powder” and “go over there powder”. I seem like I’m being cynical, and I am, but mainly because I was being shown around by a man called Reggie whose stall, by coincidence, stocked all of the items I required.It’s difficult visiting somewhere like Haiti and – in particular – Port-au-Prince. The fact is that it is not particularly pleasant to spend time there. We were taken to Cité Soleil, the most poverty-stricken area of the capital. It had all the textbook items you would look for in a poverty safari: children wearing nothing, awful sanitation and rickety accommodation. Cité Soleil has the added factor of absolutely no police, which means that gun crime is rife and kidnappings happen. I wasn’t particularly keen on going, but not just for the obvious reasons. I wasn’t sure I wanted to wander round peering at these people, stroking my chin and talking about what a shame it all was. In fact, the only reason we went was because I was told it was safe and one of the locals was keen to show us around and prove its reputation wasn’t warranted. Its reputation is fully warranted. Yvon, our guide, told us that everyone there would know I was with him and there would be no issues. What in fact happened was that men with guns would see us walk by, shout something at Yvon, who would cower and say something timid back, then try to convince me they were talking about the weather. It was in Cité Soleil that I discovered a bizarre Haitian tradition to do with dominoes. Every time you lose a game you have to attach a clothes peg to your body. The initial peg doesn’t hurt so much, but if you rack up a few losses the cumulative pain of loads of clothes pegs is apparently horrific. Plus you then have no way of drying your clothes. I imagine if you haven’t a lot of money, pegs are a way of keeping a gambling element involved in difficult circumstances. That type of chin-strokey sentence is exactly why I didn’t want to visit Cité Soleil. I heard a lot of raboday during my time in Haiti. This is a relatively new form of music, which probably sounds closest to reggaeton. If you don’t know what that is, I guess raboday’s closest British equivalent would be grime. If you don’t know what that is, then read another article, grandad. The biggest star of raboday is a guy called Marinad 007, whose song Madan Papa was playing everywhere. I was reliably informed that it is about sugar daddies. I say reliably informed, because we were lucky enough to meet Marinad and he displayed the classic rapper traits of being hugely eloquent in his songs and borderline mute in conversation. While my time in Port-au-Prince was challenging, it would be remiss not to mention how beautiful other parts of the country are. I spent some time in Jacmel on the southern coast, with its beautiful beaches and touristy hotels. It’s probably the first time I remembered that we were next door to the Dominican Republic, where everybody goes on holiday. I was making a TV show, however, so I was not allowed to spend time on the beach. I was taken to Bassin Bleu, a series of three freshwater pools you can swim in and jump into from cliffs. I was presented with two jumps and was told that I would be attempting the higher of the two. The director said it was totally up to me whether I jumped or not, but that they didn’t have an ending for the Bassin Bleu bit of the show if I didn’t. What I was not told was that, once you climb up, it is probably just as dangerous to climb back down as to jump. I will leave you to watch the show to see what happened. (I jumped and survived. You don’t have to watch.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e13d2d779d4803c6b8c14a8148f4d284a7ffe97d/192_77_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc45facd859dc47b9a8111c56b0171dd","title":"stath lets flats review finding the funny in generation rents plight","story":"Well he – Stath – tries to, anyway. Tries to let flats. The trouble is, he’s not very good at it. Sharp-suited but dim-witted, incompetent and inappropriate. In short: a bit of a dick. “Oh blimey, there’s a man in the bath, I can see his willy,” he says to a couple he’s showing around a property, quickly closing the bathroom door. “Hahaha, just joking, it’s a lovely flat, there’s no willies,” he says, opening the door again.We are introduced to Stath (played by the show’s creator, Jamie Demetriou) in a montage of showings. He arrives late in the company car, which he parks badly outside some disgusting, pokey, damp, dark, basement that is on for about double a nurse’s monthly pay (this is London). “I’m Stath,” he says, offering an awkward hand to potential tenants – awkward because the upper part of the arm is also being used to hold the property details against Stath’s side, he’s got his phone in the other hand.“I’m Stath,” he says. Sometimes it’s “many happy returns”, not because it’s their birthday, just for a little joke, you know, to break the ice. Always “I’m an idiot”, although he says this without actually saying it, just through everything he does. And perhaps also “I’m a sitcom trope”. The loud, UPPER-CASE IMBECILE, lacking in self-awareness, although not entirely unlovable ... What is that cool wind sending a shiver through you suddenly? Is it the “airiness” (Storm Hector, practically) coming under the badly fitted door of the flat Stath is showing you around and wants £1,750 pcm for? Or is it the ghost of David Brent passing, 17 years on?The situation is fresh, at least – not so much the estate agent part of it, and the tosser-typers therein, but north London’s Greek-Cypriot community. In the office of Michael \u0026amp Eagle, which may not be a million miles from Haringay thoroughfare Green Lanes, dad Vasos is getting on a bit, wanting to retire to spend more time on the iPad, and needs to pass on the empire. It’s King Lear, north-London-style, but with gags.Trouble is, the choice of heirs is Stath, or his sister Sophie (played by his real-life sister, Natasia Demetriou) who is no less of an idiot. A different kind of idiot, though: quieter, less annoying, just a bit dumb – she’s lost when at the bus stop on the other side of the road from the office. It is a lovely performance. Lovely performances and character creation from both of them, and there is – unsurprisingly – a genuine relationship between them. (At this point Stath would probably say something inappropriate.) What must it have been like in the Demetriou household, with two wannabe standupcomic actors? Wannabe and gonnabe. Amusing and entertaining, I imagine.Sophie is less interested in managing the business, more interested – weirdly – in Al (Alastair Roberts) in the office. But then Al is whacked in the face by a spinning flipchart, spun by Stath, of course, and Sophie tries to take him to the hospital, although what she thought was a hospital (because it was a big building) turns out to be just that, a big building, an office.Slapstick plays a big part in SLF. There’s also a pigeon on the loose in the loft of one Michael \u0026amp Eagle property, which ends up, inevitably, with pigeon v Stath and three smashed tellies. Nice performance from the pigeon, too.Meanwhile, next door is a posher, more English estate agent. It could be Foxtons, but it’s actually called Smethwicks, with whom Vasos has an ongoing wheelie-bin feud. The tall, blond, arrogant Smethwicks agent, looks down disdainfully on his neighbours. Is his smile sneerier still since 23 June 2016, I wonder?Brexit and Windrush, too, perhaps, add a little piquancy to Stath Lets Flats, the well-established immigrant community feeling a little less secure. And it’s an honest, fond, insider’s look at that community. Plus, it’s a pretty accurate portrait of the capital’s ongoing housing crisis, where no amount of agent bullshit can hide the fact that a horrid hole costs stupid money.Those – along with the characters and performances – are the ticks, the “it’s not too far to the tube”, and “it has a nice feel to it”. Nice observations in the writing, too, especially some of the less obvious ones, such as Al saying “Fine thanks, yep, how you doing?” to Sophie, even though she didn’t ask him how he was and had just said “Hiya”.But then there’s the damp – the fact it only goes somewhere new geographically, rather comedically. And the pokiness – the heavy reliance on physical comedy.“Do you want to take it?” asks Stath, and then again, a bit more agressively. Er … no, I need another viewing, next week, before signing anything, OK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db7eec180e23ee87d4065da29990a7d09f4406d/0_118_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf5c8aaf3a42cac067836532dac456a8","title":"john bolton vladimir putin moscow visit us russia","story":"Russian presidential aide says location of meeting will not be in the US or Russia, after meeting between Putin and John BoltonDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin have agreed a time and place to hold their first official summit, a senior Russian official announced on Wednesday.The Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told journalists that the summit will be held in a country other than Russia or the United States. The date and location of the meeting will be announced on Thursday, Ushakov said.The announcement followed a one-on-one meeting between the US national security adviser, John Bolton, and Putin at the Kremlin on Wednesday, where the two sides discussed the summit, nuclear arms control and other bilateral issues, according to the Russian side.Bolton confirmed that the meeting would take place and said Moscow and Washington would announce the details “simultaneously”. The summit will be the two leaders’ first encounter since they met at the G20 summit in July 2017.In Washington, Trump suggested Vienna or Helsinki as possible venues. He told reporters that he had watched the Bolton-Putin interview on television but had yet to receive a “full report”.“It would look like we will probably be meeting in the not too distant future and I’ve said it from day one getting along with Russia and China and with everybody is a very good thing,” the president said in the Oval Office.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday evening, Bolton defended the meeting, saying: “I don’t think it’s unusual for the leaders of Russia and the US to meet,” he said.Trump and Putin “think now is the time for them to get together”, Bolton said. “Direct communications between Trump and Putin is in the best interests of the United States.”Asked about what the summit could achieve he said he was not sure anything concrete would follow. The “fact of the summit is a deliverable”, he said.Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, did not veer widely from stated US policy. He said US policy had not changed on sanctions imposed after Russia seized Crimea, and, asked about Moscow’s interference in US elections, said: “I think Trump is going to raise the full range of issues between Russia and the United States, absolutely.”Asked whether the US would recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea, he said: “That is not the position of the United States.”Bolton, accompanied by the US ambassador to Moscow, Jon Huntsman, also met the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and an adviser, Yuri Ushakov, whose portfolio includes US policy.“I have to say with regret that Russian-American relations are not in the best shape,” Putin told Bolton, “and I’ve already said this repeatedly in public and am saying this to you now: I think that this is largely a result of the acute internal political struggle within the US itself.”He added: “Your arrival in Moscow has given us hope that we can make the first steps to reviving full relations between our governments.”Russia has said it is open to a summit between Putin and Trump, and it has been reported that White House and Kremlin officials have met in recent months to make preparations. Vienna and Helsinki have been suggested as potential venues for the meeting.The two sides have been at odds over issues including Russia’s alleged interference in the 2016 US election, the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, cybersecurity, Nato policy and nuclear weapons. Relations between the two countries are widely seen as being at their worst since the cold war.Bolton has previously called for a tougher US stance against Iran, North Korea and Russia. But Trump has charted a course more favourable to Putin, defying a US foreign policy establishment that has widely condemned Russia for allegedly hacking US political parties and spreading disinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign.Russia and the US have closed consulates and expelled hundreds of diplomats in tit-for-tat actions during the diplomatic fallout.Trump and Putin met twice at a G20 meeting Hamburg last year, and had a discussion over dinner with only a Russian translator also present. Trump said the leaders discussed adoption policy.Expectations for any summit between Putin and Trump are modest, especially as meaningful sanctions relief for Russia would require the consent of the US Congress.Speaking to a Senate committee on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo said: “The president is looking forward to an opportunity to find those handful of places where we can have productive conversations that lead to improvements for each of our two countries.“I think we have our eyes wide open that that space is pretty small,” Pompeo added. “They don’t share our values in the same way the European countries do. But I think the president is hopeful we can reduce the temperature and reduce the risk for America.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab0161c42e7340c7e7a738548deda0e8b45fb75/0_270_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee088ea01eef6eff1c5cff14b610572","title":"yangtze at 100km intervals a photo essay","story":"Mother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraMother River is a four-year project for which the British-Chinese photographer Yan Wang Preston photographed the 6,211km Yangtze river at precise 100km intervals with a large-format film cameraThe Yangtze river is usually celebrated by idealistic images of iconic places. But with Mother River, Yan Wang Preston wanted to undermine the deep-seated preference towards certain river places and their landscape representations. By selecting photographic sites at equally spaced locations, she did not necessarily produce a picturesque view. Instead, the project is filled with random landscapes that have rarely been photographed before. The project aims to tell a story of the entire width of China from its western highland to its eastern coast and demonstrates that in an era of abundant satellite mapping and saturated imagery, fresh views can still be created by a simple mapping exercise.“In modern China though, it is the Yangtze that has been promoted by the central government as the main national icon. This is to do with the Yangtze’s importance for China’s development. It provides the most important trade route into the wealthiest area of China. It is the physical and metaphorical frontline of China’s modernisation, with over 30 hydroelectric dams planned or constructed on it. It provides an analogy for China’s political unification as it is the longest river in China which ‘connects’ all the regions from Tibet to Shanghai. For all these reasons the Yangtze is in focus, and that’s why I wanted to work on it.”“My journey began at 5,400m above sea level in the uninhabited zone known as the Tibetan Plateau. From here, the Yangtze river flows through majestic mountains with almost no access at all, before hitting the industrial lowland near Shanghai.”“Inhospitable terrain and huge distances made this project a modern-day adventure, with many potential hazards including high-altitude sickness, off-road driving, floods, sandstorms, earthquakes, landslides and mudslides.”“Not surprisingly, the process of realising the Mother River project wasn’t without incident. Two locations (Y15 \u0026amp Y16) remain unreached to this day, while 24 locations (Y39 - Y62) were originally depicted in poorly exposed images, because I loaded the films back-to-front by mistake. (I decided to re-shoot afterwards). It is precisely these imperfections that testify to the physicality of this highly conceptual project, and which also give it a particularly ‘human’ touch.”Yan Wang Preston is an award-winning British-Chinese artist. Mother River has won the Shiseido photography prize (Beijing, 2016) and Reviewers’ Choice Award at FORMAT (Derby, 2014). It was nominated for both the Prix Pictet award and The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c152986fd5f30c91652d010c560c260819bc5b8/470_72_3455_2073/master/3455.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355623511c36be935d6918a2f9f8bccf","title":"make america talk again how to bridge the partisan divide","story":"Could the secret to healing a riven politics lie in a Difficult Conversations Laboratory?This is an edited version of a longer piece that you can find hereIn a hard-to-find windowless room deep inside a New York university, some difficult conversations are taking place. But this is not unusual, because this is a Difficult Conversations Laboratory.Though it does not physically resemble a dungeon, it probably should. Researchers conducting experiments here routinely generate the kind of excruciating discomfort that most of us spend every family gathering trying to avoid.Participants sign a waiver warning them that the experiments could cause stress or unpleasant feelings, before they are surveyed on a range of fraught topics, from abortion to the Israel-Palestine conflict. They are paired with someone who utterly disagrees with them and asked to talk things through around a small conference table. All while being recorded.It does not always go well – but that’s the point.“It is hard to study real-life, intractable conflict as it happens,” says the social psychologist Peter T Coleman, who started the lab over a decade ago with a group of colleagues. “This is an attempt to get as close as we can.” So far, the lab and several satellites worldwide have hosted and analysed nearly 500 contentious encounters.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theSo, as part of a longer piece of work on conflict, I visited Columbia University earlier this year to learn how its findings could be applied to the hyper-partisanship that has gripped the US. When asked in experiments to distribute hypothetical scholarships or cash awards, Americans are now more likely to discriminate based on political affiliation than on race. Manipulated by politicians, pundits and special interests, too many people have collapsed into lazy prejudice.So I sought out people who know conflict intimately and have developed creative ways of navigating it: mediators and other people who work with livid spouses, feuding business partners, and spiteful neighbours. They understand how humans behave when they feel threatened and angry – and how to break through to something more interesting.In the lab, after each conversation ends, the participants listen back to the recording and report their emotions at each point. When that data was fed into a graphic display, the researchers noticed something interesting. The better-quality conversations looked different: the patterns resembled a constellation of feelings, like data points spread across the galaxy of emotions, rather than a simple back-and-forth tug of war.In these conversations, people still experienced negative emotions, but not consistently. They cycled through frustration and discomfort, but also demonstrated a flexibility absent from the conversations that got “stuck”.“It’s not like they give up and say ‘oh, you’re right’. Nobody does that,” Coleman says. “But there’s more balance – of having your position and also being willing to ask questions.” The contrast with the other conversations was clear. “People who get stuck, they collapse into negativity. Everything the other person says is wrong and stupid. It’s an emotional collapse and a cognitive collapse – because they stop being able to process anything that the other person is saying.”Is this determined by the temperament of the people involved? Or is something else at work, something that could be induced in stressed out Americans?One condition that matters is subtle but logical: It turns out that when people build up even a small buffer of goodwill, their conversations go much better. Specifically, people need to have about three moments of positive feelings for every one moment of negativity. (The marriage expert John Gottman has found that married couples need a slightly higher ratio of about five good moments for every bad one – more evidence that marriage is harder than politics.)So complexity can be cultivated. But how do you generate goodwill in a debate about abortion with a stranger who vehemently disagrees with you?Gary Friedman has mediated more than 2,000 conflicts in his career. To create goodwill, Friedman practices a strategy called “looping for understanding”. You distill the essence of what the other person is saying, and then play it back to them. There’s no need to agree with the person – or even to pretend to like them. “The point is not to convince, nor to contradict, nor to take exception to, nor explain away,” as Friedman writes in Challenging Conflict, which he co-authored. “The point is to understand.” We are wrong more often than we think. To understand what someone really means requires a lot of double-checking. It seems obvious, a bit contrived, but it works like magic. Training with Friedman and a dozen other mediators earlier this year, I practiced looping and being looped, over and over again. I was humbled by how often I thought I’d understood the person, but had missed some important nuance.Later, as an experiment, I tried looping my 11-year-old son when he complained about having to go to bed. “You’re really frustrated that you can’t stay up later,” I told him. He went to bed. Using techniques like looping to build goodwill is helpful and important in our own conversations, but it can’t compete with the impact of cable news and talk radio. Is there a way to induce complexity at scale, regardless of how much goodwill we each can generate?Back at the Difficult Conversations Lab, researchers tried another experiment. Before participants met, they were given one of two versions of an article to read about a controversial issue such as immigration. One version laid out both sides of the issue, for and against immigration. The other contained the same information, but included more complexity, offering a spectrum of opinions. It read less like a traditional news story and more like an anthropologist’s field notes.Psychologists call this process “priming” – preparing participants to think in certain ways. The idea here was to prime one set of participants for complexity. And it worked. Again and again, people who read the more complicated article went on to have richer conversations. They asked more questions, proposed higher quality ideas and left the lab more satisfied with their conversations. “They don’t solve the debate,” Coleman says, “but they do have a more nuanced understanding and more willingness to continue the conversation.” Complexity is contagious.The lesson for journalists like me was clear: embrace complexity. Highlight nuance, contradiction and ambiguity wherever you can find it. For one thing, complexity leads to a fuller, more accurate version of reality. It also increases the odds that new information will be taken seriously. But journalists almost always do the opposite. Reporters cut the quotes that don’t fit the narrative, or our editor cuts them for us. We look for coherence, which is tidy and natural. But in a time of high conflict, coherence is bad journalism, bordering on malpractice. Tidy narratives gently warp reality until one side looks good and the other looks evil. Then our audiences soothe themselves with the knowledge that all Republicans are racist rednecks – or all Democrats are precious snowflakes who hate America.In reality, racist beliefs cross party boundaries. One in four supporters of Hillary Clinton in 2016 believed black people were lazier than white people. That doesn’t mean racism didn’t influence the election, only that it interacted with other forces, in many ways, in all kinds of people. In other words: it’s complicated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a29f00e9956ee350e30712fcce2025c2074851/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961ce99178b8213626a4c5b9b343aa6d","title":"cambodian pm hun sen fully fledged military dictator says report","story":"Hun Sen’s crackdown possible due to support of a cadre of ‘dangerous men’, says Human Rights WatchCambodian prime minister Hun Sen has become a “fully fledged military dictator” according to Human Rights Watch in a report released on Thursday investigating the extent of his personal control over the military and the police.The new report, Cambodia’s Dirty Dozen, names the 12 military personnel who have been the “backbone” of Hun Sen’s “abusive and authoritarian political regime,” which he has led since 1985. According to the report, Hun Sen has “remained in power by creating a cadre of ruthless members of the security forces to implement his vision and orders”.While Hun Sen while has always been notorious for his autocratic rule – his official title is princely exalted supreme great commander of gloriously victorious troops – and his use of force against anyone who defied him, his crackdown on the opposition, the media and civil society has escalated in the past year in the build up to elections in July. “Hun Sen really has become a fully-fledged military dictator, a fact that he hopes to hide behind the fig-leaf of a national election in July that will be neither free nor fair,” said Phil Roberton, deputy director of Human Rights Asia. Last year Hun Sen dissolved the opposition party, the CNRP, shut down the Cambodia Daily newspaper, Radio Free Asia and dozens of local radio stations. Journalists, opposition politicians and civil society leaders are now in jail and an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship has gripped the country.Hun Sen was able to carry out the brutal crackdown in less than six months without any backlash, because of his control over 12 senior military and police commanders and their subordinates. Twelve different institutions, from the supreme court, to local courts and government ministries, were used to implement the crackdown.With no legitimate opposition, Hun Sen’s victory in the elections is now seen as a foregone conclusion. “What this report reveals is the deep military roots that characterise Hun Sen’s rule,” said Roberton. “At each step of the way in his years in power, Hun Sen has sought to centralise control over the military and police under his direct command, aided by this group of dangerous men.”The Human Rights Watch report lays out how most of these men have been “implicated in the use of unnecessary, excessive, and sometimes lethal force against protesters” and have been involved in “non-political abuses against the ordinary population, such as land-takings, murder, torture, and arbitrary detention.”The complete absence of separation between military and politics is seen in the fact that hundreds of police and military now sit on the central committee of Hun Sen’s party, and that Hun Sen’s bodyguard unit – a military force personally under his control and out of the usual chain of command – went from having around 60 people in it in the mid-1990s, to having around 23,000 soldiers by 2015, according to Lee Morgenbesser, an expert on authoritarian regimes in southeast Asia.Hun Sen’s crackdown, carried out when he feared the opposition was gaining too much popularity in the lead up to the election, was made possible by broader international circumstance.China is investing billions into Cambodia as part of its belt and road initiative, and is willing to back Hun Sen’s authoritarian they have already declared that the election in July will be “free and fair”.The Trump administration in the US are also no longer holding the regimes in Cambodia and Vietnam to account over human rights abuses, as happened under President Obama.“To put it simply, this American administration don’t care about human rights and democracy in southeast Asia and that gave a pretext for Hun Sen’s crackdown,” said Morgenbesser. “The game has changed now . He almost doesn’t need to feign legitimacy to the US administration anymore about this election being ‘democratic’ – no one there is paying attention anymore.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3545457.1530126839!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures set to reach record levels as almost 31 degrees recorded","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman carries an inflatable shark on the promenade of Salthill beach onTuesday. Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne ReutersTemperatures are on track to hit record highs in the coming days with heat levels expected to reach at least 32 degrees. Temperatures soared on Wednesday afternoon, hitting 30.8 degrees by 4.30pm at Shannon Airport. These highs are expected to continue on Thursday with temperatures as high as 32 degrees in parts of the country. Meteorologist Joanna Donnelly said she expected the hot weather to peak at 32 degrees but it was possible the heat could continue to rise above that figure. The highest temperature ever recorded in Ireland was 33.3 degrees, at Kilkenny Castle, on 26th June 1887. In July 2006, the heat reached 32.3 degrees in the town of Elphin in Co Roscommon while in June 1976 it hit 31.6 degrees. During the summer of 1995, when Ireland basked in six weeks of unbroken sunshine, the peak temperature was recorded as 31.1 in Athy, Co Kildare. The high temperatures are expected to continue through the week, dropping slightly over the weekend and into next week. However, for now it looks like the sunny skies and warm weather are here to stay. “There’s no rain on the horizon,” said Ms Donnelly. “We’ve got these high, high temperatures until Friday and it’s still going to be warm through the week. There’s more uncertainty in the forecast beyond then.”Forecasters should be able to predict whether temperatures over the coming days will hit record levels by Wednesday evening, she added. Readings from Dublin at the same time were lower than most of the country, with temperatures of 24.5 degrees at Phoenix Park, and 23 degrees at Dublin Airport. The weather on Wednesday will continue the long, dry spell of sunshine seen since the weekend. Maximum afternoon temperatures will range from 26 to 30 degrees. It will be slightly cooler along coastal areas, due to onshore breezes, particularly on the east and south coasts. Temperatures in these areas will be closer to the low 20s, the national forecaster has said. Met Éireann’s national forecast for Wednesday night predicts temperatures of between 10 and 13 degrees, with fog patches across parts of the country in the very early hours of the morning. Overall temperatures for Thursday look set to be between 26 and 30 degrees. Ice cream brand HB said they expect to sell up to 2 million ice creams over the course of the week, due to the fine weather. In a statement, the firm said an estimated 11 HB brand ice creams were being bought per second, with Iceberger the most popular brand during the hot weather, followed by Brunch ice cream. The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service have warned the public over the increased risk of gorse fires, due to high temperatures and dry conditions. Mark Smyth of the wildfire unit said the weather was creating a “tinderbox” for gorse fires. Many gorse fires are started intentionally, but Mr Smyth warned the public of increased risks of accidental fires. “Gorse fires can also be caused accidentally by something as simple as throwing a cigarette from a car window, leaving a glass bottle on the ground, or not extinguishing a barbecue properly,” he said. Due to the fine weather, the pollen count is likely to significantly increase, which will affect those with hay fever. The Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU) issued advice for hay fever sufferers in the good weather. This included keeping windows closed when driving, to apply a small amount of Vaseline inside the nose to trap pollen, wearing wraparound sunglasses, and avoid cutting the grass or working in the garden. Water restrictions may be likely in the coming days as Irish Water are reaching “critical high” water usage in the greater Dublin area, during the heatwave. The utility have a production capacity of 610 million litres a day, on Monday 609 million litres of water was drawn down in the Dublin area.This is compared to a high point in water usage of 565 million litres a day during the summer last year. If the wider Dublin population does not take steps to conserve water and reduce usage, restrictions will be put in place, the utility has warned. In the last 24 hours water usage in the wider Dublin area dropped from 609 million litres a day to 603 million, Irish Water said on Wednesday.The dip, following calls to the public to conserve water shows “every small measure has a positive impact,” according to Kate Gannon, corporate affairs manager at Irish Water. “We have a long way to go. If the drought is prolonged, water restrictions would become unavoidable if demand does not continue to drop,” she said. “The situation remains critical and we are continuing to seek the public’s help. Every effort the public make to conserve water will help to minimise risk of supply loss to them and their community,” she said. Dublin Bus has committed to only wash their fleet of buses every three days, instead of once a day, in an effort to save water. Parts of Athlone, Kilkenny, Longford and north Dublin have experienced water restrictions and some outages, and areas in Donegal, Galway, Limerick and Mullingar are also at risk of shortages. The Irish Greyhound Board has suspended all racing trials between the hours of 10am and 7.30pm , due to the heat. A spokesman for the board said the conditions on tracks are being monitored, ahead of all race meetings. On Monday greyhound races at Longford were cancelled, but racing at Enniscorthy, Co Wexford and Youghal, Co Cork went ahead as planned, the spokesman said.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Paleobiologist Dr Maria McNamara loves fossils for the fascinating insights they can yield about ancient lifeRapid changes in farming have sounded the death knell for many of our 21 species of bumblebees and 75 species of \u0026lsquosolitary\u0026rsquo beesCo Meath native sues in US claiming Anglo fraudulently induced \u0026euro10m guaranteeFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader claims party will not discuss renewing confidence and supply agreementSafeguarding board told Government it had no central database of priests facing allegationsLabour force estimates reveal downward trend in EU nationals working in the NorthOld studio at Hanover Quay will be transformed into four-storey buildingMany awaiting decisions on refugee status now entitled to apply for jobs in most sectorsInternational Network of Civil Liberties Organisations report published in GenevaBr\u0026uacute na Bhfiann offers a haven for retired personnel down on their luckP\u0026aacutedraig Sch\u0026aumller visits Cape Cod five years after being involved in collision that changed his lifeArchaeological find will add to understanding of prehistoric Ireland, says historianMinister says that Independent\u0026rsquos legislation \u0026lsquosmacks of top-down approach\u0026rsquoMedical Council received 356 complaints down from 411 in 2016Warning issued after manufacturing error may have left glass fragments in products\u0026lsquoSomething fell between the gaps\u0026rsquo says department officialPope Francis visit expected to cost \u0026lsquomore than \u0026euro10 million but less than \u0026euro20 million\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil Bill to regulate internet threatens \u0026lsquounintended consequences\u0026rsquo, TDs told"},{"url":null,"title":"children heard crying and calling for parents in border facility recording","story":"Read and listen to the full story at:-  June 19, 2018Trump administration policy labelled \u0026lsquoinhumane\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoheartbreaking\u0026rsquo   June 19, 2018President blames Congress and loopholes in the law for \u0026lsquoillegal immigration crisis\u0026rsquo   June 20, 2018President tells Republicans he is \u0026lsquo1,000 per cent\u0026rsquo behind immigration reform efforts   June 20, 2018Word of Trump\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquozero tolerance\u0026rsquo border policy has sowed confusion on migrant trail "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546088.1530130023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"four gold bronze age rings discovered in co donegal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe four bronze Age gold pieces – which are large enough to fit around a person’s wrist –  were found in Co Donegal. Photograph: Caroline CarrDonegal County MuseumFour solid gold rings dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age have been found in Co Donegal. The National Museum of Ireland was alerted on Wednesday that four gold objects had been discovered and appeared to date back to the Bronze Age, the period between 3200 and 600 BC. Experts from the museum travelled to the site where the artefacts were discovered and carried out an investigation of the area to try and ascertain how and when the objects had been left there. The four rings, which are large enough to fit around a person’s wrist, have been transferred to the national museum where they will be put on display once initial investigations have concluded.Maeve Sikora, the museum’s keeper of Irish antiquities, said the find had been a “chance discovery” and would play an important role in adding to the history of Bronze Age Ireland. “Every archaeological find tells you something new about a particular period. For us it’s not just about the objects but also the context – it’s the whole package.”Ms Sikora said specialists at the museum would examine the gold in order to ascertain how long the rings had been lying in the ground. Most Bronze Age objects are discovered through archaeological digs but some just show up by chance, she said. “It’s an important archaeological find and will reveal something new about the area, that period of time and will add to our understanding of prehistoric Ireland and how rich the culture was then.” Ms Sikora said the museum was unable to reveal at this time where exactly in Donegal the objects were found.Lynn Scarf, director of the museum, thanked the “finders” and the local Donegal community for their co-operation and said the museum was delighted by the find. “We would also like to acknowledge our colleagues at the Donegal County Museum for their collaboration and assistance with this discovery, and look forward to working closely with them in relation to this find over the coming months.”Minister for Heritage Josepha Madigan also congratulated the people who discovered the objects and said her department was working closely with the national museum in their initial investigations. The last big Bronze Age discovery was in 2010 when a hoard of gold artefacts was recovered from a rubbish skip. The objects had previously been kept safe at a chemist’s shop in Co Roscommon after being discovered in a bog in nearby Coggalbeg in 1947 but were stolen during a robbery. Gardaí recovered the objects from the bin and they were handed over to the national museum.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesThe number of European Union workers employed across Northern Ireland has fallen by one quarter since the UK’s Brexit referendum, new figures reveal.As pressure mounts this week for a breakthrough in the ongoing Brexit negotiations with European Union (EU) leaders meeting for talks on June 28th and 29th, Belfast-based journalism website the Detail reports a downward trend in the number of EU workers employed in the North since the UK voted to leave the EU.Labour force estimates provided by Northern Ireland’s Department for Economy (DfE) reveal there were 14,000 fewer EU nationals working in Northern Ireland by the end of March 2018 compared to the period of the June 2016 referendum, representing a 26 per cent drop. The estimates do not include workers from the Republic of Ireland.Other available estimates show a falling number of Lithuanian workers while the number of Polish workers has fluctuated since June 2016.Honorary consul for Poland in Northern Ireland, Jerome Mullen said: “The falling numbers don’t come as a surprise to me because EU workers are not coming here and they’re not going to come. For EU citizens Brexit brings a lot of uncertainty and as we go forward, and that uncertainty continues, the fall in EU workers is only going to get worse.”This comes as a DfE report published in March found EU migrant workers were the key driver in employment recovery and growth in Northern Ireland between 2008 and 2016. During that period the number of EU workers grew by 40,000.A number of sectors in Northern Ireland are heavily reliant on migrant workers including manufacturing, the agri-food sector, hospitality sector, health and social care services, and retail and services sector.A survey of agrifood businesses by Northern Ireland Food and Drinks Association (NIFDA) also found 80 per cent of respondents saw a fall in the recruitment of EU workers since the Brexit vote. The survey, in SeptemberOctober 2017, involved 23 firms in the agrifood sector employing close to 5,000 people.NIFDA executive director Michael Bell said it was “definitely a significant challenge for the agrifood sector going forward. There is increased competition in the wider economy for what is now a diminishing pool of foreign national workers”.The Department for Economy did not comment specifically on the fall in EU workers but noted that labour force estimates may be subject to volatility and seasonal fluctuations.A skills barometer published by DfE and Ulster University in 2017 forecast that 80,000 jobs will be created by 2026 and that more than one third of these will be filled from a combination of graduates and migrant workers.Workers in the North from the rest of the EU, excluding the Republic of Ireland, account for 5-6 per cent of the North’s workforce but are an important resource for particular industries.Chief executive of Manufacturing NI Stephen Kelly said: “These are very concerning numbers and reflect what we’re hearing from business – workers are leaving, not returning and firms are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit replacements.”Founder of Grafton Recruitment and honorary consul for Hungary Ken Belshaw said currency fluctations were also influential. “We’re not seeing the same influx of labour from Eastern Europe as before and the key driver for that is a drop in the value of sterling. That’s a major indirect Brexit factor and it’s having an impact on whether people come here or not.”Mr Belshaw warned: “We’re now at crisis levels for skilled jobs like welders, fabricators, and LGV mechanics. We’re not getting the same influx of skilled labour from Eastern Europe for these jobs and workers are not available locally.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3546081.1530132756!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord hero michael lowry evades the d%C3%A1il","story":"Independent TD Michael Lowry from Tipperary has been fined €15,000 and his refrigeration company Garuda has been fined €10,000 after being found guilty of a tax offence and failing to keep proper books of account.

Photograph: Collins CourtsWhat a time to be alive. Leinster House was en fete. And in the mind’s eye, that steel scaffolding around the old mansion was lace bunting and the drab halls inside were festooned with Summer garlands. Because that is how people felt on Wednesday. The day after Michael Lowry’s Long Walk to Freedom.But a dark cloud hung over the Dáil. There was no sign of our hero. Each time the double doors opened, we hoped it might be him. It was not to be. Perhaps Lowry was too exhausted in the wake of his self-proclaimed “fantastic result” on Tuesday when he left court, exhilarated, as a “a free man” with nothing but four convictions for tax offences against himself and his refrigeration company along with an overall €25,000 fine and a trifling three year disqualification from acting as a company director. He also exited with unanswered questions about the Finnish money at the centre of the case which didn’t make it into his books at the first attempt because it initially detoured to the Isle of Man. Curiously, this money, a cool quarter of a million pounds sterling 16 years ago - never made its presence known to the investigators in the Moriarty Tribunal, who would have been extremely interested to find out more about it. But never mind that. By not being convicted on bigger tax charges, Lowry believes he is now vindicated after “22 years of absolute turmoil”. The Long Walk to Freedom.“No one understands unless you’re in the position if you’ve been harassed, chased and hounded by various institutions of the state,” he quivered outside the court. This, in particular, must have been a reference to his leading roles in the McCracken and Moriarty Tribunals. The former concluded a supermarket tycoon paid for a lavish extension to his house and the latter issued a damning verdict on then government minister Lowry’s “insidious and pervasive influence” on the decision to award Ireland’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone. But now this “fantastic result” is there to clear the air, the words of the judge wafting away all the bad stuff with his declaration that the Tipperary TD was a “conscientious tax payer” who previously “put his hand in his pocket” to settle a €1.4 million tax bill dating back to 1997.Sure you have to be delighted for Lowry. It was just unfortunate the main man wasn’t there to accept the plaudits from his peers. Some of us had been up all night knitting a red carpet.The Fianna Fáil leader couldn’t let the occasion pass without making some mention of him, although he didn’t mention the court case even though it is finished so he wouldn’t be prejudicing anything. He returned to his favourite topic: whether the government has a sneaky little voting deal with independents such as Lowry. This is something Micheál Martin has long suspected and nothing Leo Varadkar says will convince him otherwise. There may not be anything down on paper, but he knows the Taoiseach “continues to hide information” on the little local sweeteners he promises to the likes of Lowry and Sean Canney. He pointed out that Lowry has never voted against the government, which seems just a tad suspicious. Will Leo publish their agreement? “There is nothing to publish and nothing to hide” he replied, insisting there is no formal agreement with any of the independent deputies. There are “several” however who “generally support the government” and because of that they are allowed raise local or policy issues with ministers. “And if we can work on them, we do and where we can’t, we can’t.”“That’s a deal! That’s a deal!” chorused Micheál and his colleagues. Danny Healy-Rae wondered why they were getting so annoyed, as they have a confidence and supply agreement. “Sure you’ve a deal as well.”“Well, we’ve drawn the short straw” huffed Timmy Dooley.Unfortunately, after his 22 years facing difficult questions, Lowry wasn’t there to provide clarification on whether there exists a deal or a paper trail. A Moriartyesque state of affairs.He has always claimed he has “an understanding” with the current administration. Something the government denies. The Taoiseach then pointed out that no-deal Lowry doesn’t always vote with the government. Over the past two years, he has voted against on 10 occasions out of 170 (he wasn’t there for 89 of them). Finally, Socialist Ruth Coppinger mentioned the court convictions which crowned Lowry’s “fantastic” day. Strangely, nobody else wanted to touch them.She highlighted his tax offences for which he got “a chicken feed fine in the context of his wealth and a pat on the back from the judge rather than a rap on the knuckles, saying he was a great TD.”And as the leas Ceann Comhairle looking increasingly scandalised, she declared that workers all over the country will look at the case and conclude that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.Would the Taoiseach now “oblige judges not to give their own personal opinions about one of their own, but to actually prosecute serial tax offenders for tax evasion?” Pat the Cope Gallagher found his voice. “You can’t be referring to court judgments” he spluttered, “and making references such as that!”There had been a court case, deputy Lowry got a fair trial, a conviction followed, he was fined and barred from holding directorships, he said.It is the job of the courts to hear cases. Politicians do not overrule judges. “We’re not Soviet Russia.” And that’s all he was going to say about Michael Lowry.Except that “tax offences and tax crimes are serious crimes in my view and the view of the government. When somebody commits a tax offence they’re not just taking money from one person they’re taking money from all society.” Surely Leo wasn’t referring to no-deal Micheál with his fantastic convictions? Celebrating his 22 Year Walk to Freedom in the face of outrageous allegations and hounding by State institutions?Because they have an understanding. Nothing on paper, mind. A politician might be misunderstood.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3545631.1530106931!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald taken to task over remarks on new garda commissioner","story":"The Taoiseach has accused Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald of being “almost in the space of trying to undermine confidence in the new Garda commissioner before he’s even taken up office”.Leo Varadkar said that “when it comes to issues around truth and reconciliation, I think everyone has a part to play”, adding that this applied to Sinn Féin and “the people associated with Sinn Féin as much as it does to anyone else”.Mr Harris’s appointment was announced on Tuesday. He will take up office in September.Ms McDonald said Mr Harris had to earn that trust, “particularly in relation to his involvement with legacy cases.“He has to demonstrate he in no way subscribes to the toxic, vindictive policing culture which necessitated the disbanding of the RUC.”She referred to concerns voiced by victims of “British state violence” and comments on Mr Harris’s approach to the issue by Miami Showband massacre survivor Stephen Travers, who spoke of “the old RUC culture of political policing and cover-up”.She said similar concerns were raised by the Relatives for Justice campaign group, who said that “Mr Harris has at every opportunity sought to thwart families in the search for truth and accountability, that he has had a stranglehold on legacy and acted partially and with vested interest”.Ms McDonald said she wanted to acknowledge that Mr Harris “comes to this with his own story of loss and pain from the conflict in the North and that cannot be minimised”. Mr Harris’s father, an RUC officer, was killed in an IRA car bomb in 1989. His mother survived the attack.The Taoiseach said he offered his sympathies to anyone and any family affected by the Troubles, “during that awful period of our history in which various organisations wrought violence”.He said: “I think Drew Harris is going to be someone who can really bring about better policing in Ireland and greater accountability.“He was very much involved in the transition from the RUC to the PSNI, which I think we all agree has been a big success and I think he can bring those abilities to the Garda Síochána.”Mr Varadkar expressed his disappointment in Ms McDonald’s remarks. He said that “truth and reconciliation requires that everyone plays their part, that everyone who has information about crimes that were committed in the past, about atrocities involved, should bring that information forward and that applies to Sinn Féin and all of the people associated with Sinn Féin as much as it does to anyone else”.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3545842.1530140598!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"restoring border checks like trying to put apartheid back into south africa","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGregory Campbell DUP MP for East Londonderry champions what he sees as the positives of Brexit for Northern Ireland.   pictured at his office in Coleraine. Photograph: Jonathan PorterPressEyeKillea is a fairly typical Border village. A short drive from Derry, it’s a commuter spot for Northern Ireland’s second city, causing a recent increase in population.The village’s most distinguishable characteristic though, is that its streets and houses stretch across two separate sovereign states: the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.The multi-jurisdictional reality of life in the village has been a non-issue for locals since the late 1990s when the Border fully opened. Brexit, however, has created unease about the future.Michael Doherty is a timber merchant based in Killea. A small river which flows around his business marks where the Border lies.“We straddle the Border, so we work North and South, covering Donegal, Derry, Tyrone, Belfast, Dublin. Wherever we can get work, we take it,” he said.“We also import an awful lot of timber from the north, from England and from the south of Ireland. We work throughout the country, both selling and buying.“We don’t actually see a Border, except on paper for VAT returns and things like that, but not for day-to-day work.“Our lorries would cross the Border five,10 times every day. Even to go to the shop we would cross the Border.”Mr Doherty is concerned that a more physical manifestation of the Border will impact upon his drivers’ delivery speeds, among other things.“Our customer base, who are North and South as well, they will have to go through a border checkpoint to get in or out. A lot of people won’t want to do that. They’ll just find it’s easier to go somewhere else. I’m hugely concerned about that.”For most people living close to it, the Border has represented something that exists politically but is virtually invisible in everyday life since the Belfast Agreement.Ruairí O’Kane is from Derry but lives in the Donegal village of Muff.Working in the North in public relations, but living in the Republic, there are days when he repeatedly crosses the Border.He says people in the region have legitimate fears about the impact that Brexit could have on the Border.“On a purely practical level, driving in and out of Donegal and Derry yesterday, for example, I think I did that drive, over and across what would have been the Border six or seven times unhindered.“What happens in the future? Am I going to have to stop every time I nip in and out of Derry just during my day to day life?Denis Bradley’s life is reflective of an existence which chimes with many Border dwellers. Born in Buncrana in Co Donegal, but schooled in Derry city, much of his family remains in the county of his birth while he resides and works on the other side of the Border. Formerly a figure of influence in the peace process, he was later a vice-chair of the Policing Board and then joint-figurehead of a task force devising plans to deal with the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Bradley says he is “as near convinced as a human can be that it’s impossible to put a hard border in place”.“I don’t know if people outside of that fully understand that there is kind of a change in the mentality and the expectation of people . . . When the army and the police went and the Border opened up, which was nearly 20 years ago, there was a deep, deep freedom in that.“I don’t know how you put border checks back. I just don’t think that the people would accept it.“This is probably extreme but I’m going to say it anyway: it’s like trying to put apartheid back into South Africa.”“I might be wrong, but the people I talk to along the Border, like the farmers and shopkeepers, they wonder are these people crazy, are these people mad, are these people out of their mind, do they realise what they’re at?”Maintaining a hard border, he said, would require the unrealistic prospect of either the police or the army managing it.“I think it’s very interesting that the PSNI have been quietly, but very determinedly saying, ‘we can’t do this, we can’t police this situation, this is beyond our capabilities’.“So are we going to call the army back in again? I don’t think that’s going to happen, I just don’t think that it’s possible and if it’s not doable, then you have to come up with some other solution.”Mr Bradley does not subscribe to the view that Brexit will cause a surge in political violence as he detects little public appetite for a return to conflict. He also believes that people, particularly the nationalist community, do not comprehend the rationale of the arch-Brexiteers inside the British government.“There is a bit of shock at the DUP,” he said. “The nationalist population was already very angry with them, but they are kind of shocked by them now... Are the DUP insensitive beyond belief or are they so scared?”As a figure intimately familiar with the politics of the peace process, he feels the Brexit climate will increase discussion of Irish reunification and the permanent ending of partition.“The debate has now got to be in the broad discussion around what unity looks like. One hundred years ago nationalism had to adapt to living within the British system and I think Brexit means now, somewhere down the road, unionism is going to have to begin to adapt to Irish unity.“Thankfully they’re not going to be forced to do it, but that they are going to have to come to some growing realisation that nationalism is now so far out and is so dominant.“It might be five, 10, 20, or 30 years because people are very relaxed about it, they’re not pressing for it, they’re not saying it has to happen tomorrow, but they can see the beginning of that change.”Gregory Campbell was brought up in the Waterside in Derry. The prominent DUP politician has been the member of parliament for East Londonderry since 2001.Mr Campbell’s party has long opposed UK membership of the European Union. Now the Westminster arithmetic has left British prime minister Theresa May reliant on DUP support.He champions what he sees as the positives of Brexit for Northern Ireland while attempting to dispel what he describes as unsubstantiated fear-mongering by ardent remainers. He does, however, understand why there is some apprehension.“Part of the reason for that are the disgraceful and unwarranted comments that some people have made. Tony Blair and John Major, who came to the peace bridge in Londonderry on the week of the referendum, quite disgracefully, said a vote to leave could create violence in Northern Ireland.”He insists there will not be a hard border: “There are not going to be large infrastructures and there are not going to be cameras and customs posts. All of that is not going to happen.“The best reassurance will be in the next two or three years when people see that that is the case, that is what actually happens and life can continue.”Mr Campbell feels that Mr Bradley’s assertion that Brexit will ultimately lead to the break up of the UK is misguided.The Irish Government has said it is working to diminish the impact of any Brexit settlement on the island of Ireland. But, Campbell added: “If they had been confined solely to ensuring the benefits of business within the Republic, they would have been entirely understandable, but they seem to have allowed themselves to have been used as some sort of greater pawn.“Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have engaged in some very, very unfortunate and regrettable comments and statements. Hopefully we can all learn from these things and hopefully they can learn as well.”He conceded the UK should be further along with trying to sort out the Border.“Unfortunately some of the discussions have been quite difficult,” he said. “The EU has dug its feet in, in terms of proposals, but you expect this. This is something, remember, that no nation state has ever done before.“We are in uncharted territory... We will get there in the end, be it another year, 18 months or thereabouts. In five years’ time people will wonder: what was all the fuss about?”“I think Brexit will open up opportunities, not just for the northwest, but the whole of Northern Ireland, particularly with the close proximity to the EU.“There will be business opportunities now for people who want to expand into the UK, into the EU and beyond the EU. The expanding markets outside the EU are exactly that, they are expanding, whereas the EU as a percentage share of world trade is contracting.“We just need to ensure that businesses here are prepared to take advantage of that. It can be a win-win, and hopefully it will be.”Rory Winters is a reporter for Belfast-based journalism website, the DetailDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Leaders Awards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace on June 26, 2018The amount spent by the Prince of Wales on funding the activities of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry increased by 40 per cent with the arrival of Meghan Markle into the Royal family.Prince Charles paid £4.96 million towards the activities of Prince William, his wife and Prince Harry last year, an increase of £1.43m on the previous year’s total of £3.52m.The increase coincided with the first four months of Ms Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry from November last year, and is thought to have included a certain additional amount to pay for her activities and public engagements as his fiancee.The increased expenditure on the activities of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William is also understood to reflect their increased role in public life, following the decision by the Queen to reduce the number of duties she performs each year.Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex meet group of leaders during the Queen\u0026#39s Young Leaders Awards Ceremony at Buckingham Palace The amount spent by Prince Charles on his children\u0027s activities, along with other costs such as capital expenditure, was significantly larger in 2017-2018 than in previous years.In 2016-2017 it went up by 8.6 per cent and by 7.9 percent the year before. In 2014-2015 the increase was just 2.4 per cent, to £2.96m.Prince Charles pays for his children and their spouses from the income he receives from the Duchy of Cornwall, his hereditary estate which owns more than 131,000 acres across 23 counties, mostly in south-west England and in London.Figures published yesterday showed he received a record £21.73m from the Duchy in the year to the end of March, an increase of 4.9 per cent on the previous year.The amount paid by Prince Charles to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry does not include the cost of paying for their travel to royal engagements, as this is funded by the Queen out of the Sovereign Fund, paid for by the taxpayer.Funding for William, Kate and Harry\u0027s activities is listed under \u0027Other Costs\u0027, which also includes capital expenditure and transfer to reserves, but there is no further breakdown or detail.Palace sources acknowledged that the extra £1.43m spent by the Prince of Wales on his children coincided with the arrival of Ms Markel into the royal fold.However they refuse to say how much was spent on funding her activities and engagements, saying that Prince Charles expected a certain level of privacy.Clive Alderton, the Prince’s principal private secretary, said the past year included some notable “moments of great joy for the Royal family”.He added: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex became engaged, their wedding itself seemed to me a day when not just the sun shone but Britain itself shone - and right round the world.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that they were expecting another child and the Prince of Wales\u0027s third grandchild Prince Louis was born in April.”Meghan, Duchess of Sussex and  the Queen attend a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge in Widnes, on June 14, 2018 Ms Markle was given the title Duchess of Sussex following her marriage to Prince William at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle last month.Prince Charles uses his Duchy income to pay for his official duties, his London office and charitable work. The amount he received from the Sovereign Grant fell from £1.3 million to £1.2 million.Figures also revealed that the Royal family’s travel costs rose from £4.5 million to £4.7 million, the most expensive trip being £362,149 for the visit of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to India, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore between in October and November last year.Prince Charles used the Royal Train, which costs around £20,000 per trip, twice as much as the Queen, partly as a result of taking on more of her public engagements.The Prince voluntarily paid £4.85m in tax on his income last year, an increase of 2 per cent.Together with the Duchess of Cornwall he carried out more than 600 engagements across 15 countries.During 2017-18 the Prince of Wales’s charities and foundations raised more than £160m to support a variety of groups, including disadvantaged and vulnerable young people, rural communities, as well as funding craft preservation and sustainable development.The Queen\u0027s annual expenditure went up by around 13 per cent with the start of a decade-long programme of renovations at Buckingham Palace.The Sovereign Grant received by the monarchy from the taxpayer to pay for official duties and other expenditure rose from £41.9 million to £47.4 million, with staff costs, travel and property maintenance all going up compared with the previous year.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the figure represented an operational cost of 69p per man, woman and child in the UK, up from 65p last year.The Queen\u0027s net expenditure rose £5.5 million to £47.4 million for the year 201718, including £22.6 million for property maintenance - up from £17.8 million.Additional reporting by Toby WallisZombie knives \u0026#39causing sharp rise in knife crime deaths\u0026#39 as teen arrested over latest London murderJustice Anthony Kennedy\u0026#39s retirement sets up crucial Supreme Court battle for TrumpMarried city consultant carried drunk woman over his shoulder and raped her in alleyway, court hearsAsh clouds and toxic smoke spread for miles as \u0026#39apocalyptic\u0026#39 wildfires engulf Saddleworth MoorGPs dole out fewer antibiotics when paid bonuses to cut ratesHotel booking websites told to stop \u0026#39one room left\u0026#39 warningsMothers separated from newborns amid \u0026#39disgraceful\u0026#39 lack of specialist careQuality journalism must be preserved in fight against fake news, culture secretary warnsBanks squeeze money out of customers signing up for \u0026#39free\u0026#39 current accounts, FCA warnsSaddleworth Moor fire: Army called in and residents struggle to breathe as toxic smoke sweeps over homesNew drug could stop thousands of women dying every year after giving birthBritain \u0026#39heading for worst possible Brexit\u0026#39 over freedom of movement, warns Theresa May\u0026#39s former top aideFirst manslaughter conviction for DNP diet pill dealer after toxic pills killed student Melania Trump could visit British school to talk about bullying as a \u0026#39standalone\u0026#39 event on UK tourVillagers in Wales with slow internet dig own trenches to install superfast broadbandSyrian air strikes knock out hospitals in rebel-held Daraa as Russian-backed offensive gathers paceFrance to bring back National Service to promote sense of civic duty£200m hoard found in homes of ousted Malaysia PM Najib RazakDonald Trump to hold summit with Vladimir PutinThe highs and lows of Diego MaradonaMerkel under pressure on the eve of EU migration summitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/21/08/rock.jpg  width= 1035  height= 668  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/21/08/rock.jpg","title":"oumuamua asteroid comet object identity interstellar solar system nasa astronomy","story":"Created with Sketch.Despite lacking a distinctive \u0027tail\u0027, space rock from beyond our solar system is likely a comet, scientists concludeClick to followThe Independent OnlineOumuamua: scientists finally decide on real identity of mysterious interstellar objectAfter months of speculation about the identity of Oumuamua, or\u0026nbspthe first “alien” object from outside our solar system, scientists have come to a conclusion about what it is.\u0026nbspThe space rock first identified by astronomers in November, has been variously described as an asteroid, a new variety of “interstellar object” and even an alien spacecraft.\u0026nbspBut new tests have revealed it is in fact a comet, despite lacking some of the key characteristics that would normally allow experts to identify such an astronomical body.“From theoretical models we were expecting interstellar objects to be mostly cometary, on the basis of the region of the planetary systems where they form,” said Dr Marco Micheli from the European Space Agency“However, Oumuamua did not look as a comet in optical images we obtained, since it did not have a coma or a tail. This led to a reclassification of it as an asteroid.”While asteroids are made up of rock and metals, comets form from ice, dust and rocky fragments and move through space in a different way.Oumuamua lacked the tail that forms as comets melt and release gases and dust, meaning it was difficult to determine what exactly it was.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It’s likely that thousands of tribespeople in what is now Scotland (mainly from the Caledonian and Maeatae tribal confederations) were killed.The Romans claimed that the native chieftains had reneged on a peace agreement – and were therefore rebels, not just ordinary enemies. It is likely that the sacred bronze hand was ritually buried by one of the Roman commanders who had taken part in the conflict.Rome’s indignation (feigned or real), over the natives reneging on the peace agreement, was particularly acute because the 50,000 strong invasion had been led by none other than the reigning emperor himself – an ex-general called Septimius Severus. His personal political credibility was therefore very much at stake. The war, associated with the newly discovered bronze “hand of god”, was therefore a particularly bitter one.To evoke the anger apparently felt by the Romans, a famous Roman writer of the time, Cassius Dio, when writing his account of the conflict, put a particularly bloodcurdling speech (borrowed from the Iliad – the epic ancient Greek tale of the Trojan War, traditionally ascribed to Homer) into the mouth of the Emperor.In Dio’s account, the borrowed speech instructs the Roman army to annihilate the Scottish tribes. “We are not going to leave a single one of them alive, down to the babies in their mothers’ wombs – not even they must live. The whole people must be wiped out of existence, with none to shed a tear for them, leaving no trace.”Ancient Roman tablets discovered in LondonExceptional presevation of wood owing to the wet ground of the lost Walbrook riverExcavating a Roman building where many tablets were disocveredArchaeologist with a tablet just discovered at the Bloomberg siteRoman barrel found nearby.

His bronze hand was often mounted on the top of a poll – and used to bless or sanctify his followers during religious rituals inside his temples.Dolichenus, before conservation (Vindolanda Trust)It had been deposited in a small bog almost certainly as part of a religious ritual to mark the completion of a temple dedicated to the god just 15m\u0026nbspaway.The cult must have been particularly important to the regiment based at Vindolanda or its commander – because the temple was very unusually built inside the fort. It is the only example of such a phenomenon known from anywhere in the Roman empire.The regiment based there was a Gaulish (French) originating unit of auxiliary infantry and cavalry – known as the fourth\u0026nbspcohort of Gauls.\u0026nbspIts commanding officer, a wealthy upper-class Roman called Sulpicius Pudens (potentially the one in post when the temple was constructed and the bronze hand deposited) appears to have been a particularly devoted follower of the cult. He personally funded one of the two main altars inside the Vindolanda Fort temple and another altar (probably also associated with Jupiter Dolichenus) at a nearby sulphur spring.The unique decision (possibly by Sulpicius Pudens himself) to build the temple inside the fort and the associated ritual deposition of the god’s bronze hand – both immediately following the end of the largest military combat operation ever to take place in Britain – was almost certainly not a coincidence.Vindolanda Trust)As probable thanksgivings for survival and victory, they represent additional evidence of the epic and almost certainly particularly brutal nature of the military campaign.Roman military operations varied considerably in terms of their treatment of rebel and other populations.Occasionally, they were particularly brutal and more rarely downright genocidal. The most lethal campaigns in Roman history included the siege and complete destruction of Carthage (146 BC) in which 200,000 people died, the mass crucifixion of 6,000 captured slaves at the end of Spartacus’ war (71 BC), Julius Caesar ‘s massacre of the Rhineland tribes (55 BC) in which up to 400,000 were killed, the Jewish revolt of 70 AD\u0026nbspin which hundreds of thousands died (including thousands of prisoners who were crucified) and the second Jewish revolt of 132-135 AD\u0026nbspin which up to 600,000 died.The campaign in Scotland was unusually massive, emperor-led and probably very aggressive and brutal – but no credible figures on casualties on either side have survived and may indeed never even have been aggregated and recorded.Certainly, just prior to the main huge invasion, the Romans switched tactics from paying diplomatic bribes and sweeteners to Scotland’s tribes to carrying out overt military actions. Some of the diplomatic bribes – hoards of Roman silver coins – are on show at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.Vindolanda. It features a portrait of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus – the man who ordered and led the invasion (Vindolanda Trust)Archaeological evidence (the locations of diplomatic gifts of silver coinage pre-and post invasion) also suggests that the war permanently altered the geopolitical tribal balance – so it is therefore likely that specific tribal groups were at least politically (and possibly physically) neutralised from the regions geopolitical equations.“It was almost certainly one of the most brutal military campaigns ever fought on British soil. It’s likely that future archaeological investigations over the coming years will reveal the full horror of this long-forgotten conflict,” said archaeologist and historian Dr Simon Elliott, author of a new book on the war,\u0026nbspSeptimius Severus in Scotland: the Northern Campaigns of the First Hammer of the Scots.Fascinatingly and ironically, it is likely that the Roman invasion of Scotland which was meant to solve military and political problems (and partially succeeded in doing so for several decades) destabilised and destroyed the Scottish geopolitical status quo and ultimately helped lead to the rise of the Picts who in the end constituted a much greater threat to Roman Britain and ultimately helped destroy it. Although the invasion and its consequences occurred more than 1500 years ago, they demonstrate how military actions that may appear logical at the time often end up having longer term implications that the politicians (in this case a Roman emperor) had not envisaged or prepared for.Why ancient Roman vineyards are reopening in eastern GaliciaRoman mosaics ruined in botched restoration jobTourists caught carving initials onto walls of ancient Roman Colosseum before taking a selfieIn this case, Septimius Severus\u0026nbspdied before the conflict had been fully resolved – and his sons, who succeeded him, had absolutely no interest in Britain and quickly returned to the fraught political rather than military fray in Rome (the elder son murdering his younger brother just 11 months after their father’s death).“The discovery of Jupiter Dolichenus’ bronze hand, deposited as a thanksgiving offering, demonstrates just how serious the conflict was and how relieved the Roman soldiers were that it had ended,” says\u0026nbspDr Andrew Birley, director of the Vindolanda excavations.“It is further evidence illustrating how deeply religious they were and how seriously they took their relationship with their god,” he says.The bronze hand will be on permanent display at Vindolanda Museum as from today.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An existing\u0026nbspstate of emergency, they\u0026nbspstressed, also limited freedom of expression and assembly for political parties.The delegation from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\u0026nbspcomplained that some monitors were obstructed in carrying out their work. Ignacio\u0026nbspSanchez Amor, the group’s special coordinator, said it was “utterly unacceptable” that two members of the team were denied entry into the country.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultMr Erdogan described the election process as “an example to the rest of the world”. In his victory speech he returned to a recurring theme in his campaign: that he was the leader to\u0026nbspstand up for Turkey against western powers. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God, you have given a lesson to those who want for Turkey to kneel,” he told his cheering followers. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”Foreign interference and sabotage had been blamed by Mr Erdogan and his supporters for a range of the country’s ills, including the plummeting national currency, the Lira. The president, who had said he would play a key role in forming economic policy in his new administration, declared that vast infrastructure developments\u0026nbspbeing undertaken will lead to massive boosts in employment and growth. The projects include Kanal Istanbul, a 45 kilometre channel linking the Black and Marmara\u0026nbspseas and the airport to replace Istanbul’s Ataturk, provisionally named the New Istanbul Airport, but, it is claimed in local media, which may end up being called\u0026nbspErdogan Airport.The conflicts\u0026nbspagainst Kurdish militants home and abroad are set to continue,\u0026nbspwith new operations planned. The mission was to “fight terrorist organisations” and\u0026nbsp“to continue the fight to make Syrian grounds freer”, Mr Erdogan said. Fresh offensives are also expected to be launched against Kurdish fighters in the southeast of the country. “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” the president\u0026nbspsaid. “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.”Erdogan proclaimed winner of Turkey’s presidential electionThe pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeoples’\u0026nbspDemocratic Party (HDP)\u0026nbspbroke through the 10 per cent barrier in the elections and so\u0026nbspwill have a significant number of MPs in parliament. Nine of its newly elected MPs, including the leader, Selahattin Demirtas, have been imprisoned.\u0026nbspThe HDP\u0026nbspgains\u0026nbspwere expected to make the opposition groups the majority in parliament,\u0026nbspbut Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party did better than expected as did its allies, the far-right\u0026nbspNationalist\u0026nbspAction Party\u0026nbspwho secured\u0026nbspdouble the support polls had forecast. This means the ruling coalition will keep control.The election wins\u0026nbspkeep 64-year-old Mr Erdogan in office until 2023, the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. He can then, under the new constitution, run for another term as president, and one more if he were to call an early election. Thus\u0026nbspallowing him to stay president, theoretically, until 2032, easily surpassing the tenure of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.During\u0026nbspthe election campaign Mr Erdogan had mooted that the state of emergency, brought in following the failed coup blamed on exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, would be lifted. More than 50,000 people remain in prison and another 140,000 have been suspended or fired from their jobs.Turkey’s democracy isn’t over yet, but it will be soonErdogan declared winner of Turkey\u0027s presidential electionSix arrested for ‘insulting Erdogan’ as polls open in Turkey electionsThe president has not given a timeframe for the easing of the punitive measures or any indication on whether they would be lifted totally.\u0026nbspHis new powers, in any event, allow\u0026nbsphim to impose draconian measures with minimal interference from the judiciary.There were some among opposition supporters who would rather not wait to see whether there would be an outbreak of benevolence from the president after his victory.Adem Bulent, a 20-year-old student and CHP supporter, said he has begun to explore whether he can finish his studies abroad. It was not just the defeat which disappointed him, but the way the political parties accepted it. “They talked about how unfair it was, they talked about vote rigging, then this happens against all the expectations, and then –\u0026nbspnothing,” he said, waving\u0026nbsphis arms in exasperation. “I think the chance has come and gone, there is no point in pretending otherwise.”The extent of the gloom felt by those who expected change\u0026nbspwas expressed by an academic staring into his coffee on Monday morning at a cafe in Istanbul’s fashionable Nisantasi district. Suleiman had stayed up\u0026nbspmost of the night in front of the television with the forlorn hope of the figures changing. “Just how bad was it? Well let’s say for us it was Trump and Brexit rolled into one, that’s how bad it was,”\u0026nbspwas his damning verdict.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Furious reaction at \u0026lsquoidiot\u0026rsquo Tony Blair for populism                 Tony Blair calls for Brexit to be postponed if no deal by March 2019Senior Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: The more he lectures the public about how wrong they are on Brexit the more it stiffens the resolve of the British people.He hasn\u0026rsquot yet twigged that he is as popular as a rattlesnake in a lucky dip.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of the Brexit-backing pressure group Change Britain, said: Tony Blair will never accept that the British people voted to take back control, and will try everything he can to prevent the UK from leaving the EU.There have been enough delays already. The public just want politicians to get on with delivering a clean Brexit.Blair would do well to respect the votes of 17.4 million people, rather than have the arrogance to believe their democratic wish should be overturned.NCTony Blair said the UK could negotiate a new membership deal with a reformed EUPeter Bone, another Tory MP, said: Tony Blair is on another planet. What he is saying is anti-democratic - he needs to understand that the people have spoken.People who keep talking about new negotiations for an improved membership deal need to remember that David Cameron tried that and didn\u0027t get very far.We had a referendum and we voted to come out.Mr Blair thinks that the elite like him know better than the British public but that is not how democracy works.The Prime Minister will be in Brussels tomorrow furthering the cause of Brexit and we now have an Act of Parliament ensuring we will come out.Blair will just not give up.                     AFPGetty Images1 of 6\u0027It can be stopped, if the British people decide that having seen what it means, the pain-gain analysis doesn\u0026rsquot stack up\u0027I am afraid Mr Blair needs to accept that we are coming out of the EU and it is going to be a great success.And Nigel Evans, also a Leave-backing Tory MP said: Tony Blair appears to have spent so much time advising dubious foreign regimes that some of their anti-democratic attitudes rubbed off on him.Mr Blair once promised us a referendum on an EU treaty and then took the offer away. He should accept that he is partly responsible for Britain voting the way it did in 2016.Mr Blair is earning millions of pounds travelling the world and giving advice - but we\u0027re not paying and we won\u0027t be listening to him.Mr Blair\u0027s inflammatory remarks came in a speech at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank in London yesterday.Leave-backing Tory MP Nigel EvansThe former prime minister suggested that Mrs May should start planning to delay the March 2019 deadline for Brexit as a result of the political deadlock over the kind of deal the UK wants with Europe.He argued there was still the chance for Britain and Europe to strike a bargain which could see the UK staying in.We should plan now for the possibility we need to extend the March 2019 deadline, he said.Presently, we are drifting towards March 2019 with no clear negotiating position, no resolution of the Northern Ireland question, still vaguely hoping Europe will allow us access to the single market without abiding by its rules which it will never do, and with senior Cabinet members openly debating the merits of a negotiating position which \u0027threatens\u0027 Europe with a no-deal Brexit.This is the equivalent of holding a negotiation on the top floor of a high-rise building and \u0027threatening\u0027 to jump out of the window if our demands are not met.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage.Mr Blair acknowledged that supporters of globalisation were under pressure from outspoken political groupings on the Right and Left campaigning against free trade, open-door migration and international cooperation.Once it is clear the populism isn\u0027t working because, ultimately, it offers only expressions of anger and not effective answers, the populists may double down, alleging that failure is the result of half-heartedness and that only more of the same will work, he said.Who knows where the dynamic of that scenario takes us. Then the comparisons with the 1930s no longer seem far-fetched.He added: We are losing sight of the values which brought the West together, saw it through the menace of fascism and communism and, for all our justifiable grievances, have wrought immense progress.The whole thing has become so protracted that it has numbed our outrage, says Tony BlairThe former prime minister continued: Brexit has become a metaphor for the debate around globalisation.The only way out of the cul-de-sac of populism is to understand that the case for globalisation will not succeed unless we deal with the underlying grievances of that part of the population for whom globalisation holds more fear than hope.Europe and Britain could strike a bargain which would see Europe reforming, which the European people plainly by their votes are demanding, and Britain staying in such a Europe.For Europe as well as for Britain, this means dealing with the issue of immigration decisively.For all nations, it will require more active government intervention, helping people and communities \u0027left behind\u0027.The Conservative MP is known for his upper-class mannerisms and traditionalist views                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10In a BBC interview ahead of his speech yesterday, Mr Blair said it was a huge myth the he had allowed uncontrolled immigration while prime minister but conceded he would take a tougher approach to movement within the EU.It\u0027s true we were in favour of freedom of movement within the European Union, though again, if I was back in office today I would be arguing we apply those rules much more toughly, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Reform Group of Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers, said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a very expensive bargain, if we were foolish enough to listen to Mr Blair and re-join then we would lose our remaining rebate.\u0026ldquoThe other half he gave away for a phantasmagorical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but he has always been better at husbanding his own resources than those of taxpayers."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/traffic-uk-manchester-cycling-walking-network-980566.jpg","title":"traffic uk manchester cycling walking network transport for greater manchester","story":"Transport for Greater Manchester74 miles of busy roads could be uprooted in the Manchester schemeThe \u0026pound500million Beelines scheme will mean dozens of miles of A-roads in Greater Manchester could be uprooted.The scheme sets out plans for 1,400 sets of upgraded or new traffic lights and 75 miles of \u0026ldquoAmsterdam-style segregated bicycle lanes.Transport for Greater Manchester hopes the five-year scheme - which was launched today by Mayor Andy Burnham and ex Olympic gold medalist Chris Boardman - will help in creating \u0026ldquothe UK\u0026rsquos most comprehensive cycling and walking network.But the plans have sparked public outrage after it emerged at least 74 miles of \u0026ldquobusy roads, including the heavily congested A6 and A56 roads, are among those which face being dug up and being reduced in width to make way for cycling lanes.Roadworks will also cause delays - particularly at busy traffic junctions - as pavements and roads will be dug up as part of the scheme which aims to encourage bike use.

But that’s down to a general lack of finance and not enough officers.Lancashire has an abysmal solved burglary rate of just 5.5%, compared with a high of 18% in affluent university town Durham.The disturbing statistics, uncovered by The Sunday Times, paint a sorry picture for the residents of Burnleys poorer areas.Although the local force insist the research was misleading, residents in the neighbourhood known locally as Crack City have told The Sun Online they DO feel let down.As a retired Lancashire police officer, Mr Sturgeon is well-placed to judge the failures of the modern force.In the streets around his home last year there were 102 burglaries recorded. Not one of them was solved.The ex-cop, who has has been a victim himself, believes the high crime in the area is due to an underfunded police force and officers being forced to “turn a blind eye” to a lot of offences.He added: “Many crimes, such or burglaries or where people are going into empty houses and nicking the boilers and stripping away copper cable, simply can’t be investigated because they don’t have the resources.But there’s also a lot of apathy, to be honest.The problems in Burnley are by no means unique and the last six months has seen an explosion in violent crime on the UKs streets.Just this week a moped gang targeted a mother and her three-year-old daughter on the streets of leafy Richmond in London.But the problem has been growing for some time around Burnleys Leyland Road.Locals blame the transient population for much of the anti-social behaviour and crime and there is no doubt the many derelict buildings are a magnet for trouble.Shopkeeper Amjad Ali once had to fight off a burglar  who he caught red-handed kicking in his back door.He said: I’d got this phone call to say someone was in my back yard.When I asked this guy what he was doing, he said, ‘I didn’t know it was your house.’He punched me but I managed to hit him back before he ran off.On this particular occasion the police did manage to arrest the burglar - and it transpired he was a repeat offender and it was his 100th offence.In another terrifying attack, Amjads mother had a knife held to her throat in an armed robbery.Out of a total of nearly 5,900 neighbourhoods with more than 20 burglaries last year, cops failed to solve 3,105 cases – over half of the crimes.New figures show that seven out of ten burglary investigations were closed without police ever identifying a suspect.The shocking figures prompted the Police federation to comment that burglars were getting used to “never being stopped by police, never mind arrested.”The Sunday Times revealed the figures after carrying out an investigation examining crime figures for 34,250 neighbourhoods in England and Wales.Salisbury, Canterbury, Cambridge, Oxford and St Albans all have high rates of where burglaries go unsolved.The Police Federation operational policing leader Simon Kempton said the lack of funds were having a “massive effect” on the ability to solve crime.The 45-year-old said many crimes in Burnley itself simply went unreported while police ignore others simply due to a “lack of evidence”.Crack is a real problem, he said.People start taking it and they don’t realise the consequences. They end up getting hooked and then need money to pay for it.These people will watch someone’s house or just go walking by and realise it’s empty and break in and take whatever stuff they can so they can sell it and then buy drugs.As the police struggle to keep on top of the regular petty burglaries, some locals are instead stepping up their own private security to avoid becoming targets.Among them is Azhar Shah, whose home has been burgled four times in four years.Its gotten so bad he has installed CCTV cameras around his home to protect his family.Last year, thieves stole a £400 television when he popped out to visit his mother and he once woke up in the middle of the night to find raiders attempting to break in through the kitchen window.On another occasion his huge fridge freezer - plus its contents - vanished but when he rang police to report the crime he claims he was given a “ticking off” for using 999 because it “wasn’t an emergency”.“I keep a baseball in the house because I’m worried for my children,” he said.“I’ve lived here for 40 years and the easier thing would be to just move out.“But I don’t want the criminals to win.”He said the local bobby on the beat was fantastic at her job, but added: If we had more like her it would be great but the police just can’t be bothered investigating a lot of crimes.Burnley Councillor Sue Graham told The Sun Online it was down to more resources for local government and police to tackle the problem.She said: Its a problem that has persisted in areas where theres low income and a transient population.At the end of the day, it boils down the police forces.Last year, the Police Federation warned that police officers were taking as long as a week to respond to burglaries because of crippling staff shortages.Lancashire Police today insisted the data was misleading, saying many of the properties targeted were derelict with copper piping and boilers stolen.They said of the 109 reported burglaries, five people had been arrested but no further action had been taken.A spokesperson told The Sun Online: We have had jail terms of over 60 years since January for some of our most prolific burglars.We are also reinvesting in targeted crime teams across the county which will look specifically at tackling burglary."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004151362813.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says business brexit brussels","story":"But they should be far angrier about how Brussels has spent the last two years.It’s not the British that have responded to every proposal with a “non” or “nein” and a spiteful background briefing.Big businesses taking potshots at the Prime Minister could use their time better by pushing the EU to work on the trade deal we’ve consistently asked for.One that allows our businesses to trade with their European partners — but also one that means BMWs can be sold on British forecourts, too.Rather than ramping up Project Fear: The Sequel, bosses must demand that Brussels starts negotiating in good faith to keep trade ties with the world’s fifth largest economy.It might be useful for them to remind Brussels that if the EU “punishes” Britain with tariffs and restrictions, the UK Government would have to hit back.Business leaders keep banging on about “certainty”.Well, we are CERTAIN Britain will succeed outside the European Union.We’re CERTAIN we’ll be an open and global trading nation — as shown by Parliament, we hope, finally approving Heathrow’s expansion later today.And we’re CERTAIN the EU has been more interested in self-preservation than a deal since we voted to leave.Brussels bureaucrats must be warned that their precious project isn’t more important than the European economy.FINALLY, it looks like thinking Tories are cottoning on to the housing crisis.But it needs leadership from the top to solve our biggest domestic concern.MP Neil O’Brien’s scheme may not be perfect.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I never took a gap year and Id always fancied doing a bit of travelling - and what destination could be more adventurous than the final frontier?It only took a few hours before I heard back with the good news - Im in, which means I can vote on the direction of Asgardias future and, hopefully, be eligible to leave the planet one day when Asgardias first space expeditions get off the ground.Citizens from over 200 territories have applied to become Asgardians, and its current citizen count makes it the 172nd largest country in the world.Within 10 years, Asgardias leaders hope to have recruited 150 million people, and the dream is that the first ark - a satellite like the International Space Station - will be able to launch within a few decades time.Low Earth orbit is already well developed in terms of successful short-term human habitation, Lena De Winne, Asgardia’s Deputy Head of Administration, told us. However, for permanent habitation, we will need to address the issues of a lack of gravity and cosmic radiation.We’re planning on building space arks equipped with artificial gravity and shields from cosmic radiation and other space threats to allow for permanent human habitation.So far, the nation hasnt put anyone in space, but it has launched its own unmanned satellite, Asgardia-1, which is currently deployed in low-Earth orbit, moving at speeds of 7.6km per second.Next up, the country plans to establish its own digital currency, dubbed the solar, and bigger upcoming projects include designing a protective shield to guard humankind from space debris and asteroids.So far, the UN hasnt let Asgardia into the club of Earth-dwelling nations, but the nations founder says he is in informal talks with a few heads of state to get Asgardia recognised as a real country.Asgardia is the brainchild of Dr Igor Ashurbeyli, a billionaire Russian-Azerbaijani businessman and scientist who was formally inaugurated as Asgardias head of state at a grand ceremony at Viennas Hofburg Palace on Monday.Bizarrely, he was sworn in by former partner of Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia, Lembit Opik - a keen advocate of space exploration and one of Asgardias most high profile citizens.While his terrestrial political career is long over, Opik has been successfully elected to one of the 150 seats on the Asgardian parliament, along with Nigel Evans, President of the British Parliamentary Space Committee.“Today, it’s time to open space up economically, socially and culturally for all humankind, Opik says. That’s Asgardia’s mission.”“As the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, the country is liberated to invest in a truly global space community, and the Government has recognised this with substantial investment in the UK space sector.“Asgardia welcomes British citizens who share the dream of human opportunities in space for all countries, not just the privileged few who can afford a presence in space.There was a time when only the British Upper Class could travel abroad. Now it’s possible for all to do it.Dr Yun Zhao, Asgardia’s Head of Supreme Court, told Sun Online: There is no law that says that a nation should be attached to the surface of the Earth. Therefore, we are able to say that we have our territory free from the surface of the Earth.We are a nation whose population happens to reside in different countries—there is no law that says that as a citizen of a nation you must live there, there is no law which states that a nation must be big enough to host all of its citizens at one time.Ashurbeyli fears Earth will soon be destroyed by environmental degradation or a catastrophic nuclear war, and so he thinks its important that humanity can leave the planet before its too late.As such, he wants to start again with his own country and put space politics over geopolitics... a grand ambition which he has bankrolled entirely on his own so far.A qualified engineer, Azerbaijan-born Dr Igor Ashurbeyli made his fortune in a string of successful tech businesses.His exact net worth is not known, but its widely reported that Ashurbeyli is comfortably in the billionaire club.He founded software company Socium in 1988, before moving to Moscow to work with a string of military and scientific companies.Hes previously worked as a consultant for the UN, advising on how to protect Earth from asteroids and space threats, and he has edited an international space journal, ROOM, since 2014.Space has been a lifelong passion, and hes poured his own money into Asgardia, which he formally founded around 20 months ago.  In the future, he plans on charging a 100 euro annual citizenship fee, as well as collecting income and business taxes from members, to sustain the grand and expensive Asgardian dream.There are also plans to one day vet citizens by IQ, but at this point it looks like Asgardia will take anyone they can get, so long as theyre committed to a future away from our planet.The timeline for leaving Earth behind? Just 25 years, by which time Ashurbeyli hopes to establish a permanent human settlement on the moon.In the meantime, hes trying to find some political backing for Asgardia on the world stage, and iron out pesky admin stuff... like actually building life-supporting arks and getting millions of people into space.“This day will certainly be recorded in the annals of the greatest events in the history of humankind,” Ashurbeyli said in his inaugural speech.“We have thus established all branches of government. I can therefore declare with confidence that Asgardia – the first space nation of the united humankind – has been born.”Asgardia may be slowly heading towards recognition as an official country, but theres still a long way to go. Its probably safe to say that we dont need to worry about facing them in the group stages of the World Cup any time soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross. To them it means you’re parochial and even racist.It is time we killed off that myth and showed the same pride in our flag as the world does in theirs.What better time to start than with Harry Kane’s boys off to a flier in Russia?

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

consisting of around 20,000 car washes nationwide - is rife with exploitation.At one site staff were forced to live on spare change vacuumed from underneath car seats, the Times reported.Victims are often brought over from Eastern Europe on the promise of paid work and a better life in the UK.But many have their passports seized or are threatened to stop them running away.Dr Jardine, a researcher at the University of Nottinghams Rights Lab, said workers are often forced into debt to their captors who claim they are owed money for their accommodation or transport.In many cases their accommodation is little more than a mattress in an over-occupied house — or a foul illegal tenement.Romanian slave worker Sandu Laurentiu-Sava, 40, died after being electrocuted in a rat-infested shower behind a car wash in Bethnal Green, East London.In January his boss Shaip Nimani, 52, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was jailed for four years.And in April two Czech brothers-in-law were convicted on slavery charges after forcing workers to wash cars in Cardiff for little or no money.Roman Feko and Ladislav Fedak targeted homeless or vulnerable men, driving one to attempt suicide after learning he was bought like a piece of furniture, the BBC reported.Mihai, another Romanian slave worker, was forced to wash cars in Cumbria for 11-hours a day with no breaks — for as little as £30, the Evening Standard reported.Fuel retail industry representative Teresa Sayers said the cost of a car wash for a legal business to break even is around £6.40.It means drivers paying less than this are likely funding an exploitative firm.She told the environmental audit committee: If everything is very, very cheap it is clearly an indication that they are cutting corners or somebody is being exploited.If you are to do a more in-depth valet its about £12, and thats without making any money.A Nottingham Business School study of 45 hand car washes found none paid the national minimum wage.Earlier this month the Anglican and Catholic churches in England urged the public to report suspicious car washes to the police to tackle slavery.They launched The Safe Car Wash app to help drivers identify signs of forced labour.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described modern slavery as a scourge which is damaging so many people’s lives."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416504971.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emmanuel macron forces french schoolkids to learn about europes flag and anthem to stop the country following us out of eu","story":"Children from the age of six to 12 will be taught more about how Europe was created to try and ward of Euroscepticism, under new plans drawn up by Emmanuel Macron.The changes to the French curriculum are hoped to ward people who were born into the families of people who immigrated to the country from being indoctrinated by hateful preachers.Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, the education minister, wants pupils from the age of 6 to learn La Marseillaise, as well as the origins of Frances flag.And to avoid any temptations about a possible Frexit, they will also be taught about the EUs flag and be able to recognise the blocs anthem, Ode to Joy, which Macron played on his election night.The changes will be rolled out across the country in the autumn, and will try to make sure their kids grow up to be Europeans and patriots of France.By the age of 10 pupils will be expected to sing the songs in public and know what democracy means.And their final year of primary education will include being taught about obeying the law, paying taxes and respecting others.When they get into secondary school they will be taught more about the meaning of Europe and what it means to be a European.The new programme is being drawn up by the education ministry as part of plans to counter radical Islamic extremism.But primary schools have had to teach La Marseillaise from 2005.Today Theresa May announced that No10 would proudly fly the England flag on days where were playing key World Cup matches -

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg.

It is a national scandal that they should have been put in this position for so many years.”The CMA had suggested a national network of road signs displaying prices along a motorway route.

No-one could possibly think that’s right.“Those who have served our nation deserve our support and protection in their twilight years.So, I am therefore pleased to announce that DFID is designing a bespoke program for Commonwealth veterans living below the poverty line.“We’re working with the veterans’ charities to ensure that those who have given so much are looked after to ensure they can live in dignity… It is a win for the developing world and is a win for the UK on an issue the public care passionately about: the welfare of veterans.”Ms Mordaunt will also set out how British aid money will better prepare Caribbean nations for the hurricane season this year.Britain was barred from using its £14billion aid budget to help the British overseas territories destroyed by Hurricane Irma last year due to bizarre international rules that deemed the nations too wealthy to receive aid.But the UK Government forced a change in the rules, set by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it\u0027s always sensible to be open to the possibility of changing one\u0027s mind. But I wouldn\u0027t put money on it,\" he said as we drove out of Dublin to the border.Barely discussed during the EU referendum campaign, the Irish border has become one of the most politically charged and biggest stumbling blocks of Brexit.Both sides agreed in December 2017 \"that the UK remains committed to protecting North-South co-operation and its guarantee of avoiding a hard border\". But they cannot agree on how to go about it.The EU has argued that the island of Ireland should remain in common regulatory area to ensure the free flow of goods, but that implies a border down the Irish sea - an idea Theresa May will not tolerate. Meanwhile, the UK has committed to leaving the customs union and single market, which Brussels says makes leaving the border completely open impossible under EU rules.Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator, is clear that any solution to the border conundrum must respect the integrity of the single market and customs union. Ms May\u0027s red lines cross his.It looks like an impossible circle to square and yet for Mr Rees-Mogg the Irish border issue is simple: the prime minister should unilaterally declare that she will not impose a hard border on the island of Ireland and challenge Dublin to put it up instead.\"I think it\u0027s an obvious negotiating point which is that if you want a border you put it up,\" the chair of the Eurosceptic European Reform Group told Sky News.\"You negotiate with your best cards and you\u0027ve got to call the bluff of the other side when they are suggesting things they simply will not do.\"It\u0027s a game of chicken the Brexiteer is certain London would win, with the prize being no return to a hard border and no need for the UK to remain in some form of customs union with the EU.\"The idea that the Irish government, which used to claim that the whole of Ireland was its territory, would pit a wall up along 300 miles or so of border is, I think, for the birds, and we must therefore challenge that and say, \u0027Go on if that\u0027s what you want to go and do,\u0027\" he added. Mr Rees-Mogg - along with other Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove -- believe Brussels is using the border as a political stick to beat the British government into submission and force it to remain part of the EU market forever more.But the sight of an upper-class Englishman pronouncing on the fragile politics of Ireland from a parliament that sits over 400 miles away undoubtedly grates with many people.His approach to the Irish border was described on Tuesday by Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond as \"ignorant\" \"feckless\" and \"blinkered\" as news emerged of our trip.As a theory it might work, but in practice his proposal is risky and complicated, argue some of those whom he meets on the border. Uncertainty over the Irish border risks disrupting trade and stoking sectarian divisions put to rest through the peace process.John Sheridan, an anti-Brexit sheep and cattle farmer based just north of the border, worries that any change to the status quo could ruin his business. He talks about the spectre of cheap meat from non-EU countries like Brazil and the US flooding the market. He is concerned that the movement of livestock will be disrupted.\"There\u0027s no such thing as a soft border,\" he tells Mr Rees-Mogg as he looks down into the valley where the Irish border winds around his land.\"Because someone will infringe the rules that will put the integrity of Europe on hold and then there will legislation and over the years the soft border will become the hard border.\" \"We use the island as one economic Ireland and nobody wants to take any step back,\" says Mr Sheridan.This 22-year old man, who travels the border everyday for work, wants a border poll to let the people of Ireland decide.\"Political viewpoints are changing,\" he tells Mr Rees-Mogg. \"And I think its probably the right time to call a border poll, in light of Brexit and what\u0027s happening. Let the people decide if they are ready for reunification.\"From Dublin to Brussels, from Brexiteers to Remainers, Mr Rees-Mogg may be right that different parties are using the Irish border problem as a Trojan horse to shape their form of Brexit.Maybe Brussels does want to use it to keep Britain in the single market perhaps republicans will use it to try to reunify Ireland Brexiteers may want to downplay the political intricacies of the border issue to give them they clean Brexit they so crave.Mr Rees-Mogg, standing on the bridge that links Blackloin in the south to the town of Belcoo in the north is still adamant that his solution can, and will, work, if only Mrs May will face down Dublin and Brussels too."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-solent-weather-sun_4347099.jpg?20180627152759 ","title":"new record as heatwave continues to bake parts of uk","story":"Parts of north west England, Northern Ireland and Scotland could reach up to 30C or 31C on Thursday.Britain has been basking in sunshine as a heatwave continues across the country and the fine, hot weather is expected to stay into next month.Parts of the UK are hotter than Athens in Greece, and on a par with Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.The highest temperatures over the next few days are set to be in the north and west, rather than the South East.And there is a chance Northern Ireland will beat its highest-ever recorded temperature of 30.8C (87.4F).

The Charity Commission found the Love Saves The Day Foundation fell short” of transparency, accountability and governance standards, a watchdog found today. Banks - who co-founded Leave.EU, the unofficial Brexit campaign fronted by Nigel Farage, set up the Foundation for “charitable purposes.” But a probe into the charity found a ‘discrepancy’ between what was reported in its accounts and what was shown on its website. The watchdog concluded that there was a serious flaw in the administration of the organisation but said it did not find evidence of misuse of funds.  Mr Banks branded the criticism utter rubbish and attacked the Charity Commission. The watchdog found that the charity\u0027s website risked misleading the public. David Holdsworth, deputy chief executive officer at the commission, said: The public rightly expect high standards of governance, transparency and accountability of charities. The trustees of Love Saves The Day Foundation fell short of these expectations with their inadequate management and administration of the charity. Setting up a charity is a valued responsibility, but not one that should be entered into lightly. Those that run charities must remember that they have important legal duties towards the charity.  The commission began investigating after media reports that the charity\u0027s accounts did not match information on its website. It reported no income or expenditure in the year ending May 2016 but the website said it had made significant donations to a number of projects during that time. The watchdog found that a \u0026pound10,000 windfall was never received by the charity because trustees instructed the donor to transfer the funds directly to another charity. It was told that donations to projects outlined on its website had been made in a personal capacity by a trustee. The commission said it was rightly concerning to the public if charities do not accurately or clearly report what they are doing. Mr Banks questioned why the Charity Commission likes to criticise people like me and suggested that Mr Holdsworth was a Remain supporter.

Olivia, whose daughter is now seven, is a midwife and believes that her terrible experience and recovery have made her more understanding of women who have a traumatic birth. This is Olivia\u0027s story. Four months after I gave birth to my daughter, I was standing in the shower and saw blood gushing down my legs and pouring over my feet. I started to scream, and my husband burst in. He grabbed my arms asking me what was wrong and I couldn’t understand what he meant. I looked down and there was nothing there. No blood, just water from the shower. My heart was pounding and I was shaking so much that he had to help me out. I finally explained to him what life had been like for me since I gave birth to our daughter. When I was 30 weeks pregnant, I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with a very rare condition called placenta accreta, in which the placenta abnormally attaches to the womb. It meant that I was at risk of severe haemorrhaging, which could be life threatening for both myself and my baby. Blood A week later, on the antenatal ward, without warning blood began gushing down my legs and over the floor. I called out for help and lots of midwives rushed in, they got me to the labour ward and ready for an emergency Caesarean. I knew from the way the midwives and doctors were working together, swiftly and efficiently, just how serious this was. All I wanted was for them to save my baby girl. I felt as if I was watching from outside my body. I believed that I was going to die, that I would never meet my baby girl or see my older children again. I said goodbye to my husband, and told him I loved him, and thought it was the last time I would see him. They rushed me into theatre and put me to sleep. The next time he saw me was in the Intensive Care Unit a few hours later. My body looked yellow and waxy he thought I was dead and that he was there to turn off the machines, leaving him with a baby on the neonatal unit whose prognosis was unknown.    However despite losing more than five litres of blood, I was saved by the skill of two brilliant obstetricians and their teams. I had multiple transfusions, and then six days later I was discharged from hospital. Leaving my baby in hospital that day was heart breaking, but after spending 30 days in the neonatal unit,\u0026shy she was able to come home too. Heartbreaking Although my physical recovery went well, the emotional impact hit me hard. I had recurring dreams, in which I saw my husband carrying the smallest white coffin containing her little body and would wake sobbing, sweating and shaking. These dreams sometimes came many times in one night and I would wake in the morning exhausted. I went through the motions of my life but inside a light had gone out. Once my daughter was home, the dreams were replaced by hypervigilance – an extreme alertness. I struggled to go to sleep in case something happened to her. I would just watch her sleeping until I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore. But I would wake with a start and be too scared to look at her in case she had died. The exhaustion continued and I started to feel crazy. If she slept longer than expected I rushed to her bed and when I looked in I would see her dead. I would grab her, startling her, and although she was fine I was left in shock at what I had seen, that had not really been there. Anxiety would grip me and my response would either be tears or rage. I was hard to console because I could not explain what was wrong. Post-natal PTSD affects about 20,000 women a year, after enduring, for example, severe tearing, a haemorrhage after birth or an emergency Caesarean when the baby is in distress. Women with postnatal PTSD often find it difficult to bond with their baby and their relationship with their partner and family tends to suffer. Lack of awareness means the condition is under-diagnosed and undertreated, according to the Birth Trauma Association. Sometimes rage would consume me over the smallest thing. My fight or flight reflex was in overdrive. I was angry with anyone who said or did the wrong thing. People would say to me, “You are so lucky you did not die” or “You are lucky to be here”, and while all of this was true I did not feel lucky. I felt, angry, afraid and alone. My husband knew I was not OK, but when he tried to talk to me I would be angry and defensive. I didn’t tell him what was happening to me in case he thought I was crazy and I tried to hide my behaviour. It was only after the incident in the shower that I was able to tell him what was wrong.  My kind husband took me to the GP and I told her everything. She explained that my flashbacks and anxiety were symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). She referred me for cognitive behavioural therapy – a painful process that involved reliving some of my painful memories, and helping me “refile” them so that they became part of the past instead of something I was constantly reliving. My therapist helped me understand that PTSD can happen to women traumatised by their birth, and that, while I was mentally ill, recovery was possible but I had to work at it. When people hear the term PTSD, they think they know what it is – a mental health condition that soldiers suffer after witnessing horrors of war. No one really believes that it can happen to a woman following the birth of her baby. No one wants to hear this.

Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died in hospital on April 12 2015 after taking eight tablets containing the poisonous Dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo, 31, from Gosport in Hampshire, was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of two counts of manslaughter and one of placing unsafe food on the market. He will be sentenced on Friday. Rebelo admitted while giving evidence during the trial that he sold DNP to Miss Parry.  He told the jury that he included a warning on his website that the substance was not for human consumption. Rebelo\u0027s girlfriend Mary Roberts, 32, was cleared by the jury of one count of money laundering after she was accused of transferring \u0026pound20,000 for and on behalf of Rebelo. Ms Roberts said she had never seen capsules for making pills where she lived and if she had she would have asked her partner Rebelo why they were there. She also said she had taken little interest in asking details of a business Rebelo had set up to sell muscle enhancing supplements and protein shakes. The couple wept in the dock as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with Rebelo asking the judge: Can I see my daughter? Ms Roberts could be heard crying as the couple hugged one another. The jury had begun its deliberations on Tuesday afternoon.  Miss Parry died after taking eight diet pills containing the highly toxic DNP. Her sister Rebecca Parry, now aged 19, said in a statement read out during the trial that she had been focused on losing weight. She noted that in the weeks and months leading up to her death, her sister had struggled more and more with her eating disorder. She said: The diet pills she had taken had made her lose a drastic amount of weight but she still wanted to be slimmer. Rebecca Parry said she left Eloise\u0027s house on April 11 at about 9pm and that her sister, who had been talking about doing a Master\u0027s degree, seemed happy but tired. She had leg pain. Rebecca said: She mentioned a takeaway but I told her not to order one unless she was sure she could eat it.

Alan Graystone, 60, died after pouring petrol over himself and setting himself ablaze just two days after Christmas, the hearing was told. He was discovered on fire by his shocked former partner who had noticed an orange glow outside her Hull home, Hull Live reports. Today, the woman told the inquest into Mr Graystone\u0027s death how the dad-of-four was not shouting or anything when she found him. She said she began screaming, What have you done?, before her ex-partner, who was facing her, fell to his knees and said I love you.  After finding Mr Graystone on fire on the night of December 27, the woman said she and her daughter tried to put out the flames. They used a pot of water and a water-soaked blanket, but the pub landlord was already black all over, the hearing was told. He sadly died at the scene, according to the news site. The coroner today concluded that Mr Graystone’s death was suicide, saying his actions were both premeditated and preplanned. The inquest, held at Hull Coroner\u0027s Court, heard he had left notes before he was discovered in flames shortly after 8pm. In a statement, heard at the court, Mr Graystone\u0027s ex-partner said the couple had been together for a while before splitting up in 2016.  She said they had lived together until 2017 due to the tenancy on the pub, the Blacksmith Arms, they ran together in Witham. Later that year, on December 27, she said an envelope was pushed through her door before she saw an orange glow outside. She then went to the door, moments after Mr Graystone had poured petrol over his body and set himself alight, the inquest heard. “Me and my daughter were in the house and I was preparing vegetables, the woman told the hearing. “My daughter said there was a letter from Alan with USB stick. He said it was all the photos of us. Another envelope was posted but I didn’t read it and heard him at the door.  “I then saw an orange glow through the frosted glass of the front door. I opened the door and Alan was facing me. He was on fire and covered in flames. “He was not shouting or anything. I started screaming and said ‘what have you done? What have you done? “He fell to his knees and I heard him say ‘I love you’.” Mr Graystone’s ex-partner’s daughter also recounted what happened that night, describing how the landlord tried to push himself up. She said: “I saw an orange glow and thought Alan had set the house on fire. Me and my mum opened the door at the same time. I looked to the left and saw Alan covered in flames from his head to his shins. I screamed ‘what have you done?’. “I heard him say ‘I love you’ and he fell to his hands and knees and then on to his stomach. He tried to push himself up and then he held his arms outstretched. “I went to get a bed sheet and wet it before throwing it over him. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion and I couldn’t seem to move my arms and legs quickly enough.”  She said she has still not come to terms with what happened. She said in a statement: “I have never been back to that address and I never will. What I saw that night will remain with me forever.” Mr Graystone\u0027s death came days after he had been arrested over an attack on his ex-partner\u0027s new boyfriend, the hearing heard. “In December my new partner was involved in an incident where bleach was thrown in his face, his former partner said. He had to have an operation and will need further operations. Alan was arrested and bailed, his ex-partner said. “Shortly before he died I saw him parked up at my place of work and he was crying. He said it was not him who did it but hoped I would get fed up of my partner and come back to home. “He said this would be the last time I see him and he would not bother me anymore.” Mr Graystone\u0027s brother, Kevin, had previously told the inquest how Alan had been in a series of failed relationships which made him depressed.

And Fred Howe is no exception. Meeting his cartoon heroes in the flesh is a must-see for the eight-year-old – literally. For Fred was born with a degenerative disease, and he has a bucket list of things he wants to experience before he loses his sight. So, coming face-to-face with Mickey Mouse in Paris was one of the most exciting days of his life. “I want to live here forever,” he squealed. The Mirror told recently how Fred is determined to fill his visual memory bank with incredible sights before facing the “doomsday scenario” of total blindness.  His to-do list includes going up the Eiffel Tower, high-fiving Mickey Mouse, being a zoo keeper for a day, swimming with dolphins and travelling on the Eurostar. His parents are determined to help their “Fantastic Fred” in his quest.  Now, in one whirlwind, bittersweet trip, many of his dreams have come true. He has enjoyed train trips courtesy of Grand Central and Eurostar, climbed the Eiffel Tower, and met Mickey and his pals at Disneyland.  Meeting with the famous mascot left Fred ecstatic. The star-struck youngster asked tentatively: “Hi, Mickey. Can I high-five you?” Mickey nodded but counted out his big white fingers to show Fred that he only has four.  “That’s OK,” Fred shrugged. “You can high-four me instead,” and gave him a huge hug. Fred said of his “fantastic” trip: “I love it here. And we saw Mickey. “That’s not a costume, that was the real Mickey Mouse. It was very fun meeting him. He spent ages with us dancing.”  Fred was joined on his adventure to France by mum Karen Newell, 47, dad Dave Howe, 46, and his sister Eva, nine. The journey from their home in York was sprinkled with magic. As they completed the first leg to London King’s Cross, engine driver Tam Duffy let Fred sit in his seat, before they headed off to the Eurostar.  “Wow, wow, wow,” exclaimed Fred, as security staff allowed him a look at the X-ray monitor. “It’s just like magic and you can see through everything.” Driving through Paris in the car, the Eiffel Tower came into view and we all gasped. All except Fred.  His vision is already very limited, and he couldn’t see it. But when the huge monument is right front of him, he shouts: “It’s shockingly big.” After climbing the tower with his mum, it’s off to Disneyland. In the evening, he’s given front-row seats for the amazing Disney light show.  He throws his hands in the air with joy when Star Wars appears. He said later: “It’s magical, fantastic. I love it here. If this is what happens at Disney, then I don’t ever want to leave.” Fred suffers from a condition called familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, caused by a spontaneous mutation of DNA. “It’s like a spelling mistake in his DNA,” Karen explained.  Fred makes the most of life, though. He uses an iPad with large print at his mainstream school and now has grade two in Braille. He has been trained to use a cane, but he hates it. His parents don’t know when he will lose his sight completely, but “danger times” can be around 11 years old or when he hits puberty.  At present, Fred can only perceive light in one eye. Doctors have warned he must avoid contact sports and are constantly in fear of his retina detaching. “The doomsday scenario is losing his sight completely,” Dave said, wiping away a tear. “But we hope that does not happen for a long time, and the longer it goes on the more we can fill that memory bank.” Karen added: “We are tying to do what we can to enrich his life and cram as much in as we can.” Fred was diagnosed with FVR at three months old.  “It was a huge shock,” Karen said “You have this guilt that you’ve given it to him.” At home, his parents watch his every step, with tape wrapped over every table edge to soften any impacts. Karen said: “We live in constant fear.” She said of Fred’s list: “The reason for doing this was firstly for Fred, but also we want the world to see that kids with sight loss can do anything.” And it’s clear that nothing is going to hold Fred back as he looks to tick off more “must-see” items. “Dolphins are next,” he tells us, beaming with joy. “Then a tropical island.” Huge response to our story on Fred\u0027s condition Fred\u0027s mum and dad said the reaction to their son’s wish list has been “absolutely mind-blowing”. Offers from tourist attractions all over the UK have flooded in since his story appeared in the Daily Mirror.

Janet Alexander, 46, claims her daughter Rose was taken by a stranger during a family holiday to the country in April. The senior charge nurse from Inverness says her youngest daughter was taken while at a supervised kids club at the Royal Wings Hotel in Antalya. After taking her eldest daughter Lois, nine, to a scuba lesson, Janet returned an hour later to discover Rose was missing. A frantic search for the child was then launched and Janet has described seeing staff turn to a woman in a hijab and speak to her in Turkish.  It is believed the ordeal came to an end 40 minutes later when another hotel guest spotted the blonde youngster walking with a woman in a hijab near a main road within the hotel grounds. Janet claims that hotel staff did not even know the girl was gone and when the staff failed to answer any questions Janet took her two daughters to the local police station. After speaking with an on-duty interpreter, Janet says police said they could not look into the matter as Rose was not physically harmed and had been returned safely. The P1 pupil was invited to go for a walk and thought it was okay as she remembered going for outside walks at pre-school.  The mother of two has now opened up about the experience - which she said is the most traumatic of my life. Janet said: I was completely distraught, completely. There was chaos as everybody realised she was missing and started running around and people from around the pool started looking for her. I was really quite frozen with fear. This has been the most traumatic experience of my life. I thought my daughter was either dead or faced being trafficked and abused. People need to realise these staff-led play groups aren\u0027t the safe places we believe them to be. I\u0027ll never trust Thomas Cook again.  Janet is now suing Thomas Cook over the alleged incident. The holiday in April this year was the first ever trip abroad for Janet and her daughters. The family was three days into a week-long break when the incident happened. Janet, a nurse with NHS Highland, remains shaken by the incident and hasn\u0027t been able to return to work due to suffering from extreme anxiety and post-traumatic stress. Janet has voiced her anger at Thomas Cook who she claims have not apologised for what went on.  She said: No matter how much I process things it just leaves me in pieces. I\u0027ve been shaking and in tears ever since it happened - I even struggle to leave the kids at school now. My work, neighbours, family and friends have all been really supportive. Even though they couldn\u0027t do anything, the Turkish police were kind and sympathetic. But Thomas Cook have been a disgrace - they haven\u0027t apologised and have actually gone to great lengths to ignore me. What happened has changed our whole way of living and without even apology it\u0027s like I can\u0027t get closure and don\u0027t know how to heal. Janet has now launched a civil claim stating Thomas Cook failed to respond to repeated calls for help during and after the incident. She hopes the outcome will lead to improved safety standards.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027s christening .  The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will take the service, which will be held at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. The date to pop in your diary is July 9 - but that day is already a very important one for the Queen.  Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen.

Nearly six years ago, Ronald Webb, 75, was found guilty of observing a person engaging in a private act in a Keynsham toilet and served three months in prison. The long-time Twerton resident said he has used bushes to relieve himself since the conviction and ban was issued. However, while in Bath city centre on March 19, Webb had stomach problems and badly needed to go and he used the toilets, reports Somerset Live. He was arrested for doing so and charged with breaching his sexual offences prevention order. A further charge of breaching the notification requirements of his order was applied. Webb, a retired labourer, said he was four days late informing the police that he had opened a new bank account, which he needed to receive his pension. But he admitted both offences at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday (June 19) and received two 28-day prison terms, suspended for 12 months.  He was also electronically tagged and given a two-month curfew, under which he must remain in his home from 6pm until 6am daily. Webb, who maintains his innocence over the original incident, said he\u0027s being treated unfairly and that the curfew forces him to endure stifling indoor heat. I\u0027m not even allowed to go out into my own garden to get fresh air in hot weather like this. It\u0027s like an oven in my flat, he said. I\u0027ve been going in bushes [since being banned from all public toilets across the country]. I\u0027m not beating about the bush, I\u0027m being treated like an animal. A solicitor from Reeds Solicitors represented Webb at his crown court hearing. Somerset Live understands that Reeds advised Webb that the sex offences order which he has been subject to since August 9 2012 breaches his human rights. It effectively precludes you from using any public toilet and I am aware that you suffer from certain medical complaints, Reeds Solicitors told him in a letter.  In those circumstances I would strongly advise you to make an application to amend the terms of the order. If you wish to do so, please telephone this office and make a suitable appointment to see me so that I can start the necessary documentation. Webb, who said he is illiterate, wants to get the terms of toilet ban changed but says he doesn\u0027t have enough money to fight the order in the courts. I\u0027ve tried to get this altered, he said. And I\u0027ve been refused every single time. They keep saying to me that I\u0027ve got to take it back to court, when they know full well that I can\u0027t afford to. All I\u0027m interested in is letting the public know how I\u0027m being treated over this. He added: Can you explain to me where one has got to [go to] use the toilet when he can\u0027t go into a police station, he can\u0027t go to any toilet in Great Britain? If I do it in bushes and a police officer sees me that\u0027s against the law, so where has one got to go? I\u0027m a pensioner and as far as I\u0027m concerned I\u0027m an easy target for them because they know I can\u0027t do anything about it.

Unlike other members of the royal family, they stayed clear of traditional regal names and picked something a bit more unusual. According to the couple\u0027s spokesman, they picked the name simply because it is just a name they liked. But there is actually a lovely meaning behind the name, which is pronounced Lay-na.  Lena is the Greek word for \u0027light\u0027. So far this year it has been the 279th most popular girl name, 15 places up from last year. However it\u0027s far from a modern name, and it was extremely popular centuries ago.  In terms of popularity, it reached its peak in 1885, when about 6,584 of every million babies were given the name, reports parenting website BabyCentre .   She also shares the name with lots of celebs, including Game of Thrones star Lena Headey and American actress Lena Dunham.  The baby girl\u0027s middle name is Elizabeth, which is likely a tribute to her great-grandmother the Queen.  She shares the middle name with her cousin Prince Charlotte. The new arrival, the second royal baby this year after Prince Louis, is the Queen and Prince Philip\u0027s seventh great-grandchild. Little Lena made history by becoming the heaviest ever royal baby, weighing 9lbs and 3oz. She will be a little sister for the couple\u0027s first daughter Mia.  Zara and Mike waited several days to reveal the name, which experts believe is because they needed to tell the Queen the name before they told anyone else. Lena was born at Stroud Maternity Unit in Gloucestershire on Monday, June 18. The royal family released a statement to reveal the news, which read: Mrs Michael Tindall was safely delivered of a baby girl on 18th June, at Stroud Maternity Unit.

For the third consecutive day the mercury hit record-breaking temperatures, with 31.9C recorded in Wales today as the fierce heatwave gripping the UK continues. Forecasters are predicting the record could be broken again within the next 24 hours as temperatures continue soaring, bringing the threat of wildfire, travel chaos and health risks. Porthmadog in north-west Wales today beat the 30.7C (87.3F) recorded in Rostherne in Cheshire yesterday. A spokesman for the Met Office said: The temperature seen at Porthmadog will not necessarily be the highest today but it is the record so far this year.  He continued: Over the next few days the high pressure will remain so there will be blue skies across the UK and that will last certainly into the weekend. We may see some thunderstorms on Sunday or Monday but nothing\u0027s certain. But we can expect these sorts of high temperatures to be reached certainly until Saturday. The sweltering heat hasn\u0027t come without its pitfalls - especially for commuters bracing themselves for yet more chaos as bridges swell and fears rail tracks are buckling under the strain. Gritters and emergency \u0027action teams\u0027 have also hit vital roads and motorways to stop tar melting. Wakefield Council tweeted: If you see our gritters out this afternoon - wave hello! They\u0027re dusting the roads to protect them in the heatwave. Network Rail\u0027s extreme weather action teams are being activated across the country to monitor vulnerable locations and speed restrictions have been imposed, causing delays to services.    Hot weather can cause the steel on rail lines to expand and in some cases buckle, causing travel disruption, Network Rail said. Slower trains exert lower forces on the track, reducing the likelihood of buckling. South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week. Services on the London Waterloo to New Malden line are being subjected to speed restrictions from 11am each day until Friday. Last night, firefighters were called to Barton Swing Bridge in Salford after the structure expanded in the searing heat and failed to return to its normal position. Meanwhile, the Met Office\u0027s heat-health watch alert is currently at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  Public Health England (PHE) has issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable, while the RSPCA is calling on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals. PHE said the over-65s, young children and those with health conditions are the most vulnerable in hot weather, and encouraged people to look out for each other. Dr Thomas Waite of PHE said: It\u0027s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk, and chances are we\u0027ll all know someone, if we\u0027re all going to stay well this summer.  The heat has already claimed casualties - a 1 7-year-old boy was recovered from the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search a rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.   Elsewhere, the search continues for 13-year-old Ryan Evans who has been missing since Monday after getting into difficulty in Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent.  The alarm was raised when he was spotted in distress with two other boys at one end of the lake at around 5pm. The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  Those in the Peak District have been warned to stay away from part of Saddleworth Moor, which has been gripped by wildfire since Sunday afternoon with the army on standby while fire crews battle to bring the blaze under control.

In January this year Cara Droy’s “pretty giant ovarian cyst” had grown to nearly a foot long, from her rib to the pit of her stomach, and weighed almost a stone.  The 29-year-old’s life was turned around when the cyst was found and doctors told her to stay away from the gym in case it burst – halting her strongwoman training, reports the Daily Record .  Cara became weak and was unable to train for competitions as the cyst grew unusually quickly.  She said: “It was painful, like carrying a child near the end. I had irregular bleeding in the New Year and I knew something was wrong, so I had to go to the doctors. “On examination, the doctor said my uterus was inflamed and it was acting like I was having a child. When I received my ultrasound scan I was told that it was the size of a large melon and they would have to operate as it was growing.” Cara, form Hamilton in South Lanarkshire, stopped competing over a year ago as she says she was growing tired of the sport as her strength was dwindling, and that was frustrating. She said: “In hindsight, it’s probably the cyst that caused all the tiredness and weakness as the growth took over most of my core, I just didn’t know it at the time.  “I competed in Scotland’s Strongest Woman in three competitions. I also took part in a couple of power lifting competitions too and made it to a British final. “Back in 2013 I was sitting at nearly 17 stone. I didn’t exercise, I didn’t do anything at all and in a year I changed my life. “ I got down to 12-and-a-half stone and I found that I was pretty strong, probably because of the weight I used to carry around all the time. “I found the sport of Strongman and I just loved it. Weightlifting was like therapy through tough times and I made so many friends.” Cara, a former St Elizabeth’s Primary pupil, had the cyst removed in March along with one of her ovaries and fallopian tube but now, just two months later, she has been diagnosed with endometriosis.  She said: “Two months later, I went back to the doctor for what I assumed was a check-up. I’ve now been told there is a fair amount of endometriosis on my one remaining ovary, an incurable illness which affects one in ten women. “It can create other cysts, seriously affect fertility and cause a lot of pain. It causes a lot of worry for me, that I might not be able to have a family, that I knew relatively nothing about this disease even though it affects ten per cent of women. For the past four months I’ve been pretty tired and weak but my partner Fraser has been really supportive.” The company secretary is now keen to educate others about the affects of endometriosis and plans to take part in the Kiltwalk in Edinburgh on September 16 to raise cash for Endometriosis UK, the charity set up to support women with the condition. Cara said: “Myself and my little mini dachshund Hugo have decided to brave the Kiltwalk in Edinburgh.

Cindie Allen-Stewart, from Texas, would slather herself in sunscreen only to find she was still getting burnt. She tried numerous methods to ease the pain and redness with no luck, until finally trying one her mother-in-law suggested - and now she swears by it. The home remedy treatment, which she has been using for the past 10 years and takes just minutes, involves shaving cream and she says \u0027works wonders\u0027.  In a Facebook post which has since gone viral, Cindie wrote: It takes the heat out of it fast and makes it more comfortable on you. First, buy some Menthol foam shaving cream. It has to be the foam and it has to have menthol in it. We found Gillette shaving cream on Amazon since we had problems finding menthol foam in stores. We ended up buying 6 cans of it, but it works out because we live in Texas and sunburns happen a lot. (Plus, we have given a couple cans to friends.) Next, apply the shaving cream on the burn. It may seem like it\u0027s a strange shaving ritual, but trust me! Don\u0027t rub it in, just let it sit on your skin. It will start bringing all that heat out (you\u0027ll be able to feel it). You may feel like you are itchy too, but that\u0027s a good thing! Itching means healing.  Cindie says after 30 minutes, the shaving cream should have dissolved into spots and feel dried out. You will feel as if you\u0027re becoming a little cold, she added. At least on the sunburned part of your body. THAT IS A GOOD SIGN! Next, rinse it off in a lukewarm or cool shower or bath. It\u0027s just to get the residue off. Finally, if you still need it, do it again the next day. Usually after that second treatment, the sunburn disappears. I use this on my kids too!  Cindie\u0027s mother-in-law learned the method from a doctor 40 years ago and thought it was crazy then too until she saw it in action. Stay-at-home mum Cindie has tried aloe vera in the past but finds the shaving cream works a lot better. She added: I\u0027m not saying to go out and do this, I was just showing my friends what I do. Please remember to always use sunscreen! Too much sun exposure can be dangerous and lead to cancer. By no means am I endorsing going out without sunscreen! I burn with sunscreen as well and know of the hassle, but it is worth it to wear it!

The quintuplets, who were born within three minutes of each other in July 1996, attended the same elementary, middle and high school and even went to prom together. Being accepted to the same university, they shared in the same college houses and revised together in the library in preparation for their final exams.  The quins worked part-time in restaurants, took out student loans and used the university\u0027s financial aid program to put themselves through university. But although the Diazes, of Keller, Texas, shared many core classes, their majors couldn\u0027t be further apart.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Arbroath-Road-towards-the-Kingsway-junction-stock-image.jpg ","title":"dundee council objects to plan to

Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range

willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also

She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job.

I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2cf8557f688-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people student jim 73 gets third degree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStudents of all ages packed out City Square as the Caird Hall hosted the  University of Dundee’s graduation ceremonies.Among those receiving a degree was 73-year-old Dundonian Jim Ashwood, who picked up his MA(Hons) in American History.Lifelong learner Jim was born on Small’s Wynd, which now forms part of the university campus itself.He said he was “absolutely chuffed” to be picking up his third degree.Hilltown mum Fiona Dixon, 47, is one of the university’s first part-time students to graduate with honours after collecting her First Class MA in English and History.Fiona said: “It’s been a brilliant experience.

celtic transfer to southampton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United won’t get their Stuart Armstrong windfall straight away but that will not affect their summer signing programme.The Tangerines are in line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week if the clubs can agree a fee.United were aware of his likely availability during the close season but, given his off-field issues, there was no chance of him being handed a third spell at Tannadice.Monday saw the players start their first full week of pre-season training at their St Andrews base.They are due to see action for the first time tomorrow week in a friendly at Brechin and more games are set to be pencilled in.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32069b78095-490x564.jpg ","title":"football is a labour of love for refreshed dundee united coach craig easton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAnyone who’s come across him down the years will testify enthusiasm has never been an issue with new Dundee United reserve team manager Craig Easton.As far back as when he was part of the youth system he’s now spearheading, Craig’s huge appetite for the game was always apparent.Even he, though, admits a spell out of the game a couple of years back was a perfect reminder of just how good life in football is.It came when financial problems at Torquay United forced him into an unexpected move back to Scotland and left him searching for work.Not content to sit around waiting for his next job, Eastie ended up working in the building trade and admits it was one of the best moves he’s ever made.“I was in England for 12 years and I didn’t even think of coming back up to Scotland to be honest,” he said.“But in football you can’t plan what’s going to happen, especially as a player and then, when I was coaching, I found things could change as well.“I was with Torquay working with the U/19s and college kids. It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.633048.jpg ","title":"michelin dundee in call for more female engineers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEmployees from Michelin Dundee marked International Women in Engineering Day by calling for more women to apply for roles in the engineering field and said a wide variety of careers are available.The firm has 15 female engineers employed in Dundee following the completion of apprenticeships at its training centre.Gill Bannister was Michelin Dundee’s first female apprentice in 1986, when she began a four-year apprenticeship as a maintenance fitter.Ms Bannister said: “I left school with no training but I thought engineering sounded interesting so I applied for a Michelin apprenticeship and against 800 other applicants I was successful.“It has worked out really well for me and I’m glad that I have my Michelin training behind me.“We don’t just train our technicians to work for Michelin, the apprenticeship covers a range of maintenance engineering subjects which are very useful in the wider world too.”Her colleague, Sarah King, has just completed an apprenticeship with Michelin. After concluding her training in May, she now works in a maintenance team supporting machinery across the factory.Sarah said: “I decided to go into an engineering apprenticeship because it is something I have always had an interest in.

But the new buildings really are looking fantastic.”The North East school campus will open on Thursday August 16, while the Coldside Community Campus schools will open the next day on August 17.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b30b48044f4b-914x564.jpg ","title":"united have a keeper in siegrist even if hes signed for the wrong team says ex dundee star konrad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Thomas Konrad urged new Dundee United signing Benjamin Siegrist to make the switch to the City of Discovery – even if it meant joining the wrong club.The German central defender spent two enjoyable years with the Dark Blues from 2014 to 2016 and has just left Swiss second-tier side Vaduz.He spent his two seasons with the Liechtenstein-based club with new Tannadice signing Siegrist and says the Tangerines have got themselves a keeper – though he’d have preferred him to have signed for the Dark Blues instead.Konrad said: “He asked me a lot about my time in Dundee and said United had called him. I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

people that have come through our door since 2013, it is clear that Poppyscotland\u0027 Inverness welfare centre has become an integral part of the area in terms of the help we are giving to members of the Armed Forces community every day.\"With support from expert staff, they can develop a better understanding of what has caused the issues and take the steps necessary to ensure that it does not arise again.\"Poppyscotland estimates that there are around 100,000 ex-servicemen and women living in the Highlands, and the centre is open to all of them.The charity\u0027 chief executive, Mark Bibbey, said: \"Poppyscotland\u0027 aim in the past five years was to set ourselves up as the heart of the welfare service offering in the north of Scotland.\"None of that would have been possible if not for the welcoming atmosphere that this centre exudes, which is down to the fantastic staff and volunteers.\"The centre has been supported by the MacRobert Trust since its opening, and to recognise that fact, Poppyscotland has renamed the facility the MacRobert Centre.The trust\u0027 chief executive, Rear Admiral Chris Hockley,\u0026nbsp said: \"The MacRobert Trust is delighted to have supported the Inverness Centre since its inception and we are particularly pleased about the renaming.\"This enforces our determination to work alongside Poppyscotland to make a real difference to those in our

celebration","story":"PROUD autistic people celebrated diversity in an Inverness park as part of their annual gathering.Autism Rights Group Highland\u0027s (ARGH) Autistic Pride Day brought families and friends together for a picnic in Bellfield Park.Chairwoman of the group, Kabie Brook, wanted to thank everyone for coming along.\"Autistic Pride Day was rather special this year because at ARGH\u0027s request the Autistic Pride Day flag was flown at the Scottish Government HQ, St Andrews House in Edinburgh,\" she said.Mrs Brook believes that it is a day of celebration and a chance for autistic people to show they are proud of who they are.She added: \"It\u0027s also a show of defiance to those who would rather we were ashamed, quiet, or forgotten.\"The group were supported by Tesco who provided craft materials, Ashers bakery who provided a celebration cake and Strathspey Railway who donated a family ticket for the quiz prize.Special speakers provided stories about life with autism and there was a musical performance.It was also a chance for people to design their own \u0027little boxes of awesome\u0027 \u0026ndash positive affirming memory boxes for when people need a little comfort.\"Let\u0027s not forget what Autistic Pride is and why we need it,\" Mrs Brook added.\"We belong to a marginalised minority and are treated appallingly from childhood but we are human, we are valid, we aren\u0027t ashamed.\"A NEW deal for people with autism in the Highlands \u0026ndash placing them at the heart of discussions about their care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or ideas for improvements.She can be contacted by

access","story":"\u0026nbspA COALITION of disability and mobility organisations has called on Highland Council to make Inverness more accessible.The Putting Inverness Streets Ahead manifesto was launched on Thursday.Attended by charity representatives and local councillors, the call was made to make the Highland capital fit for the 21st century.The manifesto has been produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"As \u0026lsquoThe Gateway to the Highlands\u0026rsquo Inverness plays a pivotal role in promoting the region as an attractive place to live, work and visit.\"But a vital element for any successful 21st century Scottish city must be inclusivity \u0026ndash a city that is open and welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city centre streets outside of specified collection times.This was in response to complaints about them being both unsightly and obstructive.Thursday 28 Jun 2018 5:35

It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs.

He is trying to raise awareness of the need for these two groups to be brought together.In his words: “It’s not that these people are not out there, they just don’t know who to get in touch with.”His running partner is Leona, who has Usher syndrome.Ben said: “I’d been a runner for 10 years and I was looking to do something to help others but that also fit into my lifestyle.“When I watched the London Marathon in 2017 I saw people guiding and thought it would be a good thing to get into. But when I tried googling information that’s when I realised there is a shortage of it in Scotland, which spurred me on to create the group.“I initially got in touch with North East Sensory Services (NESS), who paired me up with Leona.“She needed a new guide for last year’s Great Aberdeen Run half marathon.“She’s a really strong-willed individual and has done things like climbing Kilimanjaro.“Talking to her she said: ‘This is something we need in the north-east.’”Ben, through the Granite City Guide Running Facebook page and his sessions, is now trying to expose as many people as possible to what guide running entails and how to get started.However, because of Disclosure Scotland legislation designed to protect vulnerable groups, Ben can’t personally introduce prospective guides with sensory-impaired runners.He aims to do this by eventually becoming affiliated with, for example, Grampian Disability Sport.He said: “I’m a point of contact, to find out about guide running and how to get involved.“The long-term aim is to connect people who want to guide with people who need a guide.“At the moment the page is for advice, information and I put on classes (to demonstrate).“I can then put people in touch with NESS or Grampian Disability Sport (who can partner people up).”Ben wants bodies like Scottishathletics and Scottish Disability Sport to make it easier to partner guides and runners, and he’s building evidence to show there is real demand for it. He added: “One thing I am doing is keeping a record of the people who want to guide and the people who need a guide.“So I can go to Scottish Disability Sport and say: ‘you’ve got X amount of people in the north-east alone who want and need this’.“The Facebook page has 170 people who’ve shown an interest.“I’ve had close to 50 people contact me directly saying they want to be guide runners.“There’s been at least a dozen or so (sensory impaired) people who have said this is something they’d look for.”Ben’s next challenge is to get as many people as possible to join him and Leona in taking part in the Great Aberdeen Run. He’s even encouraging non-sensory-impaired pairs to try using a blindfold to understand the challenges a sensory impairment creates.For more information, visit Granite City Guide Running on Facebook.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12804773.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_220618vanessa_03JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds pay tribute celebration vanessa","story":"NewsHundreds pay tribute at celebration of Vanessa Riddle\u0027s lifeAnd one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsVanessa Riddle\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds came to say goodbye on a day to celebrate a remarkable life. And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads.

They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger.

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716318644,16318418,16317765,16317580,16317292\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since. A number of the team are very familiar with spending time on bikes, however others in the group perhaps less so.\n\u0026ldquoEither way this was a physical and emotional challenge for each and every one of us.\nDescribed as an \u0026ldquoincredibly tough ride by Kevin, the North Coast 500 spans 516 miles across roads around the coastline in the Highlands. The route starts in Inverness, weaves along the west coast to Applecross and then northwards towards the towns of Torridon and Ullapool.\nFrom there, the team ventured to some of the most northerly coastal points in Scotland, passing by Caithness and John o\u0026rsquo Groats before heading south again through Dingwall and back to Inverness.\n\u0026ldquoDay one was probably the most challenging followed closely by day three, Kevin added.\n\u0026ldquoIt included 2,200 metres of climbing, eight hours of riding, and a top temperature of 27 degrees. However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross. This twisting, single-track mountain road is the third highest road in Scotland rising up to 626 metres (2,054 ft) above the sea level. It\u0026rsquos one of the most scenic rides in the world, very similar to the great mountain passes in the Alps, with very tight hairpin bends which switch back and forth up the hillside, with gradients approaching 20 percent.\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest highlight however, and by far the most humbling, has been the generosity of people from far and wide.\n\u0026ldquoWe knew that setting a \u0026pound25,000 fundraising target was ambitious, however we never imagined we would get so close to it, with funds currently around \u0026pound21,000.\n\u0026ldquoEqually the generosity of people along the way and the support they afforded us was incredible.\n\u0026ldquoOn our last day whilst cycling down the A9 towards Inverness we were flagged down as we passed a layby by the owner of the

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.  Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to thank everyone who supported our events."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-mum-recovering-after-losing-feet-to-sepsis","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH mum-of-two\u0026nbspwho cheated death after contracting life-threatening sepsis is now on the road to recovery.  Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.

We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence. We\u0026rsquore committed to minimising our environmental impact and apologise for any inconvenience caused. If anyone has any concerns or queries they can contact us at dunbar.feedback@tarmac  The incident took place when some clinker (nodules of cement) was being loaded into a store.  As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.  Tarmac has sent out a letter to residents and offered to arrange for cars to be washed at the company\u0026rsquos expense.  Additional CCTV cameras have now been installed on site to improve the company\u0026rsquos ability to gain an external view of its operations."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"              A SPECIAL flag to mark Armed Forces Day was raised at Haddington Town House on Monday as East Lothian Provost John McMillan was joined by Lord Lieutenant Michael Williams and members of his cadets.  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.  Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

As South East of Scotland champions, Anderson\u0026rsquos represented the region at the Scottish final and its black pudding fought off all the other regional champions to take the title.  The black puddings from all the regional champions were purchased by mystery shoppers \u0026ndash these included puddings from Largs, Strathaven, Inverness and Kinross \u0026ndash and then put to the test in a final cook-off.

Despite knowing of this conclusion by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) \u0026ndash which had been investigating the council\u0027s pay policy since 2009 \u0026ndash the city continued to fight its female employees, discriminate against them, and rack up costs as it defended the controversial Workplace Pay and Benefits Review (WPBR) which had been put in place to stave off equal pay claims.  The public sector union Unison has now written to current Glasgow councillors, briefing them on the findings of the EHRC investigation ahead of a meeting of the City Administration Committee on Thursday where councillors are expected to confirm the scrapping of the existing pay policy.  Both Glasgow City Council and the EHRC had refused to make the watchdog\u0027s conclusions public, despite freedom of information requests from campaigners. However council leader Susan Aitken is understood to have insisted the findings be released as part of her commitment to negotiate a settlement and end the council\u0027s legal battle with 6,000 of its female workers who have brought equal pay claims.  Read more:\u0026nbspCouncils face paying millions extra to female staff pensions  Glasgow only conceded the claims were valid after a series of reversals in the courts in February this year.  But Scotland\u0027s statutory equalities body, after a detailed, independent investigation, had told the council in 2010 that the pay scheme was invalid and discriminatory.  Part of the investigation looked at the WPBR and whether the council\u0027s scheme breached the 1970 Equal Pay Act.  In reports to the council in January and February 2010, the EHRC said that both the design and the implementation of the pay structure appeared to be unfair to women workers.  The first concluded \u0026ldquoThere must therefore be considerable doubt as to whether the design of the job evaluation system used by Glasgow City Council to underpin its Workforce Pay and Benefits Review complies with equal pay legislative requirements generally but also specifically in relation to Pupil Support Assistants employed by the Council\".  The second report, agreed and went further, stating: \"It is difficult to escape the conclusion that ... payments, which are paid disproportionately to men, are offsetting the loss of bonuses\"  Although the pay review had improved the lot of women workers, it still left them earning less than men in similar roles, and denied them access to supplementary payments which were largely on offer only to men. However Glasgow officials continued to insist the pay scheme treated people equally.  Read more:\u0026nbspGlasgow City Council accused of perpetuating equal-pay discrimination  It is not clear whether the elected council members at the time were informed of the outcome of the 2009 investigation or its potential financial implications.  Unison claims the council should have recognised the Commission\u0027s expertise and worked with it to fix the policy.  Peter Hunter, Unison regional manager for Scotland, said: \"The implications of the EHRC papers are very clear. WPBR is invalid, discriminatory and unsuitable to be relied on. The fact that elected members are only now considering the major implications of an investigation from 2009 to 2011 suggest that governance arrangements have failed.\"  \"Why was the litigation allowed to continue for so many years when the council knew that several independent experts had made such critical findings about the merit of the scheme?\"  GMB Scotland Branch Secretary Rhea Wolfson said: \"The level of knowledge someone at the council had, and did nothing with, is enough to take your breath away. Eight years later here we are, women are still working under this scheme while the council has known for nearly a decade it was discriminatory. It is unbelievable.\"  A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: \u0026ldquoIn 2009 the EHRC had a concern about the terms and conditions of Pupil Support Assistants. This report set out their concerns. After a period of negotiation we reviewed the terms and conditions of PSAs and ensured that they were being paid fairly. The EHRC wrote to us in 2013 confirming they were content with the new arrangements and closing their investigation.  \u0026ldquoEarlier this year, the council\u0026rsquos City Administration Committee took a decision not to continue with litigation and we expect to begin the process of implementing a new pay and grading structure in the coming weeks.  Council leader Susan Aitken said: \"Today, I am bringing forward another paper to the Council to abandon the WPBR, the pay scheme within which discrimination was embedded. I want a commitment from the Council to implement a fair and just pay and grading scheme which pays equally for equal work and which our employees have confidence in.  \"The City Government will continue to work with employee representatives to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of a decade ago and expose ourselves to fresh inequalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"headteachers-disappointed-after-ditching-of-legislation-to-give-them-more-power","story":"              HEADTEACHERS have hit out over a government decision to shelve legislation that would have given them more power.  School Leaders Scotland (SLS), which represents the secondary sector, said an opportunity to drive \u0026ldquosignificant positive change had been lost.  And the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) warned the move to a negotiated future structure \"lacked clarity\"  On Tuesday, Education Secretary John Swinney was accused of the \u0026ldquomother of all climbdowns after shelving his flagship school legislation.  Mr Swinney decided to put his controversial Education (Scotland) Bill on hold because of a lack of parliamentary support.  The Bill was intended to introduce a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter giving school leaders power to set the curriculum, hire staff and control their own finances.  It was also brought forward to underpin new regional bodies set up to support school improvement.  Mr Swinney told the Scottish Parliament he no longer intended to proceed with the Bill for at least a year and instead would \u0026ldquofast-track change in collaboration with local authorities.  However, the agreement with council umbrella body Cosla means there is less certainty over what changes will be made and how the new structures will work.  Jim Thewliss, general secretary of SLS, said: \"We are disappointed in the decision not to legislate in regard of the Headteachers Charter.  \"We felt that empowering headteachers to address issues and opportunities in a manner best suited to the specific circumstances of their school was a powerful way to improve the life chances of Scotland\u0026rsquos young people.  \"We feel that by having proportionate access to the appropriate levers of power headteachers could have driven significant positive change.\"  Greg Dempster, general secretary of AHDS, added: \"There were concerns from primary headteachers about some of the proposals, but it was felt that at least legislation would have given some clarity.  He said: \"The crucial factor as negotiations continue with councils is that we do not add to the burden of bureaucracy facing headteachers because it is already impacting on interest in the job.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum Scotland, also expressed concern.  She said: \"I have received Mr Swinney\u0027s personal reassurance that parental engagement remains a priority for the Scottish Government.  \"While we are disappointed that the parental involvement legislation will not be strengthened and modernised as our review found to be necessary we are hopeful the ongoing local government discussions will incorporate what would have been part of the legislation.\"  A Cosla spokesman said: \"We are pleased that the important role local authorities play has been recognised and that we will retain a central role in the design and development of the curriculum and ultimately the delivery of every aspect of education.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already made education her top priority and the Education Bill was described as the \u0026ldquocentrepiece of their legislative programme."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/848394.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-a-co2-shortage-could-burst-the-bubble-on-scotlands-summer-events","story":"              IT\u0027S the shortage that has had most people baffled - and yet threatens to burst the bubble on summer events, barbecues and parties.  While we produce CO2 when we exhale, the gas used in the food processing and drinks industries is produced as a by-product of the fertiliser industry.  It puts the fizz in beer, cider and soft drinks, helps prolong the shelf life of meat and is seen by some as the most humane way to stun animals before slaughter.  But there is a shortage as a number of European fertiliser plans closed down for routine maintenance while only two of five UK plans are operating and this is having its effect in the food and drink industry.    Ei Group, Britain\u0027s biggest pub group that formerly traded as Enterprise Inns says some outlets are running out of certain beer brands.  And the Glasgow Science Centre has had to cancel its summer show because they cannot get dry ice.  Roger White, chief executive of Irn-Bru maker AG Barr said they were \"very concerned about the supply challenges\" while it had invested in additional CO2 storage last year.    \"That having been said, we are working to maintain and maximise our supply, and as we speak we are taking the steps to ensure we have all the products in the right place,\" said Mr Barr, whose company also produces Strathmore spring water, Rockstar energy drinks and its own brand lemonade, limeade, cherryade and cream soda.  Pig processing plant to suspend production amid CO2 shortage  \"Obviously if the difficulties were to become more acute, or circumstances change it would have a significant affect on our ability to produce. But at the minute with a lot of hard work we are getting through okay and we don\u0027t have any availability issues for customers.\"  Heineken said its CO2 supplier is \u0026ldquofacing a major issue with supply availability in the UK.  \u0026ldquoLike many other businesses in the food and drinks industry, we are affected by this shortage, said the Amstel, Foster\u0026rsquos and Strongbow parent company .    C\u0026ampC Group, owner of Tennent\u0026rsquos and Magners, said the company has reassured its customers that availability of its brands is \u0026ldquocurrently unaffected.  The food wholesaler Booker said it was limiting sales of some lines to 10 cases per customer per day to prevent \u0026ldquosub-wholesaling.  The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, said the move was to preserve availability and satisfied the \u0026ldquovast majority of Booker customers.  Tesco said the CO2 shortage had not resulted in any availability issues on any product lines.  However, Booker\u0026rsquos move follows Scotland\u0026rsquos largest pig processing plant, Quality Pork in Brechin, Angus, suspending its slaughtering process. It carried out its last slaughter on Tuesday due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.    Pete Cheema, chief executive of the Scottish Grocers\u0026rsquo Federation said they were \"concerned\" to hear about the impact of the shortage but that despite that they hoped manufacturers \"will be fair\" with the distribution of any remaining stocks of products such beers, ciders and soft drinks.  The British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) said the shortage of CO2 across northern Europe is \u0026ldquoimpacting a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector.  \u0026ldquoSoft drinks producers in the UK are taking active steps to maintain their service to customers including working with their suppliers to mitigate the impact as well as looking at alternative sources, said BSDA director general Gavin Partington.  The National Farmers\u0027 Union Scotland last week said six days ago that the CO2 issue was not something that had been raised by poultry members.  Now NFUS has called for CO2 supplies to be redirected to abbatoirs to avoid animal welfare issues.  NFUS\u0026rsquos pigs and poultry, and animal health and welfare policy manager Penny Middleton said: \u0026ldquoThe shortage of CO2 is having a critical impact on the slaughter of pigs and poultry, where gas stunning is the preferred method of slaughter for welfare reasons.  \u0026ldquoThe processing plant at Brechin has already announced that it will not be able to take any more pigs from today, a decision that will impact heavily on pig units reliant on being able to get pigs away.  \u0026ldquoAny disruption to that flow can result in welfare issues and overcrowding.  \u0026ldquoGiven the expectation of animal welfare problems on pig and poultry units NFUS feels that it is vital that CO2 supplies are reserved and directed to those plants in need.  According to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) the hot weather is exacerbating the issue and could have a \u0026ldquopotentially huge effect on British food production.  \u0026ldquoThings are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0026rsquot be helping, BMPA\u0026rsquos chief executive Nick Allen said.  The British Retail Consortium (BRC) added: \u0026ldquoWe are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."},{"url":null,"title":"england-flag-to-fly-over-no-10-and-scotland-office-for-world-cup","story":"              The Cross of St George will fly over Downing Street \u0026ndash and the Scotland Office in Whitehall \u0026ndash when England take on Belgium in the World Cup this evening.

It would be a mistake to underestimate quite how serious this is: not only is education one of the Government\u0026rsquos biggest weak spots, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon even publicly requested that her time and record in office be judged on it. When she appointed a political big hitter like Swinney to the post of Education Secretary two years ago, it was a statement of intent. As recently as September last year, Sturgeon was still promising new legislation on education when she outlined her programme for government.  Problems in Scottish education have been thoroughly and robustly debated in recent years. The attainment gap, which is the gulf in performance between pupils from richer and poorer backgrounds, has been well documented. The end of 2016 provided a notable low point, however, when international figures revealed that Scotland\u0026rsquos standards in maths, reading and science were classed as average, which represented further decline. It was disastrous news for the Scottish Government, and demoralising for the nation. It felt like something of a rock bottom it was painful to have confirmation of such a falling performance, and it intensified fears about the future of Scotland\u0026rsquos children.  However, much of the Government\u0026rsquos proposed solutions in recent years for improving matters have been met with dismay. Take standardised testing, for instance. The measure was introduced last year in an effort to assess pupil performance in numeracy and literacy, and mostly tests primary school children. However, critics fear that it could cause undue pressure on pupils and introduce a mood of short-term competition between schools rather than a focus on long term development, despite promises from Swinney that school-by-school data would not be published.  A key part of the currently ditched Education Bill was to give far more power to headteachers over teacher recruitment and budgets instead of local authorities. Again, the Government was met with a barrage of concerns. Teaching union the EIS called for a period of \u0026ldquostability and consolidation and more support for teachers and schools following the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence in 2010. The programme was developed after a consultation in 2002, and new qualifications were later introduced to work more comfortably alongside it. This was a big change to the delivery of education, and the prospect of further dramatic changes after such a short time, at a point where schools are already under substantial pressure, was met with grave warnings by many in the sector.  But the Government wasn\u0026rsquot entirely without support. The Scottish Conservatives became the only party willing to get on board with it in principle \u0026ndash the prospect of transferring control from local government directly to schools is more ideologically in tune with the Tories\u0026rsquo way of thinking \u0026ndash which was never a comfortable position for the SNP. When the SNP is battering the Tories at Westminster at every opportunity, it was always going to be politically problematic to rely on the party in Scotland to get through its flagship education reforms. If Sturgeon\u0026rsquos legacy is resting on education, it\u0026rsquos unlikely she\u0026rsquod be keen on thanking the Tories for helping to shape it.  And so here we are. Swinney hopes the public will believe that the Government doesn\u0026rsquot really need the legislation anymore because he\u0026rsquos had a word with local authorities and they\u0026rsquove decided between them that they can just \u0026ldquofast track a number of changes without the need for all that parliamentary time wasting. That\u0026rsquos only credible if he really expects people to believe that Sturgeon installed one of her top people in one of the most important roles of her Government only in order to have a word with local councils.  What it really means is that the Government, at least to some extent, is going back to the drawing board. While this is politically humiliating, it will be met with a sigh of relief from campaigners and others opposed to the approach, who will now hope that the Scottish Government has a radical rethink about how to fix its education nightmare.  But it\u0026rsquos halfway through 2018 and the Scottish Parliament goes into recess this week. Time is running out for the SNP to demonstrate enough visible progress in education before the next Scottish elections, and make no mistake: if Nicola Sturgeon wants to be judged on education, her opponents at the ballot box will be relentless in attacking her over a failure to deliver results.  So it was interesting, this week, to see Sturgeon make such sweeping changes to her Cabinet while Swinney tried to quietly retire one of the biggest legislative priorities of the Government. It\u0026rsquos not only in education that Sturgeon\u0026rsquos Government has problems the now former health secretary Shona Robison, for example, had been tipped for some time to be on the way out following criticisms of NHS performance. She\u0026rsquoll be replaced by Jeane Freeman, a rising star of the party who was previously trusted with the social security brief despite only being elected in 2016. Indeed, it was a good day for rising stars, including big names like Humza Yousaf, who found themselves promoted.  Sturgeon may be hoping that a shake up of the Cabinet will play well for the party as it gears up for Brexit and the next Scottish elections in 2021, although it did come as a surprise to see the newly elected deputy leader of the party, Keith Brown, leave his post as Economy Secretary \u0026ndash it seems peculiar, despite the official line that he needs to focus his efforts on party business.  Swinney, however, remains in his brief. To move him out of education, effectively admitting a massive failure, would have been unthinkable. It would have been humiliating for the Government, and it would have caused real damage to Sturgeon\u0026rsquos leadership.  The SNP hierarchy may be hoping they get away with their big education climb down, but it\u0026rsquos an open goal for the opposition unless the Government can pull something amazing out of the bag in a short time. If not, Sturgeon\u0026rsquos 2015 plea to be judged on education may severely haunt her at the ballot box. Be careful what you wish for."},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-cant-lick-it-taking-the-hat-and-winging-it","story":"              Can\u0027t lick it  WHO doesn\u0027t want an ice cream in this sunny weather?

Well, Melvyn Bragg, (not in so many words) in declaring Britain to be \u0026ldquoa stupid country.  Now, should we believe the Radio 4 presenter simply because he can leap from talking about the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire one minute to the understanding of the proton in a heartbeat? You bet. Because Bragg isn\u0026rsquot bragging from the vantage point of a higher intellect. He\u0026rsquos summing up the growing fear of a growing nation of non-thinkers.  The evidence is in our faces and Facebook pages. We used to ridicule the Santa Ponsa restaurants which put pictures of food in their windows. Now we live in a world of posing, pouting young people who take pictures of their dinner.  We live in a world where 25 per cent of young Scots are classed as \"extreme users of social media,\" which the Government\u0027s Information Commissioner is now investigating.  Meanwhile, video games are shrinking their brains. A new study by the University of California reveals the impulsive part of the brain (the amygdala-striatal system) which video games rely upon, is not only more sensitive but also smaller in excessive users.  Koko the gorilla died last week in California, and decades-long studies revealed he had an IQ of around 90, which is close to some humans. But it\u0026rsquos not surprising the primates are catching up when you learn one-in-five young Scots wake up during the night to check their phone.  One study by British scientists found IQs have started to fall by seven points per generation after having risen every decade since the Second World War. And technology is one of the reasons why.  Clever people are continually coming up with ways to make the rest of us dafter. The more we ask Alexis and co to play us a song, the less we have to think.  Smart gadgets mean we don\u0026rsquot need to switch on the light, or use a map to find our way around. We can ask Google almost anything. We love Twitter because it\u0026rsquos brief and we even text less now. We send emojis. Pretty soon we\u0026rsquoll go back to communicating in sign language. But by that time, the apes will be using our iPads.  Soon we won\u0026rsquot need to think to drive cars.

(Here\u0026rsquos a general rule of thumb if you have breasts, and you\u0026rsquore a man, pull on the trainers and T-shirt.)  Writer/historian/former editor of the New Internationalist, Graham Hancock has long argued we have devolved over the years, given less need to think on our feet. Where man once built perfectly measured pyramids with keen eye and sharp imagination, we can\u0026rsquot get the same results today even with a theodolite.  Devolution seems to be evidenced in our TV output and while Melvyn Bragg points out there has been some great TV this year, including Patrick Melrose (Sky) and A Very English Scandal (BBC1). (And he\u0026rsquos correct populist entertainment can also be very clever. ) But he points out little else matches up. The correlation of this is the recognition of the inane predictability of drama such as Dr Foster or recent divorce series The Split. (Both insulting to women.)  Lord Bragg does say he\u0026rsquos yet to watch Love Island but when he does view this Bikini and Budgie Smugglers Show it will indeed highlight the vacuity of the format and those who take part. Yes, it\u0026rsquos can be fun, and when one young lady said she didn\u0026rsquot know what Brexit actually meant, that was understandable given Theresa May doesn\u0026rsquot either. But what\u0026rsquos tragic is the most popular programme in the country right now mostly features the hard of thinking. And watching the show suggests we\u0026rsquore becoming as dim-witted as them.  There\u0026rsquos also an argument we\u0026rsquore producing more clever young people given the huge rise in Firsts handed out by universities this year. But as Herald writer Rosemary Goring pointed out this is a deliberate strategy by universities to manipulate results to make their courses more attractive.  The reality is Bragg is right. For \u0026ldquostupid you can also read \u0026ldquofrivolous or \u0026ldquofatuous. That\u0026rsquos why we need to encourage learning. We need to encourage discussion, and not by text or Snapchat.

A new \u0027Culture Czar\u0027 position, proposed in the Scottish Government\u0027s new Culture Strategy, would be one of the most powerful and influential cultural figures in the nation.  The \"cultural leadership post\" would advise ministers on cultural matters, as well as guide the strategy plan to see culture as a \"central consideration across all policy areas\".  The role, yet to be officially titled nor its parameters detailed, will be comparable to the Chief Medical Offer in health policy, or the Lord Advocate to the courts, insiders said.  The position would be \"supported by strategic thinkers from across the culture sectors\".  One senior source said: \"This position will help ensure that culture is embedded in all policies.  \"There is a role for a senior role advocating for culture - just as there are similar roles elsewhere in government.\"  It is unclear how this post would interact with the Culture Secretary - a position currently held by Fiona Hyslop - or the senior management of Creative Scotland, which is the nation\u0027s main arts funder.  Creative Scotland was set up as an \"arms length\" body, so that Government would have no role in individual funding decisions.  The new role is a key part of the new Cultural Strategy, which its authors hope will mean culture is considered a key and pervasive part of Government decision making in the future.  The strategy document has now been published and a public consultation will run for 12 weeks until September 19.  This is not the first National Cultural Strategy published in Scotland.  In 2000 the then-Scottish Executive launched a strategy which \"celebrated excellence\" and also emphasised the social benefits of cultural funding.  In 2003, the First Minister Jack McConnell also set out an \"arts for all\" vision in a St Andrew\u0027s Day address, in which he said culture was \"pervasive and fundamental\" to society.  Some artists and others within the cultural world have expressed unease over a direct government intervention in culture in the form of a strategy.  It is also understood that there were initial misgivings in government over how a culture strategy could have concrete recommendations, when the Scottish Government is keen to not give the impression of meddling with artists and their work.  The document says it believes culture should be \"free to be inspiring, disruptive and plural.\"  The strategy has already had a long period of consultation, including with cultural figures at a meeting in Glasgow.  The draft says that the Scottish Government \"has levers and responsibilities that it can deploy to support culture, such as: taking an overview of national ambitions, outcomes and priorities and working towards an overall vision for society in Scotland\" as well as \"articulating a national and international outlook which has the ability to influence.\"  Sir James MacMillan, the Scottish composer, said on Twitter: \"A cultural leadership role in Government is not required and smacks of one voice nationalism.\"  He also said the cultural strategy was \"facile and pointless\".  The Scottish Government document says the strategy will lead to \"long term change through greater collaboration and integration across culture, communities and policy development.\"  The document says that culture is \"central to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural, social and economic prosperity.\"  It also details how the government will commit to \"exploring new funding models to support the culture sector and to develop the creative economy that includes new partnerships and examining the potential of Scottish Government powers such as budgets, Scottish National Investment Bank, devolved tax and legislative powers that will generate a collective responsibility to supporting culture in the long term.\"  The strategy document also looks at the issues facing the largely freelance \"cultural workforce\".  A statement by Creative Scotland said: \"We are particularly pleased to see an emphasis on achieving long term change through collaboration across different areas of society and different areas of Government policy.  \"The emphasis on equalities, diversity and inclusion is also significant in terms of how we all provide support for artists, cultural organisations and communities in order to see Scotland\u0026rsquos culture continue to thrive.  \"Creative Scotland will consider the draft strategy and respond.\""},{"url":null,"title":"time-running-out-for-uk-to-reach-withdrawal-agreement-by-october-says-varadkar","story":"              The Taoiseach has warned time is running out for Britain to seal a withdrawal agreement with the EU by October.

The change would mean people would be assumed to have consented to their organs being used to help others unless they had signed an opt-out, potentially increasing the number of organ transplants that can take place in Scotland each year.  The proposed new system also includes protection for adults without capacity to understand, adults residing in Scotland for less than 12 months and children under 16, who will only be able to donate if they, or someone on their behalf, explicitly authorises it.  The Scottish Government announced plans for the new \"soft opt-out\" system last year after a public consultation revealed 82% backing for the change.  Committee convener Lewis Macdonald MSP said: \"There is no doubt that increasing the number of organ donations and having fewer people dying whilst waiting for a transplant is something we all want to see happen.  \"However, this is a complex and difficult issue and there has been much debate and discussion about the most appropriate system for organ donation in Scotland and indeed the rest of the world.

A UK-wide poll found 78% of 18 to 24-year-olds would choose \"bricks over clicks\" when buying goods, stating the town centre as their preferred shopping environment.  This compares with 55% of over-45s who said they find going into town appealing.  The YouGov research, commissioned by Colliers International, found many shoppers would like to see their favourite online store open physical outlets in their local area.  Young people would most like to see fashion brand ASOS open a shop in their neighbourhood, while older shoppers favoured Amazon.  In Scotland, 27% of those surveyed would welcome a branch of Amazon to their local high street, and 20% would like to see an ASOS store.  Just over a quarter (27%) of Scottish respondents said they buy groceries online - the second lowest after Yorkshire and Humberside.  John Duffy, a director for Colliers in Scotland, said: \"Retailers still want a store network, and shoppers still want to go and feel the goods.  \"I certainly think that more online retailers will be tempted to establish a physical presence, perhaps with a few flagship stores in premium locations as we have seen with fashion retailer Missguided.  \"The vast majority of shopping is still being done in person in the UK. The biggest difference the internet has made is that whereas national chains previously wanted 600 or more stores to give them full coverage, now they can make do with 400 and a good online presence.\"  Shoppers in Scotland were identified as the most willing of all the regions to pay more for ethical items and back independent restaurants.  The poll of 3,081 people, including 264 in Scotland, found 64% of Scots would happily pay more for items with a proven ethical or environmental benefit, compared with 54% across the UK.  When asked what they wanted to see more of in their shopping streets and malls, 53% named independent restaurants, compared with 45% UK-wide.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.

And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings.

We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers. It’s a very busy few days for our producers, but always worth the effort and it also gives us an opportunity to tell the wider story about Orkney and all its other attractions.”Amongst the Orkney businesses travelling to the show will be newcomers, J. Gow Rum, makers of the county’s first locally produced rum.Collin van Schayk of rum producers, VS Distillers, said: “We’re very much looking forward to introducing J. Gow Rum to the visitors at this year’s Royal Highland Show. The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Thursday 28 Jun 2018 5:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This is the iconic Scottish ferry firm whose captains would be treated like \u0026#8220pop stars\u0026#8221 in the far flung towns and villages where they provided lifeline links. David MacBrayne, forerunner of CalMac, was an institution at the heart of island life on Scotland\u0026#8217s West Coast for the best part of a century. And now many lost tales and vignettes of its halcyon days  have been saved for posterity with a new book. Christie Boy \u0026#8211 A MacBrayne\u0026#8217s Man is the life story of the late company stalwart Chris Fraser, which offers a peek below decks at some of the hairier moments of the firm\u0026#8217s history. And far from a prosaic record of three decades on the waves, this is a soul-stirring elegy to a forgotten Highland way of life, festooned with a colourful array of West Coast characters. \t\t\t\tFrom starting out in 1928 as a manifest clerk on the Mallaig and Portree steamer, the Glencoe, to his ascent up the managerial ranks in the 1960s, serving across the North West from Inverness and Lochboisdale, Fraser’s story has been revisited and revised by son Kit, 23 years after his father passed away. A book of memoirs had previously been published a year before his death.            “The original edition of Christie Boy stemmed from the family’s determination that his many written memories of a Highland way of life long gone and his entertaining tales of West Coast characters should not disappear with him,” says Fraser junior, the former BBC Scotland Drivetime presenter.            “Nearly a quarter of a century later, I realised the case for publishing Christie Boy was just as strong today as it was in the 1990s.”This was a different era, when large families were the norm and parents devoted their lives to bringing up the brood. Fraser was one of nine siblings growing up in remote Lairg in Sutherland. Another two brothers died in childbirth. “Mam” made much of the family’s clothing, while most of the food supplies were grown locally or in nearby crofts. Strict observance to the Sabbath and barefoot summers were the order of things. Fraser was just 15-years-old in Storme Ferry, Ross-shire, when he was recruited to work on the Glencoe and was soon to discover a new world of personalities aboard the firm’s fleet of steamers. These vessels were daily staples for residents of Scotland’s West Coast islands at the time and included the Plover on the Outer Islands, the Glencoe on the Portree service, the Claymore on the North Mainland and the Lochinvar on the Sound of Mull. The Pioneer was a familiar name on Islay, with the Columba servicing Ardrishaig, while the Caledonian Canal had the Gondolier and the Crinan Canal, the Linnet. Short cruises out of Oban were provided by the Mountaineer.“Every ship had a few special characters who were out of the ordinary,” Fraser recalls.“No matter where members of the company met, one could be sure that sooner or later the gathering was going to hear a feast of stories, some witnessed at first hand, others handed down.”Among those were of Plover Captain Duncan “Squeaky” Robertson, so called on account of his high-pitched twang. Caught in a storm, and feared lost at sea after witnesses reported her having disappeared below the waves during a storm-ravaged trip from Harris to Loch Maddy, the ship limped unannounced into Kyle a day later. Several ventilator trumpets and ladders were missing, its funnel caked in salt and heavy damage abounded.            “We had a bit of a breeze,” Squeaky remarked to stunned port office staff on arrival. These are the escapades of a bygone era, where notions of health and safety seemed to stretch little further than managing to stay alive. And often barely so. The unfortunate “Big Donald” had perhaps the closest escape while fishing in a boat off Kyle. The setting sun meant the approaching Lochness steamer failed to spot him and he was duly run over and his boat sunk. It was only as crew were tidying up the mooring ropes after some distance they heard his cries for help – and he was spotted in the water “hanging on grimly” to the ship’s anchor before being pulled aboard. One shudders to think what kind of payout the firm would face nowadays from an inevitable lawsuit.A wooden fishing drifter enjoyed a similar lucky escape on a blustery night in Portree harbour when the approaching Fusilier caught a sudden violent gust which saw the steamer slice almost right through the middle of the smaller vessel stopping just short of her funnel. Rather than halting to inspect the damage, the ship’s captain Lachie Robertson instead forged ahead to his berth, with the stricken trawler wedged into the ship’s bow. It meant the fishermen were able to abandon their vessel by climbing onto the pier. And in an age before computerised instruments and GPS, the aforementioned “Squeaky” won the admiration of dockers after he made harbour in dense fog having negotiated the “narrows” at Kylerhea. It was all down to a shepherd gathering sheep on the bank who could see the ship’s mast above the fog and kept calling out “You’re doing fine Duncan – just carry on.”            And who better to solve the mystery of Nessie than captain Peter Grant who sailed the dark waters of Loch Ness for 20 years. He never saw any monster but suggested a flight of ducks just above the surface in cloudy weather could give this  illusion. The unfortunate stoker of the Plover, a chap called McDiarmid, became the butt of fun as he left the Kyle Hotel one stormy night to have his hat blown off by a mighty gust – which also captured his wig. When the landlord was later asked by new patrons if there was anything good to drink, he was able to offer the reassurance  that his fare was so strong it blew a man’s wig off earlier in the evening. The upheaval and change among the fleet and at the firm are covered, including the departure of David MacBrayne himself in 1928. His name had fronted the firm since 1878 when he gained full control and changed the name from David Hutcheson \u0026amp Co which had been established in 1851. It was to last almost a century before the Caledonian MacBrayne name emerged. The patriarch left behind a staff to whom the firm had “become a way of life,” the author laments. “It is perfectly true that to be a member of the company earned anybody a welcome wherever they appeared in the West of Scotland.”The transformation of the Highlands after the outbreak of the Second World War is also set out, with journeys home to Kyle requiring special authorisation as the area had become a naval base with entry heavily restricted. There are stirring tales of Fraser’s frontline experience in North Africa and the British reverses at the hands of Rommel, before the dramatic upturn with the arrival of Field Marshall Montgomery and his defiant “no retreat, no surrender.”             A spell as an intelligence officer in the Italian campaign followed as the Germans were driven out of the country. Fraser ended up on Orkney for perhaps the most bizarre war victory celebrations after the Japanese surrender. A botched attempt at a victory bonfire resulted in near volcanic tar flows and much of the Kirkwall foreshore was subsequently engulfed in flames. Fraser returned for a new post-war chapter with MacBrayne’s taking on the role of port manager in various “relief roles” around the North-West before becoming Northern area manager. But problems with industrial relations and rivalries within management eventually took their toll and after 33 years’ service, he and wife Rena, along with children Beatrice and Kit, opted for a new quieter life at the sub-Post Office of the “sleepy railway junction” of Aviemore. With the revolution in Scotland’s outdoor and skiing industry poised to descend on the town, the tranquillity was not to last. Christie Boy – A MacBrayne’s Man is available from Amazon, £8.

A Wetherspoon spokesman said some pubs would be without John Smith’s and Strongbow cider but said that supplier Heineken had advised both would be available again in a couple of days.            He said: “Wetherspoon has the advantage that it sources its wide range of drinks from a number of suppliers, so has not been too badly affected.“Heineken has been the company with the biggest issues and they have told us that all is getting back to normal.”Punch Taverns, which has around 1,300 pubs, said it has had shortfalls of John Smith’s and Amstel for almost a week, with Birra Moretti also now in short supply.A spokesman said: “We are working closely with suppliers to ensure that alternative products are available and we continue to communicate with our publicans to minimise any disruption. We are hoping that product availability will be restored within the next few days.”A Heineken spokeswoman said: “We’d like to reassure beer drinkers that all our breweries are operating at full capacity, and we’re working 24/7 to get beers to our customers as quickly as possible.”            READ MORE: Pork shortage looms as major pig abattoir closes due to CO2 deficitEi, the UK’s largest pub group which runs the Craft Union and Bermondsey Pub Company chains, said: “We are aware of the issue relating to a shortage in the supply of CO2 and are working with our suppliers to minimise any disruption to our customers and our publicans.”The Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) visitor attraction said it had been unable to get the dry ice it needed for its new show due to the European shortage of CO2.Resident scientist Sam Langford said: “Here at GSC we use carbon dioxide in its solid form in our science shows to demonstrate a number of scientific phenomena, including sublimation, ocean acidification and the three states of matter.            “However, recently we’ve had some trouble obtaining dry ice from our suppliers due to a European shortage of CO2.“Our plans for our brand new summer show have been put on hold.“Whilst this is a small problem for GSC, dry ice and other forms of CO2 being in short supply is a major problem for a number of industries for whom it is an essential product.”Food wholesaler Booker said it was limiting sales of some lines to 10 cases per customer per day to prevent “sub-wholesaling”.The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, said the move was to preserve availability and satisfied the “vast majority of Booker customers”.            A Booker spokeswoman said: “Due to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. We are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers.”Tesco said the CO2 shortage had not resulted in any availability issues on any product lines.However, Booker’s move to ration sales followed Scotland’s largest pig processing plant suspending its slaughtering process, Coca-Cola temporarily pausing some production lines and Morrisons and Ocado telling customers that the shortage had led to disruption to some frozen product lines.Quality Pork Limited in Brechin, Angus, carried out its last slaughter on Tuesday due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.There are plans to send around 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say the CO2 shortage could have serious implications if the shortage continues.British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said the situation was getting “pretty tight”, exacerbated by the hot temperatures.Mr Allen said: “The frustration is the lack of information. We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.“Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won’t be helping. If things don’t alter this week, we’re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.”Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a “potentially huge effect” on British food production.A spokeswoman for the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said CO2 supply issues remained and retailers and suppliers were working hard to ensure food availability was maintained.The BRC said: “We are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages.“However, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected.”The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the “worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the British Medical Association yesterday issued new calls for a referendum that supporters claim could keep the UK in the EU.            On Saturday, 100,000 people protested outside Westminster to demand a vote on the Brexit deal, despite the Government’s insistence that it will not allow one to take place.Mr Blackford suggested any ‘People’s Vote’ would have to be tied to a second independence referendum in case the rest of the UK chose for a second time to leave the EU, taking Britain out of the single market and customs union.He said securing indyref2 came ahead of any vote on the terms of Brexit in the “ranking choice in terms of what our preference would be”.And as Nicola Sturgeon assembled a new government in Edinburgh, her leader at Westminster said: “We must not lose sight of the option of having an independence referendum.”Mr Blackford said: “What we’ve said is that if there was a proposition for a [second EU] vote, of course we wouldn’t stand in the way of that.            “What I would say, though is that we already have a mandate from the people of Scotland and the Scottish Parliament, if there is a change in circumstances, that we should have a discussion with the people of Scotland and a vote on independence.“If we were talking about a ranking choice in terms of what our preference would be, it would very much be a decision of the Scottish people on our constitutional future, rather than anything else.“If we are faced with a second EU vote, it’s about how Scotland’s position is respected within that. For example, if we end up in a situation where the rest of the UK voted no again, but Scotland voted to Remain, how is our position respected?”The SNP MP added: “In a situation where we were dragged out of the single market and the customs union against our will – and we’re talking about a material change in circumstances, the phrase that was used in the manifesto in 2016 – then we must not lose sight of the option of having an independence referendum.”            At the weekend, Mr Blackford said the SNP had an “open ear” to calls for a referendum on the UK’s Brexit deal.Ms Sturgeon has said she will reveal whether the Scottish Government will restart demands for a second independence referendum “once we get some clarity” on the detail of the UK’s exit deal, likely in the autumn.Her cabinet reshuffle this week saw newly-elected SNP deputy leader Keith Brown leave the government to focus on preparing for a future independence campaign.Supporters of the People’s Vote campaign believe momentum is growing for the public to have the final say on the deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels.In a speech at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank on Wednesday, Mr Blair warned that paralysis over the type of Brexit the UK should seek risked plunging Britain into the politics of the 1930s.            “Parliament must assert itself because neither government nor opposition can or will,” Mr Blair said. “Then the people must make the final decision because only they have the right to decide what version of Brexit they want or whether in the light of all they now know they prefer to remain.” He suggested the Brexit date should be delayed.Also on Wednesday, the BMA passed a motion at its UK annual conference warning Britain’s departure from the EU poses a “major threat” to health and calling for a referendum on the terms of Brexit.The Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives have also recently supported calls for the public to have a final say on the Brexit deal.Meanwhile, at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mrs May came under fresh pressure over Cabinet battles on Brexit that have increasingly moved into the open.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed the Prime Minister was having to “negotiate round the clock” with her own ministers to prevent the government from collapsing.Today’s European Council summit in Brussels is expected to give little time to Brexit, with EU states focusing on migration and Russia, though leaders of the remaining 27 members will receive an update on negotiations in Mrs May’s absence tomorrow.All eyes are now on a Cabinet awayday at Chequers at the end of next week, at which the Prime Minister aims to finally secure Cabinet backing for her vision of the UK’s future relations with the EU.The plans, covering issues such as trade and security, are due to be set out in a long-awaited white paper next month, which is expected to outline in detail how the Prime Minister sees the UK engaging with the single market and customs union.Fresh from having his job beefed up with a seat around the Cabinet table, the Scottish Government minister responsible for the constitution and Brexit, Michael Russell arrived in London for talks between the UK and devolved governments about the white paper, but said the meeting was a “deeply unsatisfactory experience”.Mr Russell suggested the trip had been a waste of time, telling journalists: “I don’t know much more now than I did when I got out of my bed this morning.” He said: “I have to report that we have not seen a single word of the white paper today. If you have a ministerial forum to discuss the white paper, you would expect there would be a piece of paper.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760548.1530094763!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp rising stars handed key government roles","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tA tranche of rising stars of the SNP have today been appointed as junior ministers by \u0026#160Nicola Sturgeon as she completed her cabinet reshuffle.\t\t\t\tSeven MSPs who were only elected in the 2016 Holyrood election have been promoted to Government posts, including one new minister in her 20s and two in their early thirties.

Jamie Hepburn takes on a new, expanded portfolio of Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills. Paul Wheelhouse stays at energy but with a new focus on the islands.            Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: “In Nicola Sturgeon’s government, it’s harder to avoid a ministerial brief than to land one. The few who’ve been left out must wonder what on earth they’ve done wrong.“The SNP repeatedly brags about being transparent, responsible with taxpayers’ cash and quite unlike any other government that’s been before.The events of the last few days prove that to be nonsense.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4760309.1530088555!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin reshuffle was long overdue but when it came it was dramatic","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tNicola Sturgeon\u0026#8217s reshuffle may have been a long time coming, but when it did come it was nothing if not dramatic, writes Tom Peterkin\t\t\t\tSix ministers have gone and there is the possibility of more casualties tomorrow when the First Minister finalises her junior ministerial team.            In the relatively brief history of devolution, one has to go back to Jack McConnell’s reshuffle of November 2001 to find one of comparable ferocity. Then, five senior and two junior ministers went in a reshuffle that earned the then Labour first minister the nickname “Jack the Knife”. Mr (now Lord) McConnell wielded the axe within hours of taking the top job. In contrast, it has taken Ms Sturgeon months, if not years, to carry out a similar exercise.            Yesterday’s reshuffle was long overdue. For many months now a somewhat tired-looking ministerial team had seemed to struggle to get a grip on domestic issues. In some ways that feeling of drift was typified yesterday with the Scottish Government having to deal with news on cancer waiting times and Education Secretary John Swinney shelving key education legislation.As Ms Sturgeon’s right hand man, Mr Swinney was always going to be safe from yesterday’s blood-letting. The same was not true of her good friend, Health Secretary Shona Robison. Ms Robison has been a lame duck struggling to swim against a tide of poor NHS performance indicators. As was clear from her resignation letter, Ms Robison has also had some very difficult personal issues to contend with. In those circumstances, it is perhaps easy to understand why she would want some time away from the pressure cooker environment of Cabinet politics. Ms Sturgeon will be sad to see the departure of one of her oldest friends in politics. But the truth is a fresh face is desperately needed at what is always one of the trickiest portfolios for a government.• READ MORE: Scottish Government Cabinet Reshuffle: Who’s in and Who’s out?            All sorts of spin can be spun about Keith Brown moving into an enhanced depute role with the SNP, but the reality is that Scotland’s economic growth is still lagging behind the rest of the UK. Mr Brown is a casualty of the decision to put his brief under Finance Secretary Derek Mackay’s umbrella – a change that seems entirely sensible. Angela Constance’s departure is perhaps not unexpected with her post going to former public health minister Aileen Campbell. Of the promotions, Humza Yousaf faces a tough job as Justice Secretary. That is clear given the challenges that Michael Matheson has faced, having to get to grips with the dysfunctional nature of Police Scotland. Mr Yousaf has shown himself to be a politician of determination in his handling of the notoriously tricky transport brief – which now goes to Mr Matheson, who remains in the Cabinet. Jeane Freeman, who in a previous life was a Labour adviser, has long been seen as a politician destined for the Cabinet. She has the unenviable task of taking over the health brief that always proves so difficult no matter who is in charge.             So far Ms Freeman has proved herself relatively sure-footed, aside from an episode last year when she was accused of making a clumsy attempt at smearing a nurse in a TV debate.The return of Michael Russell is an indication of Brexit looming on the horizon, while Shirley Anne Somerville faces the intimidating task of setting up Scotland’s social security system."},{"url":null,"title":"world s first hydrogen ferry to be built in scotland","story":"\t\t\t\tFerguson Marine Engineering Limited successfully led a European consortium bid that has been awarded €9.3m (£8.19m) to support the construction and launch of a sea-going car and passenger ferry fuelled by hydrogen.
