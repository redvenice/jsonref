By the time Meghan had become a senior royal, the pair were still no closer than before the 2018. According to one source, Meghan was disappointed that they hadn\u0027t bonded, but was not losing sleep over it.    The book also details one awkward moment at Kensington Palace in 2017 when Kate went alone in her Range Rover while shopping - despite  the fact Meghan was also going to the same street. Though some aides claimed the sisters-in-law \u0027talked and texted regularly\u0027, they had barely spent any time together by the time of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.  The book also reveals how Meghan regarded some commentary and tabloid stories as \u0027sexist\u0027 and \u0027prejudiced\u0027, with ambitious women of colour like her labelled \u0027demanding and aggressive\u0027.  A close friend of Meghan\u0027s told the authors: \u0027Duchess Different. That\u0027s what people have a problem with. She\u0027s the easiest person in the world to work with. Certain people just don\u0027t like the fact she stands out.\u0027 The biography is written by journalists Scobie and Durand, who are fans of the couple and have set out to \u0027correct the record\u0027 and shift the spotlight on to their charitable ventures.The Sussexes say they did not contribute to the book, but Scobie and Durand\u0027s account is based on extensive insight from friends of the couple.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbe5312fbd0c8848710d0757d18f14ae043342a2/0_72_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=624113f5dd8e0f1b872d5f5ad21773a7","title":"boohoo to set up model garment factory in leicester","story":"Plans announced after claims in July that some workers were being paid £3.50 an hourBoohoo, the fashion retailer facing allegations that workers in its supply chain were treated as modern day slaves, has announced plans to set up its own “model factory” to ensure workers are treated fairly.The company, which was co-founded by billionaire Mahmud Kamani, said it would employ 250 people at a new Leicester factory it hopes will start producing clothes for its PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal brands by September.John Lyttle, Boohoo’s chief executive, announced plans for the factory as the company battles to rebuild its reputation after claims in early July that workers at a Leicester garment factory that supplied Boohoo were paid as little as £3.50 an hour. That is far below the minimum wage of £8.72 for those aged 25.Staff were also allegedly not wearing protective masks to help stall the spread of Covid-19, and an outbreak in Leicester was linked to the city’s garment district factories.Lyttle said supply chain working practices exposed by the  and other media had been “upsetting”. “If there’s stuff wrong in Leicester I’d rather find and fix it, not run for the hills,” he said.Priti Patel, the home secretary, described the alleged working practices as “truly appalling”, and called on the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate. “Let this be a warning to those who are exploiting people in sweatshops like these for their own commercial gain,” she said. “This is just the start. What you are doing is illegal, it will not be tolerated and we are coming after you.”Boohoo launched an independent review of its UK supply chain, led by Alison Levitt QC, and axed two suppliers, Morefray and Revolution Clothing. The firm will give an update on the review, including its terms of reference, this week.The company has also hired an independent factory auditor, Verisio, which started conducting unannounced spot checks at the fashion firm’s UK suppliers and their subcontractors in May. Since the scandal, the auditor has been visiting the factories to ensure workers are given details of a confidential whistleblower hotline operated by Verisio.Lyttle said the new factory “will have the latest capital equipment and promote the highest standards of health and safety throughout the facility”. He expects it will produce 50,000 garments a week.The scandal sent Boohoo’s share price plunging, and some £1.7bn was wiped off its stock market value, but it has recovered slightly in recent weeks. Major retailers including Next, Asos and Amazon removed all Boohoo clothing from sale.Setting up its own factory will allow Boohoo to demonstrate best practice, Lyttle said. The company has bought a 1 hectare (2.5 acre) former car showroom to turn into the new factory.If the factory is not up and running by September, Boohoo will lease a temporary site in Leicester in the meantime. Lyttle said that the firm was looking at opening another factory elsewhere in the UK.Along with other online retailers, Boohoo, which started as a market stall in Manchester, has seen sales surge during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is expanding, with plans to open another warehouse in the UK in addition to the one in Burnley, where 2,500 people work.Producing some of its clothes itself is also part of Boohoo’s strategy to get its fast fashion quickly to consumers. Spain’s Inditex, the owner of the Zara chain, makes its own clothes so it can get them into shops quickly.Lyttle said while a lot of retailers were ordering stock six to nine months in advance, Boohoo was planning only two weeks ahead. Buying a large chunk of its garments in the UK meant that Boohoo can get its clothes from the factory to customers within days, rather than weeks if they were imported. Having its own factory should speed things up further."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ac0b8c4b91a8ad44bbd2b439c7686f8936a6c9/0_384_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f365717415f1325c34fabe421c5cbf7","title":"debenhams up for sale in last ditch bid to avoid liquidation","story":"Debenhams has put itself up for sale in a last-ditch attempt to prevent a fall into liquidation.The 242-year-old department store chain this weekend appointed investment bank Lazard to oversee the sale process and hopes to secure a buyer before the end of September.The struggling retail group called in administrators in April, for the second time in a year. The restructuring firm FRP Advisory is working alongside its management under a “light touch” administration.This means directors are running the business rather than handing it over to the administrators. The chain has already shut 18 stores, with the loss of more than 1,000 jobs in shops and at the headquarters in London. After lease negotiations with landlords, 124 stores are still trading. They reopened on 15 June after the government allowed non-essential retailers to open again following the Covid-19 lockdown.“Now that Debenhams has 124 stores in the UK open and is trading ahead of expectations, the administrators of Debenhams Retail Ltd have initiated a process to assess ways for the business to exit its protective administration,” the company said on Sunday.“There are a range of possible outcomes which could include the current owners retaining the business, potential new joint venture arrangements (with existing and potential new investors) or a sale to a third party, and the administrators will be guided by what delivers the best outcome for creditors.”Like other retailers, Debenhams has been badly hit by the coronavirus lockdown, but was already struggling with a £600m debt pile. It previously went into administration in April 2019, which wiped out its shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors including US hedge funds managed by Silver Point Capital and GoldenTree Asset Management. Debenhams then underwent a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency procedure that allowed it to close stores and renegotiate rents.Debenhams’ Irish chain has been placed into liquidation, but a liquidation of the main group is unlikely and would only happen once all other options have been exhausted. Debenhams also owns the Magasin du Nord chain in Denmark.Rival John Lewis plans to close eight of its 50 stores putting 1,300 jobs at risk, while Marks \u0026amp Spencer is cutting 950 jobs as part of a £500m cost-saving drive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3a7f0a79281d44e37f23f6d7e60b090470ee3b/0_9_5373_3224/master/5373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e835ded5c38652ba811e147b96e2617","title":"natwest customers say accounts closed applied for coronavirus bounce back loans","story":"Small business say funds were blocked after applying for government-backed schemeNatWest has shut the accounts of some small business customers who applied for government-backed loans to help them get through the pandemic, leaving them distressed and unable to access their cash.The bank said the reasons for closing the accounts were valid, but the closures came after customers had been approved for loans and were expecting to receive the money in their accounts.Instead, customers said their money had been blocked without notice, with one saying he was now unable to afford food as a result.The Treasury is about to enter talks with the UK’s largest banks on a plan to help tackle the tens of billions of pounds of bad debts expected to result from the bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS), which requires only minimal checks on the borrower’s ability to pay the money back.The NatWest group has been responsible for more than a fifth of the lending across the three government-backed loan schemes. However, there have been claims that the bank initially struggled under the weight of loan applications, and that the fraud checks that needed to be carried out were causing issues.NatWest is bracing itself for a wave of bad debts, but on Sunday denied reports that it plans to make cost savings of £3bn over the next five years.The bank, which changed its name from RBS last week, said a report in the Sunday Times that it was planning to reduce its annual costs from £7bn to £4bn was inaccurate. “We do not have any plans of this type,” a spokeswoman said.It is not clear how many accounts have been closed following bounce-back loan applications, or why NatWest has frozen the accounts of existing customers after approving them for a loan.Twitter users have claimed in recent days that NatWest has shut their accounts after approving bounce-back loans. Meanwhile, a Facebook group called “NatWest closed down my account” that was set up in January now has more than 1,300 members, with many posting similar claims.On the three cases the  passed to the bank, the NatWest spokesperson added: “Investigations confirm that the reason for closing these specific customers’ accounts is valid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd08e2883879df798edfa89b856a3dc07bc5b109/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16424d91f1ca93a2ba15c45c1806a156","title":"the guardian view on china and the uighurs everyones business","story":"At last the world is beginning to react to the mounting evidence of horrific human rights abuses in Xinjiang It has taken too many horrors, but at last the world is paying heed to China’s treatment of the Uighurs. Satellite pictures of detention camps, and procurement requests for spiked clubs, have been supplemented by leaked internal documents warning “allow no escapes”, and growing testimony from relatives and former inmates whose desperation has overcome their fear of retaliation for speaking out.What once, perhaps, seemed remote and opaque to those in other countries has become much more immediate. The crackdown in Hong Kong, taking place in the public eye, has highlighted the ruthlessness of the Communist party’s response to perceived challenges. Reports of the forced use of IUDs, sterilisation and abortion suggests a campaign to slash birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities, which some experts have described as “demographic genocide”. Last week a coalition of rights groups warned that virtually the entire fashion industry is complicit in abuses, due to the use of forced labour in Xinjiang’s mammoth cotton industry. It is harder to turn your back on people who made the shirt upon it.An estimated million or more Uighurs, and other Turkic Muslims, have been held in the camps for the most moderate expressions of religious belief, having relatives abroad, or even failing to pay bills. Former inmates describe political indoctrination and abuses ranging from being forced to eat pork to rape and torture. Though some have been released, others have been sentenced to long prison terms or transferred to factories as forced labour. Those outside dwell in a digital gulag, under relentless hi-tech and human surveillance. China, which initially denied the camps’ existence, now says they are vocational centres to re-educate those “infected” by extremism and terrorism – a necessary deradicalisation campaign following violent attacks. Yet its approach in the region amounts to treating Uighurs and their way of life as fundamentally suspect. Almost any expression of Uighur culture, bar singing and dancing, is regarded as threatening – and thus in need of eradication.The US has already blacklisted companies and institutions it believes are involved in human rights violations in the region. But though Donald Trump has now signed a law calling for sanctions against officials responsible for violation, he reportedly told Xi Jinping that the detention camps were “exactly the right thing to do”. Meanwhile, hawkish Republicans voice a hitherto undetected interest in Muslim religious rights. The administration’s cynicism is not an excuse for others to dodge the issue. On the contrary: it is all the more reason to demonstrate the depth and breadth of opposition to outrageous violations of human rights.Britain and France have stepped up their criticism. The UK now has an opportunity to use the new Magnitsky-style law to target officials responsible for crimes in Xinjiang. But China has too long been able to play countries off against each other. The European Union must do more. António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, should publicly press China to allow his rights chief access to the region. Muslim countries remain shockingly silent.Pressure should also be exerted on companies doing business in the region. The coalition that issued last week’s warning on the fashion industry is urging governments to strengthen laws banning trade in goods produced using forced labour, and to require human rights due diligence in supply chains. But consumers can play their part too. British lawyers have argued that the international community is legally obliged to take action over what is happening in Xinjiang. The moral case needs no debate. Uighurs can wait no longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f361e76a5d1fe02c1fdf3e1fa8607c8339ac85c2/0_70_3726_2235/master/3726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06be0cc7749718242154a5f64ac35ae4","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

Thyme – green, silver and variegated mint (the herb garden bully) coriander that forever threatens to bolt into a fluff of fairy parasols. There is a Vietnamese basil bush whose spikes of purple flowers are too beautiful to drown in a bowl of pho, and wide leaves of Italian basil that fall into a faint if you so much as raise your voice. The latter must be used immediately.Preserved in oil, the more fragile leaves lose much of their magic. Frozen, they emerge stripped of their aromatic powers. So the green bounty of scented leaves I am growing in pots is something to use with abandon. Basil has been torn over plates of peaches and burrata all summer long. Thyme is stirred into bean soups and coriander is hidden in a tangle of grated courgette fritters. Basil is a favourite for pounding to a verdant paste with mauve-skinned summer garlic, while tarragon is regularly mashed into a mayonnaise to become a shimmering chartreuse paste. No one can say this kitchen isn’t fragrant.This week, I mashed a fistful of parsley, thyme and dill into a slab of softened butter and used it to season a roast chicken, teasing the freckled fat under the skin with two fingers. It’s a delicate job, even with the thick skin of an outdoor reared bird. But if you can get the paste to sit, sandwiched between skin and flesh, it will calmly baste the roasting meat from the inside. Sliced, the chicken will have a nut brown skin and a stripe of still vivid green herb paste framing the white breast meat. The juices in the tin smell of high summer and provide somewhere to toss spinach leaves, radishes, cooked flageolet beans or tiny turnips.Take care not to tear the skin as you push the butter between it and the flesh of the bird. It isn’t the end of the world if it tears, it will simply escape into the roasting tin.

Peel the garlic and then grate or crush it, then add to the herbs. Cut the butter into small pieces and mix with the herbs, creaming them together with a wooden spoon. Season lightly with salt.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the chicken in a roasting tin. Carefully work two or three fingers between the skin and flesh of the breast to create a large pocket under the skin. (They should part quite naturally.) Push the herb butter between the flesh and skin, spreading it evenly by massaging the skin. Put any remaining butter in the chest cavity.Trim and wipe the turnips, then cut them in half. Trickle the olive oil over the chicken skin, then add the turnips to the pan and roast for 25 minutes. Add the radishes to the pan, turn them in the roasting juices, and return to the oven for a further 25 minutes.To cook the beans, first drain and place them in deep, boiling water for approximately 25-35 minutes until tender. Add salt for the final 10 minutes. (It is always worth checking the beans’ progress regularly. Some batches will take longer than others, depending on their age.) Drain the beans and set aside.To serve the chicken, remove the roasting tin from the oven and place the chicken on a warm serving plate. Stir the drained beans into the radishes, turnips and roasting juices, and return to the switched off oven to keep warm.Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes then carve and serve with the beans and vegetables.You could measure my summer in chicken salads, but each one is very different from the other.

The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day. Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck’s backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously. Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier. It is hard to escape the sense that Watford’s habit of flipping managers has run out of road. Their next permanent – perhaps in the loosest sense of – appointment will be the 12th in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in.Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as “a bit of a basketball game”, although it certainly made for fine entertainment. Arteta said afterwards Watford’s forwards had been “cheating”, although he quickly clarified that as a football term for “gambling, staying up front”. They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately. Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily. Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney. But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal’s advantage.Aubameyang then controlled Tierney’s long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end. Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout. He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too. Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday’s FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr. But Watford’s prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93f11339d6a29da97d57843f9c4e723ab7d01d5/100_103_2948_1769/master/2948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa272de5c657029902f60dc50e08fce","title":"solskjaer manchester united leicester champions league","story":"The win at Leicester offered few thrills but the no-frills way it clinched Champions League football will do United no harmThey’re back, baby, they’re back. Back with a whimper perhaps, at the end of an edgy, sluggish, winning performance at the King Power Stadium. But Manchester United are back in the Champions League all the same, a top-four place secured with a slow-burn 2-0 defeat of Leicester City.This being planet Earth in the year 2020, it came in the strangest of circumstances. Seven minutes into injury time on a muggy late-July day Jesse Lingard could be seen rolling the ball into an empty net in front of a row of inspirational tarpaulins.Moments later the final whistle euthanised this distended league season out of existence. It was greeted by shouts and shrieks from the scattered United staff, and by the sight of the accidental saviour Ole Gunnar Solskjær bowling out on to the pitch looking wide-eyed and very slightly overcome in his skinny black suit and white shirt.Eleven months, one global shutdown and an economic collapse in the making, the news is at least reassuringly samey from the Premier League. The four wealthiest clubs in England will now take up those four spots and compete in the world’s glitziest midweek league. The teams who are usually the teams are once again the teams. Dissent, unrest and social revolution may come and go, but the Premier League remains, for now, largely unmoved.There was still an element of genuine jeopardy here, not least for Solskjær himself. Rarely has the line between over-promoted company man and curator of the thrilling new red dawn seemed so fine. But such are the margins at times. Football may be theatre. But nobody ever said it was subtle theatre.To his credit Solskjær played all his strongest cards from the start. Rightly so, as there has been tangible progress on the pitch in the last few months. Pogba-Fernandes-Matic is the most engaging midfield United have had since the Ferguson endgame. Rashford-Martial has become a potent partnership. Mason Greenwood is that rare thing, a genuine, believe-the-hype prodigy of the kind that speaks in direct, seductive tones to United’s own self-mythologising.Still, there was an awkwardness to the occasion as Leicester sat deep in the opening moments and allowed United’s passing to stall in front of them. The gameplan seemed clear enough: wait for the mistake, counterattack at speed. Harry Maguire has many qualities as a defender but he also turns like a waterlogged fishing dinghy and runs toward his own goal with all the easy grace of a heavily laden suburban milk float.For a while the game was scrappy. Occasionally United’s bravura front three clicked into motion, then seemed to lose their timing, like men communicating via a low-bandwidth internet conference call. In the past three months Marcus Rashford has played 10 games and organised a policy-changing child welfare campaign. He is probably allowed to feel a little tired.Paul Pogba was prominent but never quite in the command seat. Bruno Fernandes was poor, as he has been occasionally a midfielder hoist as a panacea to successive seasons of incoherent squad-building, and now already facing a world record new-signing backlash. Football has always been a skittish, impatient business, but Fernandes has barely finished holding up the shirt and grinning beneath a scarf.By half-time there was still a sense of the day waiting to take shape. Finally, with 67 minutes gone, a kind of deliverance arrived. The impressive Hamza Choudhury gave the ball away. Greenwood played a cute, instant forward pass, a rare act of precision in a sea of vagueness. Anthony Martial was brought down by a double judo-trip move from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans.Up stepped the leg-weary Fernandes. On the bench Solskjær looked like a man trying very hard not to vomit over the deck-rail. The kick was tucked gently into the corner. And that was pretty much that, as Leicester’s endless season, not to mention their six missing first-team players, finally caught up with them.What does it all mean? There is of course a degree of confected tension about all this. But even for a club of such enduring heft a return to the Champions League will affect every aspect of Manchester United.For Solskjær this is now a mini-era in its own right: if not a new dawn, then at least a first chink of light beneath the curtain. And it is worth being kind here. Despite the anxieties of the last three games there has been a genuine vim and snap about United’s attacking play of late.Not to mention a rare sense of clarity. If there is little remarkable in Solskjær’s management, this is a virtue in itself. United’s manager has one outstanding quality: his lack of any obvious outstanding qualities, a simplicity that is in itself a very useful asset.Let’s face it, this vast sporting machine doesn’t actually need any additional fuel, any complex characters or interfering egos. At times something this large and complex just needs to be steered in the right direction, to be demystified and untangled rather than overthought.Solskjær has imposed a simple system and made some demands about fitness. United’s zany playing squad has been clarified. The best players tend to end up on the pitch. Half of the outfield 10 were Solskjær players to some degree. Two thirds of a decent team is in place here. Better still, this feels like something else. For all the wariness of the King Power in late July, there is hope here – not to mention, for the first time in some time, a sense of lightness too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6814c29e5aaa70663255b3b1f110b2e158b51ef7/58_39_3214_1930/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69d479bcfd1d8411682af7557b5e4955","title":"swansea brentford championship play off match report","story":"Thomas Frank, the Brentford head coach, has said the English Football League should utilise video assistant referee technology in matches of such magnitude after his side were reduced to 10 men before slipping to defeat in the first leg of the Championship play-off semi-final at Swansea. Rico Henry was given a straight red card despite appearing to win the ball after sliding in on Connor Roberts before André Ayew started and finished a wonderful move to strike an exquisite winner and make amends for a penalty miss.Frank said Brentford would appeal Henry’s dismissal and is adamant the Football Association will rescind the red card, allowing the left-back to be available for the second leg on Wednesday at Griffin Park, which is set to host its final competitive game before demolition. Frank spoke to the referee, Keith Stroud, after the game but said he “didn’t buy” the officials’ explanation for the decision.David Raya made a fine save to deny Ayew from the spot but Steve Cooper felt his side should have had another penalty when Rhian Brewster was booked for ing despite appearing to collide with the Brentford goalkeeper. However Cooper insisted the red card was the correct decision. “You can’t do that nowadays, you can’t be as excessive as that, as dangerous as that, whether there is a touch on the ball or not, and expect to stay on the pitch,” Cooper said. “Times have changed.”Ayew’s winner was fitting for an entertaining game between two of the ision’s most fluid sides. He danced inside from the right flank before locating Conor Gallagher, whose deft flick looped over Christian Nørgaard and into Jay Fulton, who laid the ball off for Ayew to smack into the top corner for his 18th goal of the elongated campaign. As Cooper pointed out, it is an impressive tally given Ayew, in his second spell at the club, has operated on the left flank for the majority of the season. “He has lived up to his ability and his level of play. Let’s hope he can take it into Wednesday as well.”Brentford began in lively mood and unsettled Swansea, showing no signs of being jaded after missing out on automatic promotion in midweek. Ollie Watkins carved out a series of openings, with Erwin Mulder, the Swansea goalkeeper, saving smartly down to his right to push away a cute backward header by the Brentford striker. Saïd Benrahma also went close, shooting over after bamboozling three Swansea shirts on a mazy run.The Liverpool loanee Brewster, one of a trio of Swansea loanees who lifted the Under-17 World Cup under former England youth coach Cooper three years ago, should have found a first-half breakthrough but he headed tamely at Raya after Ayew rattled a post. Mathias Jensen also spurned a golden opportunity for the visitors after being slipped in by Benrahma but it was Ayew who showed a touch of class to give Swansea a priceless leg-up.“It’s only an advantage if we use it,” said Cooper. “We will recover and prepare and, as far as I’m concerned it will be 0-0 and we will go there to play normally. André brushed off the disappointment of the penalty and didn’t let that affect him, but that’s what he does, step up in the big moments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

But as soon as you lift your face and taste the fresh tang of salt on the air, you will mark how this sky is as different, fickle and changeable as all you have left behind. Then, if you listen, you will hear the laughing gulls. And beyond that, heading off in a low V-shape, the haunting call of the geese.I have lived in the Hebrides for more than 16 years – the first years with my husband, and for the past decade with my dog, Maude, alone. I had been dreaming of staring out at a raw, open horizon for years – ever since I found an old map of Scotland and pinned it up in the hallway in my London flat. It was positioned across the full length of a narrow wall where I always saw it as I was passing, at an angle where your eyes fell into that empty space between giant masses of land. It is always during that notion of transit, of passing from one space to another, that your heart opens and all of your dreaming begins. I would press my nose to that thick paper, inhaling its musty scent, as my finger traced the ragged coastline of the fractured islets and islands. In those moments, as my eyes closed, the traffic, shouts from the street, neighbours slamming doors, would evaporate into the hurl of fresh spindrift, the thick, curling crests of the breakers drenching the salt-stung air, the gulls tearing the skies apart with an aching, screaming call.I had loved my early years in London. I lived in Notting Hill, in a flat with an iron gate leading out on to communal garden. It was a sanctuary in the heart of the city, with a buzzing, cosmopolitan local community on tap. I was there years before the film came out, when you bought your vegetables in a brown paper bag with cash, knew all the street vendors, got your cigarettes from the cashier at the toy shop on the corner of Kensington Park Road. It was a time of hope and dreaming of your beautiful life, and Britpop singing the world real again.But in London, neighbourhoods are transient and can shift as quickly as the low skies gusting overhead. Suddenly, there was a disconcerting invisibility to the formerly gregarious community and a disheartening, unsettling and desolate feeling that permeated the streets. People started walking more quickly, heads bowed, barely meeting your eyes. Humanity is a vulnerable, vigilant thing. Our building was spray-painted with graffiti, windows were broken, the police were called. One day, arriving home, I screamed as I walked into the back garden. The plants were torn apart, some that were flowering had been uprooted. I fought tears as I looked into the pond. Cans of paint had been poured over the wall, the containers left floating in the water. Hidden in the reeds were the faded, bloated corpses of our beautiful, bright little fish. Something died in me that day.A neighbour was mugged, then another knocked to the ground. I stopped walking around the neighbourhood. Those weeks were a tense, nail-biting time when everything became dark and feral. Worn down by months of this, I started waking in the night, feeling breathless, my heart thudding. Stress is invisible subtle and insidious, it builds up over time. Anxiety is like a smouldering fire. All it takes is a scream, a moment of fear, to whip those flickering embers into burning flames.It was the fall of silence that struck me. It had a porous feel to it, as if the sky had been spilled into it until there was room for little else. No raised voices, no bricks through the window. No rattling of sticks on a metal grille, or buses thundering past. Inside, there was a stillness like cool, clear water. And I knew that it was this quiet that I had been seeking for so long. It did not matter that the cottage we had moved our lives into had no water, electricity, outside drains or paint on its walls. It did not matter that there was no heating or insulation. Nor that it was as freezing cold inside as it was outside, with just a single stone grate in one end wall. It did not matter that it was unloved and had not been lived in for five years.I will never forget the day I travelled to start my life on the island. Arriving alone, as a stranger, was one of those unnerving twists of fate that only holds a deeper resonance in later years. I like to think it was my first test of facing my fears and putting my trust in the unknown. Looking back, I had no idea that those early years would only be the start of a fiercer, wilder, intensely difficult period that would tax my courage, resilience and endurance to breaking point and beyond. Growth is not always easy, and sometimes a new seed has to be encouraged, even forced, to grow.The island is barely 12 miles long, its narrow girth tightening to half a mile, with close to 140 residents, another 10 or so renting temporarily. I had not planned to be here alone. We arrived as a couple and at first we were happy. When my husband left, the challenges began. I was grief-stricken and struggling to cope. My father had only recently died and my mother had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I was still shattered by devastating loss after years of infertility, up to my neck in crippling debt and unable to work, struggling to function. My confidence was drained I had broken both of my hands in two separate accidents, and simple tasks became overwhelmingly difficult. I felt helpless. Then my best friend – a woman I had met on the island – was killed in a car crash.Grief is like soil. It is heavy and clings to your skin when you come up for air. Sometimes even after you have brushed it off it is suddenly there again, miring you in something dead and weighted and dark.For a few years, solitude became all my life. When I lived in London, solitude was synonymous with relaxation. It meant a pause or vital decompression, a moment of balancing, a slow drawing of breath – an experience to be savoured. It was never so internal as to be a state or frame of mind. I looked forward to it – time set aside to allow something restricted inside to free itself. On the island, my experience of isolation was frightening because it so quickly normalised – a clear, cold wind of solitude that I used to love now wrapped around me, a constant presence. I began to notice I was often shivering, how the days felt cold. Isolation is a process of self-harming. You do not wish to go there, but over time it feels a safe place to be. It is addictive.I have always been sociable and, in London, was used to being surrounded by company. I knew something was wrong when I felt unable to connect with others on the island. I kept trying to reach out, but it was as if some inner inhibition was blocking me, so each encounter hurt, like a bruising collision. Authentic connection is made more difficult when you are living alone, at a distance from close friends and family. I found myself searching others’ eyes like a moth seeking a light – but my eyes were always too wanting or hopeful. Over time, those collisions felt increasingly sharp, abrasive.When I was most isolated, I was also coping with an acute yet chronic respiratory illness and my immune system collapsed. Each intake of breath felt like inhaling tiny shards of glass. One winter night, I forced myself out of the house. I stood alone, wrapped in blankets, shivering in the darkness. It was such a comfort to look up and feel that great breathing night sky around me, eyes wide, gazing into a dark glittering universe of stars. It helped me to take a breath, force myself to stretch out, to release that suffocating inhibition. That night, I lifted my arms and asked for help. I was aware of feeling some mysterious reciprocity of kindness. Something inexpressible in the immense darkness answered me.Now I embrace solitude. For the past four years, at dawn, I have run across the hills to the sea. It was the sea that helped me break that cold silence inside. Each day I throw lost hours into the water. It renews my strength, fires resilience inside and gives me a sense of gratitude for my warm breath and beating heart. I never used to like cold water, yet here I have grown to love its shocking, icy embrace. Every day, whatever the weather, I rise early and head for the shore. I have not missed a day, regardless of storms and punishing Hebridean conditions. I have swum in snow, in freezing rain with thick ice particles obscuring visibility, in crisp sunshine and in dense mist, and once with the wind chill dipping to -16C and the solid, crackling edges of the sea freezing.Standing on the shoreline as the waves come barrelling towards you helps you to step into all you normally draw back from. Cold water swimming takes you beyond resistance. It invites you to ask, “What else do you fear?” It forces you to tackle all in your life that has a stronger undertow. In the water there is no place for fear. I used to tell myself, “Soon I will stop.” Eventually, I realised I didn’t want to. It gets me up to set firm boundaries. It teaches stamina, courage, inner resilience and buoyancy. Sometimes you think you have nothing left to give, and then it asks for more, so you give more of yourself than you ever imagined was possible. If I can stand bare-skinned in the freezing cold, hurl myself into the waves and keep swimming, then I am winning.Solitude helps you to redraw your own parameters, but its navigation takes skill and practice. Immersed in nature, you learn to look to the tides, winds, weather, currents, and raw elements more closely. That knowledge becomes instinctive. When I am alone, I am more focused and attuned to the particular nuances and subtleties in the natural world around me. Life is simplified. You feel your own humanity, physicality and interconnectedness acutely.These days, life runs calmly. I have dear friends and close community, yet I still value and actively make space for my own solitude. I still do not have family, kin, children, so I have learned to fill that space with different, other lives. Now I understand how isolation and often the most shattering experiences in life are so important. The profound depth of our suffering holds all kinds of hidden truths. Nature is regenerative. Everything has to break down in order to renew.Each morning, as I wake to the dawn sky and the sun rising over the mountains, the sound of the wind and weather is a familiar, loved presence. I always sleep with my window open. If I listen, I hear the buzzards and a great silence of mountains beyond. It is quiet when I go downstairs. There is always a quality of stillness that is only felt in an old house. In winter the power still goes off and so the early mornings start with candlelight. I rarely eat alone. Wild birds often fly in the open windows. They sit perched on a gnarled hazel twig that swings tied to a branch I use as a curtain rail. We sit and watch each other as I talk to Maude, pressed close against my legs.When you immerse yourself deeply into nature, exposing yourself to discomfort and risk, you recalibrate more sensitively to unseen patterns and rhythms. You feel your own pulse and breath instilled with a peace and calmness. The rugged landscape becomes hewn differently, takes on more intimate contours. Immersed daily in the sea, swimming in all weathers, it is interesting how other aspects of your life start adjusting to this routine. Tasks are organised differently, more closely aligned to the bigger cycles of sun, moon and tides and seasonal shifts. Some call this biodynamic living, and it makes sense. It connects the unique solitude of every animate or inanimate sentience, and connects it to an expansive, interconnected universe.That realisation came to me one early dawn. It was freezing, the depths of winter. I stripped off and ed into the waves. Out in the channel, the wind had dropped and snow, long promised, started to fall. Then something happened that changed my life. A wilder voice called my name with love and changed me forever. Afterwards, all it takes is a breath to reconnect to the pulse and beat of the universe. Once that feeling is experienced, it is impossible ever to feel alone.

He intended to stay for a couple of weeks, but he is still there, sitting in front of his computer screen. It is first thing in the morning for me, but it is the evening for Stein, and he is planning to go to the pub. He was hoping to make it back to the UK early next month, but his flight was cancelled. So, from his house in Sydney, he is watching as the pandemic wreaks havoc across the UK’s restaurants, including his own.It must be stressful, I say. Stein smiles and rubs his hand over his head. “It can be a bit frustrating because I don’t get told everything that’s happening back at base,” he says. “I have to keep jumping up and down, saying: ‘Hey, I’m still here!’” He laughs a lot, and I can’t tell if this is just his affable style, familiar from his TV cookery programmes, or a nervous defence mechanism.With his first wife, Jill, Stein opened the Seafood Restaurant in Padstow, a small fishing port in North Cornwall. This was in 1975, so he has been through recessions and a financial crisis before. How does this compare? “Much worse,” he says with a grim smile. “In 2008, we had to cut back and lay off staff, but nothing like this. We didn’t have to close any restaurants we didn’t have as many restaurants then, of course. But this has been …” He trails off. “If we hadn’t done what we’ve done, we would have gone to the wall, no question about it. Unfortunately, a lot of restaurants will.”Stein decided not to reopen two of his six British restaurants when they were allowed to start trading again at the beginning of July. That was, he says, “very unpleasant. It’s been really tricky explaining to the staff that it has to go” – and their jobs with it. He hopes that the chef Michael Caines, who bought Stein’s restaurant in Porthleven in west Cornwall earlier this month, will keep on the staff. Meanwhile, Stein had to present “quite a complicated case” to the bank to get a loan to carry the business over for the other four restaurants (there is also a cafe, two fish and chip shops, a pub, a cookery school and holiday cottages, mostly based in Cornwall). “We still don’t know whether we’ll make it or not because, cash-wise, the worst time for us will be next January and February,” he says. “Thank goodness the government has seen fit to let us open for the two busiest months in the summer.”At the end of March, the company was criticised for reportedly telling staff they would not be paid until the government’s job retention scheme kicked in, which would have left them without salaries for more than a month. The company’s managing director, Ian Fitzgerald, later clarified that its 600-plus furloughed staff would be paid, but it was a question of timing – to honour the payroll on time could have meant running out of cash and, he said: “The company may have to close permanently.” He has now said in a statement to the : “We paid for all hours worked up until the enforced closure. The government furlough scheme then applied and was paid on the same day we received the grants.” In April, staff received their pay in two instalments.Stein admits it has “been tricky. I think when you’re in a situation like that, you can’t turn around and blame yourself for being too mean or something. It’s just either you do that or you go out of business.”Stein is 73, though he seems strangely ageless and has no intention of retiring. “It’s a bloody nightmare being 73 really because I don’t feel any older than I was 40 years ago.” Perhaps, he concedes, he feels “a bit creaky”. He is an accidental restaurateur. Originally, he had planned to run a nightclub. He opened a club in Padstow, before losing his licence once it became known as a trouble spot, and reopened it as the restaurant it now is.It has been a choppy ride, however. Stein became one of the original celebrity chefs, making his first TV series in the mid-90s. When, in 2002, he left Jill for his second wife, Sarah, an Australian publicist 20 years his junior, after a five-year affair, there was much public interest. Then, as the Stein empire grew, so did rumours, fuelled by tabloid interviews with angry local people, about a bitterness between the locals and the interloper. But the suggestions that he moved in and took over, or that he did not buy the fish for his restaurants locally proved to be incorrect, and Stein himself is no outsider in the area. He has been in Cornwall for nearly 50 years, and spent childhood summers there. His connection to the area goes back even further, to his grandparents who bought a house there just after the first world war.In Stein’s 2013 memoir, he wrote vividly about growing up on a farm in the Cotswolds, and his exposure to food. His dad, the managing director of a distilling company, liked to point out, at Sunday lunch, that everything from the meat to the vegetables had come from their land. “If you are used to eating well as a child, you will end up probably being quite serious about what you eat as an adult, so I feel very blessed with that.”The flipside to Stein’s otherwise idyllic and privileged childhood was his father’s bipolar disorder. In his book, he writes that his mother protected him and his four siblings from the worst of his father’s depressive periods, but he also wrote that his father was “someone I was scared of”. When Stein was 17, his father killed himself. He spent the next few years travelling and grafting his way around Australia and America – working on ships and railroads and in an abbatoir. He was trying to be a “manly Ernest Hemingway character”, he writes, when really he was “on the run from the memory of my father” and his death. Back in the UK, despite his two Es at A-level, with the help of a private tutor, he wangled a place as a mature student at Oxford to read English.He has said before that his father’s death made him more driven. “I think so,” he says now. “I’ve definitely got a sense of not being very good at stuff. It’s sort of absurd because, you know, I’ve done really quite well for myself, but I still really doubt myself. It’s just the way I am.” Has he had therapy? “Oh God, yeah, a lot of therapy. I understand it now. It’s fine, I understand it.” His wife comes into the room to remind him that they need to go and he tells her he’ll be a minute, then returns to the thought. “But it’s silly. It’s difficult to tell, isn’t it, whether you are naturally a person that likes hard work and does things, or whether you feel you’ve got to prove something?”Asked for his biggest achievement, he takes a long pause. “I think the restaurants really.” It seems impressive, I say, that the business managed to survive the Steins’ orce and that Jill is still very much part of it. “I think it was just too good a business to … People feel very strongly about restaurants if they’re involved in them. It tends to take over your life for good and bad.” Was it difficult to keep everyone together, including Jill? “It’s not always been great, I have to say.” He smiles, but is clearly not prepared to go into it further (I’m also aware of someone, his wife I think, wandering around in the background).There is also a hint that, horrible though this time is, Stein seems to thrive on the challenge. You don’t, after all, go into the restaurant business for an easy life, and you don’t try to push fish and seafood in a country that is traditionally suspicious of anything that doesn’t come in batter or breadcrumbs. “I ring up Ian and a few of the other managers and there is this sense that we’re going through something together,” he says. “There’s a tremendous feeling of bonding with people. That’s what’s good about the industry anyway, because it is tough at times, you do tend to rely on each other.” He says he knows “it must be very depressing” for his employees who will lose their jobs, but says that, among his staff: “It’s a real sense of us all working together to keep the business running. It’s better to fight and all go down together sort of thing.” And he has been pleased at the way his three sons, who are all involved in the business in some way, have “sort of taken over. It’s made them a lot more responsible. That’s made me very proud of them.”But no-shows aside – and he is quick to say he understands if people suddenly feel uneasy about going to a restaurant – the experience of reopening has been good, he says. “People want to go out and eat, there’s no question about that. It’s not something that’s just going to go because of Covid. It’s heartening the way people have come back to restaurants.”Stein has coped with the stress of the pandemic by swimming every day. During Sydney’s lockdown, he did a lot of gardening and DIY, and read. Like many people, he learned to make sourdough bread. He kept in touch with his UK empire every day and although he has a business partner in Australia who oversees the running of his restaurants there, he says: “There’s plenty going on. And I’m doing some TV as well.” The cooking-and-travel shows will be put on hold once he is back in the UK (he splits his time between here and Australia) and he is going to do a programme about Cornwall. “I doubt there will be a lot of travel for the next six months. But that’s great, I’m quite missing Cornwall.”Can his Cornish businesses survive with all the changes that have to be made, including fewer tables? “I don’t know,” he admits. “I think at the moment we’re doing quite well. It’s just a question of whether we can take enough to compensate for the months we were shut, and what happens in October and November.”He will fight on, in his own hardworking and slightly diffident way, in a business in which he has spent nearly half a century. He is, he says, “very optimistic about the future. I think human beings thrive on communication, and pubs and restaurants are a great way of communicating, a great way of enjoying each other.” Restaurants are still, he says, “really important”.

Here we answer the important questions employers and employees faceWorking from home looks set to be a part of many people’s lives for some time to come. At the beginning of lockdown in March, employees would have been forgiven for thinking that their office moving to their spare room or kitchen table would be a temporary affair. The reality is that many will remain there until next year.RBS announced that almost 50,000 workers will not go back into the office until 2021, even as the government urged employers to encourage their staff to return. While many people may have been able to deal with a few months at home, the prospect of many more to come throws up a series of questions for them and their bosses.HMRC says that some of the cost of working from home may be eligible for tax relief, such as business phone calls or the gas and electricity for your work area. However, expenses that are used for both private and business use cannot be claimed for. Fill out a P87 form if they are less than £2,500 for the year. You will need records and receipts when filling it out.If more, you will need to complete a self-assessment tax return. However, it can be difficult to apportion costs so you can, instead, claim tax relief on £6 a week. Or your employer is allowed to pay you £6 a week tax-free.At the start of lockdown computer retailers reported a glut of orders as companies stocked up on laptops needed by staff to work from home. However, not all employers will agree to cover the cost, and many workers can find they have to foot the bill themselves for setting up a home office, or they have to use their own equipment. Conciliation service Acas says both sides should agree beforehand on how they should work and what equipment will be used.Employers should carry out risk assessments - if not, they could be found at fault in a future claim for something like repetitive strain injury. The chance of problems arising grow with the amount of time workers are at home, says Caroline Doran Millett, an employment lawyer at Royds Withy King. She expects there to be a series of claims in the coming years as a result of using incorrect work equipment.“If someone gets injured because the employer has not done a risk assessment, it falls back to the employer and we are looking at potential personal injury,” she says. “Now it is not a short-term thing, there needs to be a lot more thought put into it and this does involve expenses, which is why a lot of employers are trying to punt it down the road.”In or out of the office, employers have the same obligations. John Palmer of Acas says there should be good communication between the two sides, especially if there is increased stress.“If an employee is pregnant… the rules broadly apply like they would in any workplace, for example carrying out a risk assessment,” he says. “One possible upside to this is that for some pregnant women, working from home could bring benefits, such as not having to commute and having instant access to everything in their house.”With children at home the working day is much less coherent for many parents and can lead to unintended interruptions, as witnessed on TV news shows recently. Covering childcare has been a significant stress, and the prospect of children returning to schools will be a relief for many. Legally, you can take time off to look after any dependants, but it is typically unpaid, and really intended to cover short-term emergencies.“If an employee can’t make childcare arrangements that work in harmony with their job, they are likely to be able to take what is called ‘time off for dependants’, which is generally unpaid leave,” says Palmer. “It might also be their situation could qualify for furlough leave, too. What employers need to be careful of, is that they do not end up discriminating against some groups when they could have been a little more flexible.”The insurance industry has said employees now working from home will continue to be insured under their home policies but this may change. “If you are an office-based worker and are working from home as a result of the pandemic, your home insurance cover will not be affected. You do not need to contact your insurer to update your documents or extend your cover,” says the Association of British Insurers (ABI).This is to be reviewed on 1 September. It explains: “If you are able to return to work, but are choosing to work from home more often, then you may need to inform your insurer. Check your policy documents or insurer’s website, and if you are still unsure, check with your insurer.”While many workers will be spending the rest of the year in their back room, others will be going back to the office. But many will not want to return to the “dead time” of commuting, or face the risk of contracting coronavirus while there. The Law Society, the professional body for solicitors, has said that before coronavirus, employees would have had to return but now they are entitled to ask questions about what safeguards are in place. Under the government’s plans to get employees back to work, businesses have a duty to have a risk assessment.“If you’re unsure whether the workplace is safe, ask your employer to explain the measures they’re implementing to bring the risks down to an acceptable level,” the Law Society recommends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0976d0f6eaccdb65b74bc984353d69cc890443/0_209_6720_4034/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0aa92862c07fdf42df02ad8b1a4f44","title":"james dean bradfield im not sure musicians telling people who to vote for helps","story":"The Manic Street Preacher on protest music, Wales’s response to Covid-19 and why you party with ballet dancers at your perilJames Dean Bradfield was born in 1969, and brought up in the south Wales valleys. He formed the Manic Street Preachers at school in 1986 with friends Nicky Wire, Sean Moore and Richey Edwards after Edwards went missing in 1995, the trio carried on, achieving both critical and commercial success. Next month, Bradfield releases his second solo LP, Even in Exile, with lyrics written by the Welsh poet Patrick Jones.How has lockdown been for you?I didn’t leave my corner of Cardiff for months, or see my dad every week, as I always do, so that was hard. He’s 77, and still working as a gravedigger. I’ve also got young kids, eight and four, so I’ve been like the headmaster patrolling the corridors at home. I’ve also been running a lot while listening to music: lots of the Bad Plus, Public Enemy, George Benson, Rush, old C86 compilations. Blondie are amazing to exercise to. You imagine yourself being caught between punk and Jane Fonda.How would you describe Jara’s protest music?It’s quite shocking at first because it’s very beautiful and graceful. It shows that protest music doesn’t have to be someone shouting “Motherfuckers, stand down!” Even in American protest music from the same time, by Bob Dylan or Phil Ochs, there are moments when they go four-to-the-floor, straight in the eye. Not here. Jara shows us that protest music can be a psalm or a prayer to be more inclusive, or to understand history a bit more. That feels right for today. After all, you don’t have to find your enemy to have a fight any more, do you?You’ve lived back in Wales for a decade. Wales’s devolved government has a more cautious approach to Covid-19 than England. How have you felt about that?Strangely proud. Looking at pictures of our beaches next to England’s and going: “Yes! We’ve stuck to the rules!” I was like, ah, this is what it’s like to feel old.Your home valleys were also one of the biggest Brexit-voting areas in the UK. Why, do you think?Because politicians based their referendum campaigns on hectoring and preaching. Look at anyone who wins an election, whether it be Clement Attlee or Margaret Thatcher – you shouldn’t mention those two names in the same breath, of course – they built their victories on addressing people’s hopes and fears. Wales’s government have done well in their response to the virus for similar reasons, and, importantly, they’ve not scared people too much. Unless you’re a mad, rightwing libertarian who has a problem with wearing a face mask, that is. That’s beyond the realms of my thinking.What do you think of punk-rock bands today, like Idles, who talk about politics onstage?I think there’s been a generational shift. I never felt we were qualified for it – I remember being criticised for not speaking up about the Iraq war, and saying we wanted to let the songs speak for us instead. It’s not that I think speaking up is wrong – I liked Red Wedge a lot in the 80s – but I’m not sure musicians telling people who to vote for is going to help. It worked for us to talk about books we liked, or artists and thinkers, and excite fans that way. For me to preach about politics right now would be like watching a dad at a disco doing a drop-shoulder move.In April, the Manics announced a free gig for NHS workers this December. What drove that decision? Obviously, we planned it on a hope and a promise, and all promoters have second and third dates planned in. But we really wanted to give these people a party.

Also, I don’t want to stereotype, but people who work in hospitals love a good lash-up. They need it! The only people I’ve seen worse are ballet companies on tour – these huge, tattooed, pierced roadies from south London would always warn us about them – or the time we crossed over with the Riverdance company.

And for good reason.After four months of cardboard cutouts warming the seats of silent stadiums across the UK, spectators finally returned in the flesh to sport for a friendly county cricket fixture between Surrey and Middlesex at the Oval.“It has been the highlight of the lockdown, as it were,” said Neil Fraser, who attended alongside his partner, Jenny. “This has been something that I’ve missed – we’ve been waiting for cricket to come back and this is the first time we have been out in the whole time.”They were two among an exclusive and fortunate group. Surrey county cricket club boasts 13,500 members and the Oval, its home ground, has a capacity of 25,500, yet just 1,000 seats were available. Surrey Cricket had been uncertain about the number of fans who would even be interested, but on Wednesday morning the dozen staff members manning the phones were overwhelmed by 10,000 calls placed in the first hour alone.“I rang quite a few times, got horrible lift music for half an hour,” said John, a 15-year-long club member from Chelmsford, Essex. “I complained a bit, and that worked. At 3 o’clock I got through. Ten thousand calls in the first hour! I don’t know how I got a ticket in the end.”By midday, most fans had arrived and they were sequestered in the cosy 1845 stand, separated two seats apart in each row and with every other row of seats left vacant. After months of artificial background noise at sporting events, even the smallest facets of a real, live crowd were to be cherished: the spontaneous oohs after a peachy cover drive, the volume of applause rising and falling according to the crowd’s enthusiasm in the moment. Even the ambient chatter felt like a positive feature rather than an annoyance in these strange times. Another sign of life.Those who made the trip left their fears behind, but the walkways of the Oval were still a microcosm of a society that does not agree. As fans trickled in, some marked their arrival by tearing their masks from their faces and they insisted on speaking with voices unmuffled. Others rushed to ensure that their masks were tightly fastened as soon as they noticed this journalist approaching.Sue, a member since her retirement four years ago, aligned firmly into the former camp. Asked if she was at all wary of being among people again, she immediately shook her head.“Not in the slightest,” she said. “I couldn’t wait to get here. I’ve been out and about as and when I’ve been allowed to. Throughout the whole process, I made a point of going out every day, walking a lot.Throughout the day, fans acted sensibly, keeping their distance in the crowd and beyond. Richard Gould, Surrey’s chief executive, suggested that club members were even more incentivised to be reasonable in order to ensure that they could return once more. As they told stories of their affinity to the Oval, many seemed to agree. One fan, who did not wish to be named, likened his return to “coming home”.“On a hot summer’s day, there is nothing nicer than sitting and watching cricket,” said John of Chelmsford. “Even if it’s boring as hell, it’s still lovely to be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9bc7c117745e0e6877c3bf130aad251c3dc0ef/0_331_6972_4185/master/6972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27f865dc59ad4b214a802ebb78c34e47","title":"can virtual reality really get you fit","story":"Our writer dons a headset and turns boxer, air guitarist and saber wielder in a bid to shake off his lockdown lassitudeLike many people, by May I was having a difficult time in lockdown: struggling with homeschooling stressing about work tired out by Zoom calls comfort eating drinking too much and feeling nervous about venturing out for short walks, let alone exercise.And then I strapped a computer to my face and gave thin air a damn good pummelling and everything improved a little. Virtual reality’s role in helping me to clamber out of the lockdown blues has changed the way I think about the technology and its potential to play a meaningful role in day-to-day life.I’ve written a fair bit about virtual reality (VR) as a medium in the past, testing headsets and apps and interviewing their creators with curiosity and an open mind. Yet my professional interest never ignited the desire to spend my own time using technology that – by necessity in its current iteration – isolates you from the people around you. (Cue the obligatory joke: that’s what smartphones are for, right?)The shift started in May, with an impulse purchase of an Oculus Quest headset and a fitness app called BoxVR. It’s essentially Guitar Hero meets boxercise: you jab, hook and uppercut glowing orbs and duck or dodge barriers, all of which fly at you in sync with a soundtrack ranging from rock, pop and dance to drum’n’bass.I’m not a boxer. Less “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee” and more “pant like a water buffalo, flap like a tired kitten” in truth. But over six weeks, BoxVR became a daily habit and, as good exercise should, provided the spark to go walking, eat healthily and leave the giant crate of cider untouched most nights (also a lockdown impulse purchase).Other people clearly see something in BoxVR too: in July, the London tech startup behind it, FitXR, announced a funding round of £6m from a group of venture capital investors plus the government’s Innovate UK agency.The company’s co-founders, Sam Cole and Sameer Baroova, met at business school before founding FitXR in 2016, drawing on Cole’s background in finance and Baroova’s career as a games developer.“We don’t see ourselves as a gaming studio, but as a fitness company,” says Cole, adding that FitXR was set up in the belief that “the next computing platform after the smartphone was going to be some kind of mixed reality headset” and that “fitness everywhere would be completely transformed”.Video companies love this kind of talk, but in recent years, the outlook for VR technology has looked distinctly mixed. In 2016, a research firm, IHS Markit, predicted that by 2020 there would be 81m VR headsets in use globally.And now? In May this year, research firm Omdia, which acquired IHS Markit’s tech ision in 2019, estimated that the current base is about 26m units. Sales have been disappointing, certainly compared with the bullish expectations when the Oculus Rift headset kicked off the modern VR hardware generation. Facebook bought its maker for $2bn in 2014 two years after a kickstarter funding campaign and the headset went on commercial sale in 2016.Sluggish sales tipped VR sharply into what the famous “Hype Cycle” theory from Gartner, a firm of analysts, describes as the “trough of disillusionment”, although 2019 and 2020 have seen it progress to the next stage of that cycle: the “slope of enlightenment” – with fitness one of the app genres doing the lifting.Facebook’s Oculus Quest, released in May 2019, was hailed as a big step forward. It was a standalone headset – you didn’t have to connect it to a computer or console – and it was priced at a relatively affordable £400 to £500. In its first year, Quest owners bought £80m worth of games and apps from its official store.“The Oculus Quest really reflected an inflection point in the industry, where suddenly the technology was far more accessible and intuitive than it had ever been before,” says Cole. “I could send a headset back to my mum in New Zealand and she could take it out of the box and operate it.”The Quest, together with Sony’s PlayStation VR and digital game store Steam (which supplies games for other VR headsets) have created an increasingly healthy market for developers and startups to target. Games remain the dominant category, but fitness has emerged as another key genre.Punchy alternatives to BoxVR include Creed: Rise to Glory and The Thrill of the Fight, which offer animated opponents to fight. In the US, veteran VR producer Within Unlimited has launched a workout app called Supernatural, using a gym-style subscription ($19 a month or $179 a year).There’s also a burgeoning category of games with fitness as a secondary feature, many of which go down the “Guitar Hero but with punching and hand-wiggling” music-rhythm route.Synth Riders, Audioshield, Audio Trip and Beat Saber (see below) are just four examples of VR games that will see you work up a sweat. The latter sold a million copies in its first nine months, its developer was acquired by Facebook in November 2019, and it has since passed the 2m sales milestone, while licensing music from big artists such as Green Day, Imagine Dragons and Timbaland.There is also an emerging community around VR fitness, from YouTubers posting their BoxVR and Beat Saber workouts, to a website called the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise.It rates VR apps and games based on their calorie burn per minute, comparing them to real exercises such as tennis, rowing and cycling.According to its ratings, BoxVR burns a tennis-like six to eight calories a minute for the average user, although its top rating goes to a version of Audioshield that is equivalent to a bike ride, burning 10 to 13 calories a minute.Calorie burn seems to be the prime metric for VR fitness in 2020, which I’m a little wary of, having jumped on the step-counting, food-logging, exercise-tracking app bandwagon in past attempts to get fit, which all saw me slip off it within a few months.For me, the appeal of VR fitness is that it’s fun, yes, but also that I can lose myself in a workout in a way I struggle to in other contexts. The physical isolation of wearing a headset, it turns out, suits me well.“That’s really the power of it,” says Cole. “You can enter that flow-like state. Some people get that when they’re running: they can really get lost in a run with a great Spotify playlist on and forget that they’ve been out there for half an hour pounding the pavement. For other people, that’s an impossible task.”His words are mirrored by those of another VR fitness co-founder, Bojana Knezevic of Holodia, which makes technology for VR workouts on rowing machines, exercise bikes and elliptical machines at home or in the gym.“The combination of the full immersion, helping people forget they are working out, and the gamification and competition, motivating them to push harder, is why VR fitness appeals more and more to the general population,” she says.Knezevic identifies the evolution of VR hardware as a key reason for the growth of fitness apps and games, but thinks further developments will come from creativity – looking beyond traditional real-world workouts.“VR fitness innovation is driven, on one side, by VR hardware developments. You have headsets that are super comfortable, don’t make you sweat and have no fogging issues, as was the case in the past. And they are affordable,” she says.“On the other hand, the freedom that VR content development gives means you don’t have to limit yourself to traditional sports: you can make your body move and work out in any way you want. This is where creativity, fantasy combined with sports science, comes in and drives further innovation.”The next wave of VR fitness invention may well be social, too. Holodia and Supernatural have companion apps that compare your scores with friends, while BoxVR has global rankings for each of its workouts and a multiplayer mode. My proudest lockdown moment so far has been breaking into the top 50 of its “Unspoken” metal-soundtracked class.Cole says FitXR has big plans on this front. “You will use the product and feel closer to exercising in a group setting,” he says. “BoxVR and other applications are really just scratching the surface. I think social and multiplayer applications are going to be a really important part of how VR scales up.”As for actual gyms, they may play a role too, as they open again after lockdown. Knezevic says that in Asia and the Middle East there is already “a new boutique concept of VR gyms” with headsets in their studios plus programmes of virtual workouts, classes and coaching for members at home.“They are adjusting their business models, monetising VR fitness and making sure they are relevant in the future,” she says. Cole, meanwhile, notes that gyms will always have more equipment on site than the average exerciser could afford to have at home.However, he envisages a future where people might take a mixed-reality headset – one that lets them see their surrounding environment – to the gym and use it to show them how to use particular weights or machines.As I write this, the gym that I belong to is about to reopen and, despite my new VR boxing habit, I can’t wait to get back there, a mark of how well it has created a real-world community among its members.VR isn’t a gym-killer just yet, but it can be an alternative for some people and a complement for others. For this buffalo-panting (but rapidly less kitten-flappy) amateur pugilist, this increase in choice feels like a healthy thing.Boxercise in the virtual world to a soundtrack from emerging artists, taking in rock, pop and dance, but also metal and drum’n’bass.The music game Facebook “liked so much it bought the company”. You swish a pair of virtual sticks to break boxes in time to music.Already a popular console game, Dance Central works just as well as a VR title, with 32 tracks to learn the steps to and work up a sweat.There are more than 200 tai chi workouts to try in this game, which is a good way to prepare for doing tai chi in the real world without falling on your face.If BoxVR’s glowing orbs aren’t your thing, try this game’s fleshier boxers. The fights may be virtual, but the sweat you work up is very real.This music game is all about the arm waving, as you try to follow lines (or “rails”) of coloured spheres. Joyful, even if you look ridiculous to onlookers.Another “hit glowing objects flying at your face” VR music game, but with a killer soundtrack: Lady Gaga, Deadmau5 and Skrillex are all included.US-only for now, but one of the most serious attempts yet to marry music and fitness, with new workouts daily and a mass of stats charting your progress.The TV show Hole in the Wall saw Lycra-clad contestants contorting to fit through people-shaped holes in an onrushing wall. This is that, but in VR. Lycra optional.Still in “early access” on digital games store Steam to get feedback from players, PowerBeatsVR has lots of promise with its punching, dodging and squatting.

Frank Hill, 60, said he remembered watching footage of Lewis and other civil rights marchers being beaten.“I had to come back and see John Lewis cross the bridge for the last time,” Hill told the Associated Press. “It’s funny to see the state troopers here to honor and respect him rather than beat the crap out of him.”As the wagon approached the bridge, members of the crowd shouted “Thank you, John Lewis!” and “Good trouble!”, the phrase Lewis used to describe his tangles with white authorities during the civil rights movement.Some crowd members sang the gospel song Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed on Jesus. Later, some onlookers sang the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcome and other gospel tunes.The wagon rolled over a carpet of rose petals, pausing in the summer heat atop the bridge over the Alabama River so family members could walk behind it. On the south side of the bridge, where Lewis was beaten in 1965, family members placed red roses, marking the spot where Lewis spilled his blood and suffered a head injury.As a military honor guard lifted Lewis’ casket from the horse-drawn wagon into an automobile hearse, Alabama state troopers, including some African American ones, saluted.Calls to rename the bridge for Lewis are increasing.On Sunday Kerry Kennedy, a human rights campaigner and daughter of the former US attorney general, senator and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy, with whom Lewis forged a strong friendship, told the : “I think it would be great because Edmund Pettus was a terrible white supremacist and there should not be anything named after him.”Pettus was a lawyer and Confederate general who became a US senator and leader in the Ku Klux Klan.“It would be a symbol to Selma and to our country and to the world that we recognise the violence of the past,” Kennedy said, “and we are going to atone for it and we are on our way to becoming a more perfect union – one where all people are respected and where every person is treated with dignity.”After the ceremonies in Selma, Lewis’ body was taken to the Alabama capitol to lie in repose, retracing the route marchers took in the days after Bloody Sunday to demand justice from Alabama governor George Wallace.Bertha Surles and Edna Goldsmith stood along the highway between Selma and Montgomery. Both carried signs, reading “Thank you”.“He fought for rights up unto his death,” said Surles, 70.She was in high school on Bloody Sunday and remembered watching footage of Lewis being beaten.“They didn’t give up and something good came from it. Still need some improvement, but something good came from it.”“John was willing to sacrifice life so we can have the freedom to vote,” said Goldsmith, who was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt. “We want to see him off with a bang.”A series of events began on Saturday in Lewis’ hometown of Troy, Alabama. He will lie in state at the US Capitol in Washington next week before a private funeral on Thursday at the historic Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, which the Rev Martin Luther King Jr once led."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7797ba4ab4ce5e8d625333b291531ecfff5c86a6/200_276_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a32a02bea709b5641d8b81b9c116db8","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

She has taken an enormous load on herself,” Kolesnikova said.Protests in support of opposition candidates are the biggest challenge in years to Lukashenko, amid anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights. As well as jailing his main election rivals, he has detained hundreds of people in a crackdown on dissent.Tikhanovskaya has also had to make sacrifices. Last week it was revealed that she had taken her children out of the country for their own safety, after she had nearly been driven out of the race by threats against her family. Her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, remains behind bars for taking part in a rally in May.“Yes, I was scared at first,” she said in a televised speech. “I know what depths this government can go to in order to preserve its place. But I am no longer scared.”At boisterous campaign rallies, Tikhanovskaya and Kolesnikova have been joined by Veronika Tsepkalo, a former Microsoft employee and campaign head for her husband, Valery Tsepkalo, who has also been turfed out of the race and fled the country with his children to Moscow last week, saying he had been warned that an order had been put out for his arrest.In a bombshell announcement this month, the three women said they would be uniting their campaigns, connecting what are seen as complementary electorates between wealthier urban voters and opponents of Lukashenko in the countryside.Lukashenko, a former collective farm director, has ruled the ex-Soviet country since 1994, suppressing and jailing opposition figures and holding elections not deemed free and fair by European observers. He is widely expected to use his influence over the electoral authorities to help win the August elections and the opposition has said they are worried that the vote could be rigged.Kolesnikova said they hammered out the decision to unite in just a quarter of an hour. “We decided it would be quicker for just three of us to talk,” she said. “We needed 15 minutes talking just the three of us, Svetlana, Veronika, and myself, in order to make a decision … And that was our victory.”The optics of the announcement also caught the public imagination. In photographs, together, Tsepkalo flashed a peace sign, Tikhanovskaya held up a fist and Kolesnikova formed her two hands into a heart. A surge of fan art has followed.“We believe that we are not of a second sort, that we stand equal to men and believe that we can win,” said Tsepkalo after the announcement, in a dig at Lukashenko, who has said politics should remain a sphere dominated by men.“Our constitution is not made for a woman,” he said. “Our society hasn’t matured to the point to vote for a woman.” He also referred to them as “poor things”.Tikhanovskaya has embraced her role as a reluctant candidate, saying she is not interested in running for politics but is doing so from a sense of duty.“I love my husband so I am continuing his cause,” she told a crowd of several thousand voters in a stump speech in Barysaw on Thursday. “I love my children and want them to grow up in a country where people don’t have their mouths shut. I love Belarusians, so I want to give them the possibility to choose.”She also appeared speaking in fluent English on a BBC report in a segment that so angered Lukashenko that he called for the news agency to be tossed out of the country, along with local reporters for RFERL."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46102f1328e90b3e142e50d02417b1e49e8b047/0_34_3916_2350/master/3916.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9c624c1d2189de6512f3b55227728a54","title":"coronavirus cases in papua new guinea double in days","story":"Port Moresby hospital hit by staff shortages after emergency department workers test positive, bringing case tally to 62Coronavirus cases in Papua New Guinea have nearly doubled in a weekend, with the emerging pandemic threatening to overwhelm the country’s already-fragile healthcare system.The pandemic has, so far, been largely suppressed in the archipelagic nation, with low infection rates and only one death – of an already seriously-ill patient – linked to Covid-19.But authorities fear persistent community transmission, particularly in the crowded capital Port Moresby, could soon see the virus running unchecked.A fortnight ago, the country had recorded just 11 cases of Covid-19. This jumped to 32 by Friday last week, and to 62 by Sunday.There are concerns, too, that the real spread of the virus is far greater than officially recorded. Outside Port Moresby, where the bulk of cases have been confirmed, testing is “very limited”, according to the government.And there are continuing concerns about the country’s main hospital, Port Moresby General after the onsite laboratory where Covid-19 tests were being conducted suffered an outbreak this month. The government has ordered an inquiry into how staff working with samples became infected, and now two emergency department staff have reportedly tested positive.Staff have repeatedly raised concerns about their own safety, a lack of adequate personal protective equipment and staff shortages sparked by the need to quarantine some health workers.The hospital’s chief executive, Dr Paki Molumi, said patient care had been affected by the shortages and urged emergency department workers not to be deterred by the virus.“Our challenge is to continue to attend to all normal emergencies to save more lives, and at the same time ensure we and our patients are safe from Covid-19” Molumi said.A statement posted online by the hospital confirmed the emergency department would be moved to a foyer, which is “ventilated by open air and spacious”. Consultation clinics and pharmacy services will be moved to the hospital carpark in coming days.Government leaders have been warning for weeks PNG is ill-equipped to deal with an unchecked pandemic.The governor of Port Moresby, Powes Parkop, told Australia’s ABC that the capital faced “a situation that we dreaded, simply because of the impact of the virus and also our capacity to respond”.“We simply don’t have the capacity, we don’t have enough space in isolation facilities, in the hospital, we don’t have enough medical officers and we don’t have enough equipment,” he said.Face masks have already been made compulsory in the capital, and new social distancing measures are expected to be announced later this week, with possible restrictions on schools and public transport.A curfew from 10pm to 5am is also set to be re-introduced in Port Moresby, and domestic travel between cities or islands will be prohibited for all but essential reasons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1407dd943c0b7aaec782786c2b6f7360ea4dc362/443_214_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07b6a395f51bd6ae70611cf1a4505603","title":"jacinda arderns labour party gets strongest results yet in poll","story":"Jacinda Ardern has been handed a 40th birthday present in a new poll showing Labour is on track to cruise to victory in this year’s New Zealand election.“When it comes to the trends, we’ve seen a strong indication of support for what I would say is most likely to be the government’s response to Covid and the recovery plan,” Ardern told Radio NZ on Monday.If replicated at the ballot box on 19 September, Labour would be able to govern alone with a sizeable majority in the next parliament.If the poll numbers hold, Ardern would be the first leader to be able to govern with a clear majority since Jim Bolger’s booming win in 1990. Ardern said Labour’s internal polling showed a “a reasonably significant gap between (Labour) and the opposition” but they weren’t home and hosed.“I’m never complacent. I’m equally sceptical about the (polls) that are high as the ones that are low,” she said.“We have seen high support for the government ... but these are pretty extraordinary times. We’ll be working very, very hard to earn the trust of New Zealanders.”The result is a nightmare for Judith Collins, who was elevated to the opposition leadership a fortnight ago after Todd Muller stepped down less than two months after taking the job. Collins dismissed the result as a “rogue poll”.“I think we’ve done very, very well when you consider what we’ve dealt with in a week and a half,” she said.Campaign chief and deputy leader Gerry Brownlee agreed. “These numbers aren’t even in the same ballpark as our internal polls, other public polls and the hugely positive public response to our Leader Judith Collins,” he said.“Even with the most rigorous methodology, one in 20 polls will always be a rogue and this is clearly one of them.”Ardern said she would not be complacent and Labour would remain focused on what matters to voters.The prime minister now leads a coalition government with two minority parties – the populist New Zealand First on the right, and the Greens on the left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae8f70249e17a1e2585d586b459f9c80f22fa10/0_18_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f1c527516d0353835e11d836e7083e","title":"samoan chief slavery trafficking sentenced 11 years new zealand","story":"New Zealand-based Joseph Auga Matamata used 13 of his countrymen as slaves over a quarter of centuryA New Zealand-based Samoan chief has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for human trafficking and using 13 of his countrymen as slaves over a 25-year period.Joseph Auga Matamata, 65, also known as Villiamu Samu, was found guilty on 10 counts of trafficking and 13 counts of slavery following a five-week trial at the high court in Napier in March.During sentencing on Monday, Justice Helen Cull described Matamata’s offending as “abhorrent”, and ordered him to pay NZ$180,000 ($120,000) in reparations to his victims, RNZ reported, with the crown seizing half of Matamata’s assets last month in a bid to recover funds for the reparations.Matamata’s case is the first time anyone in New Zealand had been charged with both human trafficking and slavery simultaneously.The offending occurred between 1994 and April last year involving 13 Samoans from three villages on the island of Upolu. The youngest was just 12.The Crown argued there was a pattern to Matamata’s offending, with him bringing small groups of people to New Zealand over the 25-year period for his “own financial benefit”.He promised paid horticultural work or schooling in New Zealand and paid for their flights, visas and passports. But upon arrival they worked long hours, often seven days a week, for no pay while “bags of cash” were handed over to Matamata, Crown prosecutor Clayton Walker said.Matamata’s lawyer argued his chiefly status meant he had a responsibility to look after the whole family and it was typical in Samoan culture for all members of a household to pool their wages to help everyone.All 13 victims, who gave evidence through translators in court, said they worked without pay and had to do chores around Matamata’s house where they lived behind a tall perimeter fence and a locked gate.

Photograph: Orla Murray If there is any silver lining for Dublin to the health and economic disaster of the coronavirus pandemic, it has to be the emergence of measures to improve life for pedestrians and cyclists.Dublin City Council was first out of the traps in the repurposing of road space, annexing on-street parking spaces to widen footpaths and installing segregated cycle paths throughout the city, most notably on the Liffey quays, a scheme it had failed to get going for the previous eight years. The Office of Public Works (OPW) closed all but two of the Phoenix Park gates and banned all parking in the park at the end of March. Initially this was not a cycling or walking-driven measure, but to deter people from breaking the 2km travel restriction. However, as Covid-19 restrictions eased it became more about creating a better atmosphere for people to enjoy the park’s amenities. This was made most explicit when it decided not to reopen the peripheral gates as planned on June 29th to “curb traffic volumes” and maintain “safe, quiet, open spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy”.However, less than two weeks later, on a Thursday evening, the OPW announced the peripheral gates would reopen the following morning. This decision, made by the newly-appointed Minister of State for the OPW Patrick O’Donovan, was never about facilitating access to the park.What the closure of the gates did make less attractive was the use of the park as a rat run or a commuter route. That this was the real focus of the reversal was made clear when O’Donovan said the park was a thoroughfare in to the city for motorists from as far away as Longford and Westmeath. As the city and country reopens, perhaps it is understandable car users would rail against the very considerable changes to their pre-pandemic routine. Anne Crawford owns one of the few businesses operating in the Phoenix Park, an afterschool childcare service located in the special school on the north side of the park, close to the Hole in the Wall pub. She agrees the gate closures had limited impact on those coming to the park for leisure trips, but says they represented a serious inconvenience for working people.Many of these parents would come from the Navan Road direction, so would have no reason to venture into the centre of the park when they can use the Cabra and Ashtown gates, she said.“All the parents were going ballistic. These people sitting in traffic jams are the people going to work and paying taxes for the upkeep of the park, not the people sitting in the park on the €350 pandemic payment saying it’s all so lovely without the cars.”Crawford also runs afterschool facilities in nearby Castleknock and Ashtown and said traffic on the roads around both areas improved when the gates reopened. It would be “fair enough” to close the gates if there were adequate public transport options, she said. “The 37 bus only comes every 20 minutes and even before Covid the trains were packed and now the capacity is reduced. Working people need to be able to drive from one side of the park to the other, not just from Castleknock to Parkgate Street.”While the reopening of the gates has come as a great relief, she is concerned there may be attempts to reverse the decision. “I know the Green Party wants to close them again, but there will be uproar if they do, particularly when the schools – Mount Sackville and Castleknock College – reopen.”Crawford says she doesn’t really understand the argument for banning cars from peripheral roads and gates. “There are 1,700 acres here and only very few roads. You don’t have to be anywhere near the cars if you don’t want to be.” Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie said the singular focus on the gates as a solution to traffic management in the park has been misguided.“The conversation has become quite polarised, you’re either for or against the gates being open, when it should be a conversation about how to retain the best of the park while making sure it is accessible.”Sudden changes to park access without consultation and the continuing use of what had been billed as an emergency measure at the start of the pandemic travel restrictions, was what had annoyed residents, she said.“The OPW can’t just close the gates and hope for the best. They must develop a transport strategy for the park that includes public transport options to minimise people’s need to drive in the park. Last year they said they would conduct a mobility strategy for the park, they need to do that and start the public consultation on that as soon as possible.”Currie said she did not directly advise O’Donovan of her concerns regarding the gates but did speak in the Seanad on the matter.In Chapelizod, another community on the periphery of the park, some residents started an online petition, a week or so before the Minister made his decision, calling for the gates to be reopened. They cited traffic congestion outside and inside the park, as well as suggesting the lack of cars in the park would mean parts of the park would become “no-go areas due to their isolation”.The petition attracted more than 1,600 signatures, with more added since the gates reopened. Green Party Councillor Michael Pidgeon had earlier in the pandemic used the same online platform to seek support to end through traffic in the park. His petition secured more than 7,500 signatures and also continues to attract more. He was disappointed by O’Donovan’s decision. “The OPW had been extolling the benefits of keeping the gates closed, so it’s clear that the Minister ordered the change personally.”He agrees with Currie that an “onoff approach to the park isn’t in anyone’s interest” and says a short consultation process based on an options paper should be pursued. Pidgeon remains of the view that most people, on all sides of the debate, want to see less traffic in the park, insisting that the Phoenix Park is “not just some roads with trees on the side”.Not all local residents’ groups wanted the gates reopened. Pat Allison of the Navan Road Community Council, which has represented residents living to the north of the park for more than 50 years, said local traffic build-up appeared to be more a result of shops reopening than the gates being closed. Some of those arguing for the reopening may have simply wanted to avoid the M50 toll, she said. “The park is not a thoroughfare. It is a garden for the city of Dublin, much appreciated by many families confined to flatland.” MalahideIn a similar spirit of sunny optimism, Fingal County Council took the decision to pedestrianise a street in Malahide as part of its Covid- 19 mobility measures.While the council has converted parking spaces into footpaths to enable social distancing and improved cycling infrastructure in a number of towns and villages, New Street in the north Dublin village is the only one to be fully pedestrianised. The council’s senior executive engineer Andrew Nolan said the project involved considerable research, planning and consultation. Vehicular access for emergency services, deliveries, residents and businesses with private off-street parking was maintained, and additional parking spaces were provided in a nearby car park to compensate for the lack of on-street parking. There was “extensive daily on-site engagement with residents’ businesses” as planters and outdoor seating was installed, he said.Malahide Chamber of Commerce president Derek Fowler, who owns a pub on New Street, said the pedestrianisation has made a dramatic difference to the street. “It’s given it a real facelift and brought many more people to the street. I’ve never seen as many people on the street and they all seem really happy.”The street certainly looks vibrant, with an almost continental feel when the sun is shining and people are eating at outdoor tables. However, the atmosphere is somewhat dampened by the red and yellow Save Malahide Village posters in many windows.New Street pharmacist Áine McCabe said more than 40 local businesses wanted the pedestrianisation ended because of what they said are “significant knock-on traffic problems”.Shop Malahide, the advocacy group behind the campaign, is not “anti-cycling or anti-walking”, she insisted. “That could not be further from the truth. We very much welcome the visitors and residents who cycle and walk to the village and the custom they bring. We believe there is a balance to be struck between facilitating the needs of cyclists and ensuring that traffic flows easily.”The campaign had advocated for a “shared space” scheme, where car parking would be removed and space reallocated to cyclists and walkers. However consultation was “inadequate” she says and the scheme was presented as a “fait accompli” to businesses. “This is a plan they’ve had in their back pocket for a long time and they are using the guise of Covid to push it through.”The council’s director of services David Storey is flummoxed by the group’s opposition. “Shop Malahide were at a stakeholders’ meeting on May 19th where this was approved. They were in favour of it and subsequently they came out a week later and went a different route. We are the ones being vilified but they are the ones who changed their mind. It’s completely disingenuous.”The pedestrianisation of New Street is currently midway through a 10-week trial. “We are actively looking to work with stakeholders and if there was agreement, I would like to continue it beyond the 10 weeks,” Mr Storey said.The council began the Blackrock scheme at the end of May. After seeking public feedback on the progress to date, it said three quarters of submissions were positive and fewer than 20 per cent negative.The Dublin Cycling Campaign, always first in the crosshairs if there are shots to be fired at cyclists, has also encountered surprisingly little negative reaction.“There has been a small amount of negative feedback online, but the majority has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Oisín O’Connor, the campaign’s Dún Laoghaire Rathdown spokesman.“There was a bit of grumbling about traffic issues in Dún Laoghaire, but that’s to be expected while there are roadworks ongoing. They’ve had to close both sides of the coast road in some sections to be able to do the works safely. Once the works are finished, the one lane along the coast will reopen and things will get better as people get used to it.”Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham puts the success of the measures down to consultation, and maintaining accessibility.“There has to be engagement with stakeholders, meaningful consultation with traders if any of these schemes are going to work. In Blackrock, traders could see wider footpaths for queuing outside shops were needed, and everyone got a new bike during lockdown, it was like Christmas,” he said.“So it was easy to get across the logic of better spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. But crucially, even though it is one way, there is still ample street parking and accessibility has been maintained.”Dublin City Council, which trialled the pedestrianisation of several streets around Grafton Street at the weekend, has not had to deal with any serious opposition to its pedestrian and cycle measures so far, apart from the odd legal letter from multistorey car park owners. However, as Fingal and the OPW have seen, opposition might be festering, even if the sores have yet to break out.Suggestions that could change Dublin for the better"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: Litter in space is a growing problem, and represents a long-standing indifference to caring for the environmentMinister wants local authorities to re-orientate streets towards pedestrians, cyclists and public transportIreland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe HSE is taking a legal action against the State’s health service regulator to challenge an order to reduce the number of beds at a second Co Cork nursing home.The health service has brought the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) to court over a reduction in the number of registered beds at the 53-bed Midleton Community Hospital by three.It is the second HSE-run nursing home in Co Cork to be subject to a District Court action by the executive this year.The HSE previously brought a legal action over a direction to reduce the number of beds at Clonakilty Community Hospital permitted by the nursing home regulator.The case is due for mention in Mallow District Court on Monday.Hiqa declined to comment on the case. A spokeswoman for the HSE said that as the matter was before the courts, it would be inappropriate to comment.ConcernsThe regulator has raised concerns about the number of multi-occupancy rooms at the Midleton nursing home in inspection reports over recent years.In the most recent report, published in March following an inspection in October 2019, Hiqa inspectors found that there had been insufficient progress made in improving the quality of life for residents in two large multi-occupancy rooms, six living in one and seven living in another.The watchdog said that the two rooms also functioned as corridors to access the two main day rooms in that part of the centre.“Many residents in the centre still did not have access to adequate communal and day space, could not store many personal possessions and could not personalise their living space,” Hiqa said in the inspection report.“The lived experience of these residents was adversely impacted on by the inevitable institutional practices that prevail in such environments.”Midleton Community Hospital was one of 19 HSE-run care facilities of older people that Hiqa warned the HSE and Department of Health in mid-March were at “high risk” during the coronavirus pandemic because of the challenge in isolating residents to prevent the spread of the disease.“Our assessment considered the combination of the physical premises within which these centres are accommodated and the number of residents living in these centres – combined to create a situation where isolating for the purpose of preventing the spread of infection is extremely difficult and nearly impossible,” Hiqa chief inspector Mary Dunnion told the HSE.DeathsAn internal HSE report showed no confirmed or suspected coronavirus deaths at Midleton.Nursing homes have been asked to increase the percentage of single-occupancy rooms in their facilities, though the then minister for health Simon Harris signed a statutory instrument in 2016 delaying a regulation to have 80 per cent single-room occupancy until 2021.Meeting the regulation has proven a challenge for some nursing homes, particularly older care facilities like the HSE-run nursing homes in Midleton and Clonakilty.The Department of Health told the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee last month that it would be difficult to meet this regulation given the impact of the pandemic on the construction sector.“The HSE was already challenged to make it in respect of all facilities,” said Jim Breslin, secretary general of the department.Everything you need to know about the

Photograph: Arthur EllisPress22Almost 6,000 air passengers are flying into Ireland every day, with nearly a third of arrivals travelling from the UK, latest official figures disclose.While numbers are dramatically lower than normal for the time of year, there has been a steady increase over recent weeks in visitors arriving through Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.In the week July 13th to July 19th, at least 36, 931 passengers touched down at Dublin Airport, from 35 different countries, including the UK (10,743), Spain (4,965), France (2,137) and the Netherlands (2,041).Some 1,122 passengers arrived from the US at Dublin Airport during the period.The overall number of arrivals was up almost 30 per cent from the previous week (28,603) and up nearly 60 per cent on the preceding week (23,156), when more flights were put on at the beginning of the month.The numbers only cover those who are visiting Ireland and do not include other passengers who are transferring through Dublin onto onward flights.During the same week, some 2,846 passengers arrived at Cork Airport –- more than half (1,566) from the UK, with Spain (450), Poland (363) and France (120) the next most popular departure countries. Overall weekly arrival numbers at Cork have increased almost 65 per cent since the first week of the month (1,731).At Shannon Airport, weekly passenger numbers jumped more than 80 per cent over the same time period, from 836 to 1,522. Again, the UK (772) accounted for the largest number of arrivals, followed by Spain (332), Poland (238) and Lithuania (70).Parliamentary questionThe figures were released by Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport Eamon Ryan in response to a parliamentary question by Kerry TD Michael Healy-Rae.Mr Ryan said State airports remained open during the Covid-19 crisis “to ensure critical supply chains have been able to remain operational, and citizens have been able to return home”.He was unable to provide a breakdown of the arrivals into Ireland by those who were returning home and those who were foreign visitors.“While our three State airports have seen some increases in operations since more passenger flights resumed on the first of July, passenger numbers still remain low,” he said. At Dublin Airport, nine million passengers are expected in 2020 (compared to over 32 million passengers in 2019).He said numbers at both Cork and Shannon were down by about 90 per cent over the same time last year.Mr Ryan was also unable to detail the original departure countries of nearly 14,000 passengers who arrived in Ireland through sea ports in recent weeks.Between June 29th and July 12th, some 10,046 passengers disembarked ferries from the UK at Dublin Port. Another 2,264 arrived at Rosslare from the UK, while 1,483 visitors got off ferries from Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain at either Rosslare or Cork.Last week, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney suggested further travel restrictions could be introduced for visitors arriving from Covid-19 “hot spots”.Currently, visitors from all but 15 European countries and territories on the so-called “green list” published earlier this month only have to fill out a passenger locator form and agree to spend 14 days in quarantine at a confirmed address on arriving in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"There is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Tyler HicksThe New York TimesThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has topped 16 million.According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, the US leads the count with more than 4.1 million confirmed cases, followed by 2.3 million in Brazil and 1.3 million in India.The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a record number of 284,196 new cases of the disease worldwide on Friday and 284,083 new cases on Saturday – the highest volume since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.Here are updates on the pandemic from across the world:Quarantine rowSpain’s government has insisted the country is safe for tourists and Spaniards, after the UK on Sunday abruptly imposed a two-week quarantine on travellers returning from Spain, a decision that filled holidaymakers with dismay. Meanwhile, an investigation by El País newspaper published on Sunday showed that Spain’s Covid-19 death toll could be nearly 60 per cent higher than the official figure of 28,432.In the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported 4,163,892 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 64,582 cases from its previous daily count, and said the number of deaths from the disease had risen by 929 to 145,942. Prior to Sunday the US had recorded more than 1,000 deaths a day from Covid-19 for five days running.The US state of Florida recorded 9,300 new coronavirus cases, becoming the second state after California to overtake New York, which was the worst-hit state in terms of cases at the start of the US outbreak, according to a Reuters tally. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the Senate are set to unveil a $1 trillion US coronavirus relief Bill on Monday that includes reduced federal unemployment benefits, with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin saying he believes they can work with Democrats to move quickly on the legislation.Meanwhile, the health minister of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, Dr Jesus Grajeda, has died, Chihuahua’s governor said on Sunday, nearly two weeks after Dr Grajeda was hospitalised with Covid-19. Tourist seasonThe latest uptick in cases in many European countries appears to have coincided with the start of the summer tourist season. The surge highlights the dilemma facing policymakers: on one hand they fear reimposing a shutdown that has devastated their economies, but on the other they worry the return of mass travel will trigger a second wave of the pandemic.In North Korea, leader Kim Jong-un said he believes “the vicious virus” may have entered the country, and placed the city of Kaesong, near the border with South Korea, under total lockdown after a person was found with suspected Covid-19 symptoms.Mr Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a “critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country”, the North’s KCNA state news reported.A person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that ides the two Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month with symptoms of Covid-19, KCNA reported.“An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the South three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus, returned on July 19th after illegally crossing the demarcation line,” KCNA said.China reported 46 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, its highest such daily tally in more than a month, as it took steps to stem recent outbreaks that have infected more than 160 people at opposite ends of the country.China has recorded 83,830 cases and 4,634 deaths since the pandemic began. The National Health Commission said that 288 patients remain in treatment, including 18 in a critical condition.Record tollIn Australia, Victoria state recorded 10 deaths overnight – its highest such daily toll amid a continuing surge in cases.State premier Daniel Andrews said the deaths included seven men and three women, including a man in his 40s.Elsewhere, Vietnam reintroduced social distancing measures in the central city of Danang after the country reported four locally transmitted coronavirus cases over the past two days.Iran on Sunday reported another 216 fatalities and 2,333 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising its death toll to 15,700 from 291,172 known cases. The level of infection is “red” over most of Iran, as one in five deaths in the country is linked to Covid-19, deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said on state TV.Morocco will stop people entering and leaving some of its biggest cities from midnight to contain a surge in Covid-19 cases, the interior and health ministries said on Sunday. The cities to be locked down include the economic powerhouse of Casablanca as well as Tangier, Marrakech, Fez and Meknes. The country eased a nationwide lockdown a month ago, though international flights are still suspended, except for special flights by national airlines carrying Moroccans or foreign residents. On Sunday, the Moroccan health ministry said 633 new Covid-19 cases were recorded, one of its biggest daily rises so far, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 20,278, with 313 deaths. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: David Dee DelgadoNew York TimesPresident Donald Trump is oh so proud of having mastered the ability to intone, “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.” But the more pressing issue is whether he is a person who can master talking to women through a TV camera without sounding like a caveman. We continually debate whether Trump is a madman, but there’s no doubt he’s a Mad Man. He’s a ring-a-ding-ding guy, stuck in a time warp redolent of Vegas with the Rat Pack in 1959, talking about how “broads” and “skirts” rate. He was in his element bro-ing out with Dave Portnoy in an interview for Barstool Sports that aired on Friday.Trump’s idea of wooing the women’s vote, which is decisive in this election, was to tweet out a New York Post story headlined “Joe Biden’s disastrous plans for America’s suburbs” with the directive: “The Suburban Housewives of America must read this article.”Clearly, the 74-year-old president thinks that American women are in the kitchen clutching their pearls, a la June Cleaver sheltered in the ’burbs in their gingham aprons waiting for their big, brave breadwinners to come home after a hard day’s work manhandling their secretaries.Trump believes that the coveted electoral cohort that used to be known as soccer moms are actually sucker moms, naive enough to fall for his shtick that the unleashed forces of urban America are marching towards their manicured lawns. How perfect that the president – whose personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, got in trouble over his boss’s porn-star payout – wants to protect the desperate housewives of America.In a speech on drug prices last Friday, Trump took his strange brand of feminism for a spin, pausing while he talked about middlemen profiting in the Big Pharma arena to say “and women, I guess”. On the Bulwark, a conservative website, Sarah Longwell wrote about her three years’ worth of focus groups with women who voted for Trump in 2016. Lack of compassionShe found that they chose Trump over Hillary Clinton because they did not like Clinton and because they felt that Bill Clinton’s bad behaviour with women cancelled out Trump’s bad behaviour with women. But the relationship with women voters has soured, not only because of his pugnacity and bullying but also because of his lack of compassion and competence dealing with the coronavirus and painful issues about race.“They don’t see Trump as someone who can protect them from the chaos,” Longwell wrote. “They think he’s the source of it.” And his party is on board with the antediluvian vibe. R-Misogyny. Even on the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, Republicans can’t help themselves. It feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Cheney in it, but it was disturbing to see a bunch of MAGA bros in Congress beat up on Liz Cheney because, among other offences to the cult of Trump, she defended Dr Anthony Fauci and shaded Trump on his denial regarding the virus by tweeting a picture of her father in a mask with the hashtag “realmenwearmasks”.One Trump disciple in the House, Republican Matt Gaetz, tweeted that “Liz Cheney has worked behind the scenes (and now in public) against @realDonald Trump and his agenda.” He added, “Liz Cheney should step down or be removed.” Donald Trump jnr chimed in on Twitter, “We already have one Mitt Romney, we don’t need another.” (Of course, while it feels strange to be typing something positive in a sentence with the word Trump in it, Donald Trump jnr was right in his second point: “We also don’t need the endless wars she advocates for.” That point was echoed by the president on Twitter. I would never agree with a Cheney’s mindless hawkishness.)‘F***ing bitch’As Republicans sniped, one Democrat soared. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, tried to slap down Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A reporter overheard him muttering that the congresswoman was “a f***ing bitch” as Yoho walked away after having an argument with her about crime and policing on the steps of the Capitol. Yoho denies he said it.The youngest woman to ever serve in Congress is so full of natural political talent, burning so bright, that the 2020 field seems dull next to her lustre. It was a remarkable moment on Capitol Hill, where for years superachieving women have let such sexist remarks slide.She went to the House floor on Thursday and schooled Yoho the Yahoo and the retrograde crowd. “Mr Yoho mentioned that he has a wife and two daughters,” she said. “I am two years younger than Mr Yoho’s youngest daughter. I am someone’s daughter, too.” She added, “I am here because I have to show my parents that I am their daughter and that they did not raise me to accept abuse from men.”Showing her skill in a generational dimension foreign to Congress until now, AOC posted a video of herself on Instagram Stories strutting to the rap tune Boss Bitch by Doja Cat, her long hair whipping to the music, with the Capitol in the background. “I’m a bitch and a boss, I’m a-shine like gloss.” She captioned it: “Shine on, fight for others, and let the haters stay mad.”And that’s the way you make Paleolithic men understand that they are history.

Officially, he was removed for failing to deal with issues in the newsroom. But the editor’s supporters said the sacking was “clear interference” and an attempt to pressure the news site to toe a pro-government line.Fears over the future of Index were ignited in March when Miklos Vaszily, businessman that backs prime minister Viktor Orbán, bought a 50 per-cent stake in the firm that controls Index’s advertising and revenue. Although Mr Vaszily denies wanting to exert any editorial influence, his critics claim that he helped transform Origo, another Hungarian website, into a pro-government organisation.Once news of the mass resignation from Index broke, protesters took to the streets in Budapest on Friday evening.Addressing the demonstrators Andras Fekete-Gyor, leader of Momentum, an opposition party, said the “journalists of Index had demonstrated the value of having a moral backbone in this country.”But the protests may have little effect. Mr Orban and his party have a strong position in the Hungarian parliament, and in the past have proved impervious to the frequent accusations that they are undermining Hungarian democracy. The Hungarian government has also always denied that it poses a threat to the country’s free media.Marianna Bíró, a journalist at Index told The Sunday : Today, the political power in Hungary denies the function of journalists. The media only has one weapon left in this massacre: decency.”Balázs Pándi, another employee who walked out, said: This isn\u0027t the first time a cold shower has been deployed. The question is how long this will be tolerated.”Index has become regarded as a bastion of independent journalism in a Hungarian media landscape increasingly dominated by print and broadcast media with close ties to Fidesz, the governing party led by Viktor Orban, the prime minister.The hollowing out of independent media inside Hungary comes amid a push to spread Mr Orban\u0027s message abroad, uncovered today by The Sunday .An investigation found a slew of English-language websites promoting the message and illiberal philosophy of Mr Orban, raising fears that Hungary is following in the “disinformation” footsteps of authoritarian governments.Alleged propaganda websites, with connections to the Hungarian government, masquerade as legitimate news sources, purporting to bring Hungarian and regional news to an international audience.Remix News, one of the websites in question, is, for example, often linked to from the About Hungary Facebook page, which is run by the Hungarian state.Based in Budapest it is, according to its own information, an organisation that offers “news and commentary from Central Europe”. But to its critics it is one of a number of websites with opaque backgrounds allegedly spreading propaganda supporting the government of Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, beyond Hungary’s borders while posing as legitimate news sources.Their presence has prompted allegations that Hungary is following in the footsteps of autocratic regimes such as Russia, Iran and China by using bogus news websites to disseminate pro-government stories.“Hungary has become a regional disinformation power, and certainly Hungary is expanding its own misinformation machinery,” said Szabolcs Panyi, a journalist working for Direkt36, a non-profit investigative journalism centre in Budapest. “I’m not aware of a similar country doing this apart from the likes of Russia and China.”A quick click away from Remix is V4NA. A UK-registered company founded in 2018 by Hungary’s then ambassador to London it turns out stories each day, many of which share a similar theme to those found on Remix. Articles attacking migration, the EU and George Soros, the Hungarian-born financier whom the Orban government regards as an enemy of state, proliferate.The stories reflect issues that lie close to the heart of the Hungarian government. Since coming into power in 2010 Mr Orban’s Fidesz party has become a resolute opponent of migration, a fierce critic of Brussels and Mr Soros, and a proponent of what the prime minister has termed “illiberal democracy”.This has led to frequent clashes with Brussels and prompted widespread allegations that the Hungarian government is intent on eroding democratic norms and civil society in order to shape the country to its ideological designs—something it strenuously denies.“Orban plays to an international field, and he needs international allies in his fight against the EU,” said Agnes Urban, a media analyst at the Hungarian media watchdog Mertek Media Monitor. “This pro-government narrative about Hungary helps communicate his anti-democratic views.Barna Borbas, a Hungarian journalist who has written extensively about V4NA for the conservative newspaper Valasz Online, believes V4NA’s “goal is to make the messages and strategic goals of the Hungarian government more visible in Europe”.This is perhaps not surprising given that Arpad Harbony, one of Mr Orban’s key advisors and man sometimes called the “Hungarian Dominic Cummings”, has a share in V4NA, while V4NA’s parent company is part of the Central European Press and Media Foundation, a media-holding containing a number of pro-government newspapers and radio stations in Hungary. V4NA failed to respond to an interview request from The .Remix is owned by FWD Affairs, a “strategic communications and media agency” in Budapest, founded in 2010 by Patrick Egan, an American political consultant. Although appearing to keep a low profile in Hungary he has spoken at a number of events linked to Fidesz, which are, according to one expert on Hungarian affairs who preferred not to be named, the “darkest chambers of governmental propaganda”.In the past FWD Affairs has also carried out work for the prime minister’s office, winning, for example, a contract in 2015 “to support international communications activities”.Along with publishing Remix it also handles the English-language editing of a Hungarian-state backed website called Transylvania Now. Although designed primarily to promote Romania’s Transylvania region, which was once part of Hungary and still home to a large Hungarian population, the website has political content, often critical of the Romanian authorities while supporting the Hungarian government.Like V4NA, FWD is also a company that appears to shun publicity. Its website consists of one page, and offers no contact information other than a box in which to write a message. It also made no response to attempts by The  to contact it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shift home working could lead drop demand commuter belt homes","story":"The shift to working from home will lead to a drop in demand for properties in the commuter belt, estate agents have said.Companies are understood to be exploring ways to make their workforce more flexible with some analysts predicting a permanent shift in attitudes to the office.This will lead buyers to look further afield for a place to live as they prioritise space and rural living over proximity to the office, according to estate agents, and could mean the traditional commuter belt is “expanded or repositioned”. Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent based in North London, said that there was some evidence that people are moving further out, but that currently people leaving the commuter belt are being replaced by people moving out of cities like London.“People are saying they don’t mind being further out. They might be in East Anglia but if you are only going to the office once a week then that long journey won’t be such a burden,” he said.“I think longer-term, or even medium-term, there could be some price adjustment.”Ben Johnston, director of property buyer app Houso, said: “Since Covid-19, buyers have shown a clear interest in more rural properties. “It will be interesting to see where this leaves the commuter belt which is potentially going to expand or re-position due to this. “Whether commuter-belt residents opt for something more rural still remains to be seen, but there is definite interest in properties with a decent-sized garden, good internet and designated home-working spaces.”However, not all agents are convinced.Savills said that while a desire to improve work-life balance has become a major driver in the market, the Home Counties are currently seeing strong demand.Lawrence Bowles, a director at the firm, said: “Commuter locations that also have a strong local offering will continue to do well. They\u0027re convenient for getting to the London office two or three times a week while also offering the pubs, shops and primary schools people are looking for the rest of the time.“Dormitory towns, where you have a train station and not much else, will be less attractive than those offering a real community feel.”Henry Pryor, an independent buying agent, said: “I’m not expecting houses in the commuter belt to fall further than any other areas.

But from next Saturday, cinemas in Moscow are due to reopen, with the usual social-distancing protocols – and an additional, artistic restriction. The Russian culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, announced that only “light-hearted and simple” films will be screened, explaining that young people, who would be the first to return to cinemas, “want date movies”.It may be that the choice of cheerful films reflects Ms Lyubimova’s own taste. When she was appointed to her post in January, the BBC reported that the former television journalist had expressed outspoken views on culture in a 2008 blog, listing ballet and classical music among her pet hates, and observing: “I don’t understand a bloody thing about arthouse cinema.”Russian wits have been joking on social media that there is no better way to enforce social distancing at the flicks than an unrelieved diet of home-grown comedy. But a glance at the list of highest-grossing Russian films swiftly dispels any misapprehensions about the Russian soul thriving on gloom.Along with science fiction, sports films and a stiff dose of folklore-based fantasy, the list of commercially successful movies includes such comic gems as The Best Movie (2008), in which the hero dies from a drug overdose at his own wedding and has to persuade God to let him into heaven Our Russia: The Balls of Fate (2011), a caper involving the golden balls of Genghis Khan and the 2019 Serf, featuring an exasperated oligarch who tries to reform his wayward son by tricking him into believing that he is a serf in Imperial Russia.None of this, to be sure, sounds any more unpalatable than the reopening line-up trailed by our local Picturehouse. The offer includes a “compassion-filled unpicking of sexual politics”, an “epic and emotionally charged drama”, and “the latest in the terminally ill teen-romance subgenre” – options to which the golden balls of Genghis Khan seem an unexpectedly appealing alternative.Despite my instinctive resistance to the terminally ill teen-romance subgenre, I have never quite managed to embrace the idea that a feelgood film is the certain antidote to gloom, spleen, ennui, accidie or any of the multifarious forms of melancholy. Our household is ided on this subject. My partner, whose father’s favourite film was The Sound of Music, has inherited the paternal filmic sweet tooth. In his case, it manifests itself in an insatiable appetite for romcoms. His lockdown was vastly cheered by the alluringly incompetent courtship rituals of Normal People’s Marianne and Connell. Mine was – how can I put this? – not.I admit to doing the ironing to the gentle (and, at 80 episodes, almost interminable) comic jeopardy of Schitt’s Creek, but on the whole I am a firm believer in the homoeopathic approach to low spirits. “You think you’re feeling bad”, the theory goes: “Well, get a load of this!”As it happens, the Russian classics, from Tolstoy to Svetlana Alexievich, with their unsparing psychological realism and inexhaustible relish for the hammer-blows of fate, have been my go-to Covid consolation. But I see that Serf is available on YouTube – so why not? At least it’s not a compassion-filled unpicking of sexual politics.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"unions urge ministers consider making face masks compulsory","story":"A fresh row broke out over face masks on Sunday night as teaching unions urged ministers to consider making them mandatory for children in all secondary schools.It came as at least 10 schools decided to break with official Government guidance in order to make face coverings compulsory or strongly encouraged when pupils return in September.Unions said recent announcements requiring the wearing of masks on public transport and in shops had highlighted the need for similar protections to be in place in schools and colleges.Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers\u0027 union, said: The Government\u0027s guidance for schools is now out of step with wider public health guidance and guidance to other employers where it is recognised that, where physical distancing cannot be assured, face masks should be worn.Teachers and other staff working in schools also want to be assured that, when they return to the workplace in September, they will be afforded the same level of protection as other workers, and that the guidance for schools will be brought into line with guidance for other workplaces.Mr Roach noted that Government advice means children over the age of 11 are required to wear coverings when they visit a range of facilities such as shops and banks. He said: So there is a strong argument that face masks should also be made compulsory for children when they return to secondary schools in September.At least 10 schools look set to flout guidance in September, with one comprehensive, Holmes Chapel, in Cheshire, including masks in its new school uniform and directing parents to a designated shop where they can be bought for £3.Fallibroome Academy, in Macclesfield, said it expected students to wear masks in corridors, and Brighton College has told parents the current expectation is that masks would be required when pupils move around the site.Meanwhile, the GMB union has written to Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, urging him to adjust the double standards in the Government guidance on face masks.National officer Karen Leonard said it was plain common sense that teachers and other workers in schools should be able to wear coverings.She said: Changing the rules for buses and shops to enforce the wearing of masks while actively discouraging those working in schools from even wearing them is causing untold confusion.Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said she expected most schools to follow the guidance but conceded that there is a fair degree of confusion among the public about why face coverings are required in some settings but not in schools.Masks were made a requirement on public transport last month and became mandatory in shops, takeaways and banks on Friday.Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said last week: We\u0027re not recommending masks for schools because if you\u0027re in a classroom with kids all day then a mask doesn\u0027t give you protection.Meanwhile, a new report from the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change argued that people should be ordered to wear face masks in all public environments and called for teachers to be supplied with plastic face shields.A Department for Education spokesperson said: We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children from September. This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Today we are taking one more step on the road towards giving women a voice and eradicating these harmful practices,” the future prime minister pledged.The unit has been funded through the Department for Education’s children’s social care innovation programme.Since 2015, it has supported more than 1,000 survivors or potential victims of FGM and secured 41 applications for protection orders, which can force the surrender of passports or other travel documents.Around 18,000 social workers, teachers, police and legal professionals have been trained by the centre. In October 2017, its remit was expanded to include breast flattening and child abuse linked to faith or belief.The closure threat is revealed after evidence of an explosion in cases of forced marriage and honour-based abuse during the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Karma Nirvana, a group training the police, NHS and social services, reported a 200 per cent surge in helpline calls in March and April.A government spokesperson said funding for the centre was “time-limited while we worked on more permanent solution to tackle this terrible practice”.“We have also introduced tough safeguarding laws to compel certain professionals to report if they have encountered cases of FGM in under 18s, provided funding for charities to support victims of FGM and, through our new relationships, health and sex education curriculum, we are teaching pupils about the emotional and physical damage of FGM in an age-appropriate way, as well as teaching that it is a crime,” the spokesperson said.Department for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first day of Eid al-Adha marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.Due to Islam traditionally using the lunar calendar the date does sht and its not officially on until theres a clear enough sky showing the crescent of a new moon.This means that there is also a day-long iation between countries depending on where they are in the world.In the UK Eid al-Adha  will begin on the evening of Thursday, July , and end on the evening of Monday, August .Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.As the name would suggest, over the weekend there is usually the sacrice of a sheep, goat, camel or cow. The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid al-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savoury. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so the less fortunate are also able to celebrate.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year in late May, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings. Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up at the end of July and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess. Finding all the mixtapes I made for girlfriends who’d just left me, and reliving the sadness to the accompaniment of Phil Collins.DAVID BECKHAM wishes to build a pond in his back garden, which is good news for insects, birds and wildle in general, but apparently it’s not such good news for his neighbours, who say there are already too many ponds in the area so another is not neededToo many ponds  I think what they meant to say is: “We are bitter and so twisted with jealousy that we want to make Mr Beckham’s le as miserable as ours have turned out to be.”OVER the past few years, cigarette sales in Britain have plummeted by million a month.Experts are struggling to understand why there has been such a massive fall and why it happened so quickly.Some say the health warnings are being effective.

The salvo showed they were determined to break with centuries of protocol to do things their way.It set the couple on a collision course with courtiers and senior royals.

He has been a brilliant father to those boys.He welcomed Meghan and her mother, Doria, into the family, inviting them for tea at Clarence House, and then of course stepping in to walk Meghan down the aisle.The timing and contents of this book will not go down well. Charles, like the Queen, never complains. He didn’t say a word after his orce from Diana, he just got on with working hard for the country.He will be concerned about the UK. In the biggest crisis we’ve faced since World War Two, Harry is thousands of miles away moaning.“If he was willing to confront those close to him, when it came to the media, Harry was poised for an outright war.”The book, Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, insists Charles did not mind the impact on his tour.

The proposals include a ban on TV and online adverts until after the pm watershed and an end to buy-one-get-one-free promotions on unhealthy foods. Cafe, takeaway or restaurant chains with more than  staff will be ordered to publish calorie counts on menus while alcoholic drinks will have to display hidden aposliquid caloriesapos.GPs will be encouraged to prescribe cycling as a way for patients to lose weight amid growing evidence that excess weight is associated with a higher risks from coronavirus.The new Better Health campaign will provide advice to around  million Brits, including setting out a -week diet plan to help them lose weight. The plan comes as evidence mounts on the link between excess weight and a higher risk of severe illness from coronavirus. A Public Health Englandstudy published at the weekend discovered that being classed as medically obese increased the risk of death from coronavirus by %. Almost two thirdsof adults in England are overweight or living with obesity, with obesity-related illnesses costing the NHS £ billion a year. A worrying one in three children leave primary school overweight or obese.The highly-interventionist approach marks a major u-turn from Boris Johnson, who until recently has been a vocal opponent of sin taxes and nanny state interventions on public health. The PM, who has lost a stone and a bit in his own brush with the deadly disease, said: “Losing weight is hard but with some small changes we can all feel fitter and healthier. If we all do our bit, we can reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus – as well as taking pressure off the NHS.” Research shows that many adults are consuming - extra calories a day above recommended guidelines, with overweight children consuming up to  calories more than needed. The Government plans to consult on whether the junk food ban on online adverts should apply at all times of day. New laws will restrict the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar, such as ‘buy one get one free’ offers - and they will be banned from checkouts and shop entrances. Shops will be encouraged to offer more discounts on healthier food like fruit and vegetables. A second consultation will look at plans to provide calorie labelling on alcohol, which is estimated to account for nearly % of the calorie intake of those who drink.

This is a Block, Block, Block government – not the Build, Build, Build fantasy of the Prime Minister’s fevered imagination. The Conservatives are the Nimby Party, defenders of the socially unaware possessors, the I’m Alright Jacks and Janes – a political vehicle for haves who hate the have-nots obstructing their views.  Twiddling planning regs is a smokescreen to obscure wider self-interest and a lack of public investment to power Britain to prosperity for all. The Prime Minister’s purported New Deal, all £billion ly hailed as an infrastructure bonanza that turned out to be regurgitated rather than new money, is as all words and no deeds. Disastrously mishandling coronavirus, a world-beating failure in terms of fatality counts and economic impact, is a symptom of a more ­fundamental sickness.

Yet the virus hides the gulf in many other areas, between speeches and press releases and reality on the ground.

Social media companies have had repeated opportunities to show they can police their sites effectively. But when high profile iniduals are allowed to keep their s after spreading vile anti-Semitic abuse - and then doubling down when challenged - it’s clear that self-regulation isn’t working.

Here, in his own words, he shares his story... Have you ever sat on the bus and seen someone making a strange noise  Perhaps you moved away, feeling uncomfortable. Well, that person was possibly someone like me. I have Tourette’s Syndrome . Which means sometimes I make weird noises and twitch. Sometimes this freaks people out. You might assume all people with Tourette’s shout out swear words. But actually coprolalia – as it’s known – affects only % of us. I like to swear as much as the next Yorkshireman, but I don’t do it uncontrollably as part of my Tourette’s. There are many misconceptions about this neurological condition. My tics began when I was seven. I would snf loudly or let out a kind of ‘whooping’ noise. With little awareness on the topic, my parents had no clue what it could be. It took a primary school teacher to gently suggest I might have Tourette’s after watching a documentary. My mum, Annette, did her research after that, and within a few weeks we travelled from our home in Bradford to London’s Great Ormond Street, where the hospital confirmed the diagnosis. There is no cure for Tourette’s, but treatment can help manage symptoms. I was put on medication to help calm the tics. It didn’t work, but it made me pile on the pounds. So now I had my weight as well as tics to feel self-conscious about. I had no real understanding of what was happening, but that year I wrote to Father Christmas begging him to make me ‘normal’. People often ask what the tics feel like. Sometimes they are conscious, sometimes they aren’t. For the ones that are, it’s like an urge to scratch a bad mosquito bite – the more you resist the itch, the bigger it becomes. But when you finally scratch, after a moment of relief, the sensation s.  A tic can be anything from a noise, twitch or cough, to rapid head movements, finger clicks, deep breaths and whistles. It gets worse when you’re stressed, sick, nervous or excited, and everyone’s dferent. In public, during a bad day, it’s often mortying. I remember one of the visits to London when I was eight. Feeling excited about the train, the tics were prominent. I let out some ‘whoops’ and a man in the carriage shouted, ‘Will someone please shut that child up!’ My mum was furious on my behalf, but I felt such shame. It’s for this reason so many kids with Tourette’s shut themselves away. I was bullied, with name calling including ‘spastic’, ‘retard’ and ‘abortion’. Kids can be a***holes, and sometimes the teachers were unwittingly as bad. I got sent out of class when my vocal tics were aggravated. Standing in the hallway felt like a punishment for something I couldn’t help. And there was the supply teacher who yelled, ‘What on earth is wrong with you, boy ’ in front of the whole class. Even when people tried to be kind, hurtful situations arose. When our neighbours held a birthday party for their son, I’d been allowed early access on the bouncy castle. But when the guests arrived I was told it was ‘just for adults’ now and sent home. The next few hours were spent in my bedroom, tears rolling, as I listened to kids bouncing with glee. They were embarrassed about the twitching kid who makes noises. I hated being dferent.  So many kids with TS are full of self-loathing. I feel it’s my duty to help educate the next generation. There needs to be more compassion and understanding, so children aren’t scared and so judged. And while this may seem like a sorrowful tale, it’s actually not. Thankfully, le slowly improved. At senior school, aged , I had asked the headmaster to announce in assembly I had TS and explain what it was. This actually helped kids and staff become more tolerant. I learned an important lesson in facing problems head-on. While I wasn’t popular, I did have some friends. I was around  when I realised that channelling my energy into my passions – writing, drama, entrepreneurial projects – saw my tics begin to slow down and even disappear in some cases. These became coping mechanisms, greatly reducing the urges to tic. Truth is, people with Tourette’s have a superpower that, when channelled into something they love, makes them unstoppable. Intertwine this with ious cognitive behavioural therapies , such as meditation and positive mental attitude techniques, and it sets us a world apart. At  I landed a place at Lancaster University, studying marketing management, which I loved. I also ‘came out’. I’d had crushes on boys since I was , so this was a massive relief.  I first became interested in wine when, during my course, I spent a year in San Francisco. I met an amazing couple who became like family to me, Steve and Rose Smith. I’d often shadow them on weekends at their winery, and their love for wine completely rubbed off on me – the senses, the smells, the tasting profiles. I was hooked, and it kick-started my career in the wine industry. I now write a wine and spirits column, and through this world met my incredible friends Helena Nicklin and Colin Hampden-White. Together, we created an award-winning TV series on Amazon Prime called The Three Drinkers. You might wonder how the hell a person with Tourette’s ended up as a TV presenter  Interestingly, when the cameras roll, I’m so focused on doing what I love, my tics go away and viewers have no idea. Tourette’s doesn’t just ‘disappear’, of course. It’s with us forever, although statistically it calms down with age. Confidence issues can greatly affect people with TS. Take dating. ‘Will anyone ever fall in love with me ’ is a concern that worries many of us. On a first date my tics can go unnoticed, some of us learn to mask them. But by the time someone comes over for dinner they get more obvious. People ask, ‘Have you got hiccups ’ and you have to work out when best to tell them. I don’t exactly want to pull out the TS leaflets over the second bottle of wine. I’m still navigating this. My le will never be ‘normal’, and I’ll continue getting odd looks. But I’m happy and successful. These days I see having Tourette’s not as my weakness, but my biggest strength.  Touretteaposs – the facts WHAT IS TOURETTE’S  A neurological condition characterised by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalisations called tics.

Now, when I hear a new dog is coming into my le I can barely sleep. I am so excited. What will they look like  How will their personality be  What challenges will I need to help them overcome  I’ve always been a dog lover, but was never allowed one when I was growing up in Essex. Then in my late teens, I met a guy who did not like dogs – our relationship lasted  years, so getting a four-legged friend had not been an option. When he and I eventually split in , he moved out of our Gloucestershire cottage, and I thought, ‘Sod it! I’ve only myself to please now.’  It was back in September, soon after the break-up, when I contacted the Dogs Trust and applied to be a foster carer. As a single woman I couldn’t afford to buy a dog, and the beauty of volunteering to foster means that the charity covers the cost of food and anything  you need to buy for the dog while in your care, including any vet bills. Interview stage There were interviews, home visits and paperwork – I passed all the requirements. As a gardener, I can take a dog with me to work most days, so it wouldn’t be left alone, plus I have a garden and live near the Forest of Dean, perfect for walking. And I don’t have children or any other pets to worry about, so I was seen as a good option. From a selfish point of view, I was looking forward to sharing my empty home with someone  again. Another warm body on the sofa next to me.  It was in March, just as coronavirus was sweeping the nation, when Dogs Trust Evesham rang. They had a nine-month-old Collie cross-breed who’d been rescued from dire conditions where  dogs had been kept in a barn. Could I take her in until they found her a permanent home  Melted my heart Well, they brought Athena to my garden and my heart just melted at the first sight of her pretty face. She wasn’t used to human contact, so I didn’t make a huge fuss. I let her snf around my garden as I drank a cup of tea, just watching her. By that first evening she was laying her head in my lap. I had to toilet train her, which involved heaps of praise when she went outside. If she had accidents inside I never told her off, I just quickly cleaned it up. I got through plenty of cleaning products, but after a week she’d got the hang of it. As I busily worked in clients’ gardens, I listened to audiobooks on dog behaviours and training to educate myself. Athena stayed for three and a half weeks before it was time for her to leave to be with her permanent owner. I cried when she left, but felt so happy that I’d been able to help her. Being toilet trained makes a dog far more appealing to adoptees.  Aries came next, a two-year-old cross-breed. He hated the noise of the bin men, all the crashing around and the flashing lights, but quickly learned to walk on the lead. I began chatting to new people on our walks. Having a dog gave my le structure, some company, and – I know this sounds silly – but I felt myself healing after the split, I got healthier and stronger. I would have felt so isolated in lockdown otherwise. How long you have a dog totally depends on how soon they are re-homed, so it can be anything from a few days to several weeks. Joy and fulfilment I really fell in love with Hermes, my next dog. He was also from the same barn, and terried of everything. He freaked out indoors and would scrabble to escape out of a window, then whimper. I would stand outside and keep an eye on him from the window, gradually building up the time he could be left. It was a complete buzz seeing his behaviour change. It was hard kissing Hermes goodbye, he’d become my buddy, but I know my time with him had changed his le prospects. My fourth dog was an adorable, problem-free Maltese puppy, Bea. I’ve never had one try to bite me. The most damage they’ve caused is chewing a wooden coffee table leg, but I am not precious about these things.  I’m having a few days away now, but I can’t wait to welcome a new dog into my le when I’m back. I bumped into my ex the other day and he remarked how happy I seemed now. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll be out walking and meet someone new  But I’m happy being single now, the dogs have brought me more joy and fulfilment than I thought possible. What is dog fostering  ● The Home From Home fostering scheme finds temporary homes for dogs that need a little extra TLC, such as young puppies, older dogs and those who would find the hustle and bustle of kennels stressful. ● Fostering is completely voluntary, and Dogs Trust provides essentials, such as food and bedding, and provides -hour guidance and training advice. ● Adam Clowes, Dogs Trust operations director, says: ‘Being a foster carer gives you all the joy of adopting without the long-term commitment. It’s perfect for dog lovers who aren’t ready to adopt yet. aposJust as importantly, becoming a foster carer means helping fellow dog lovers who have no other choice than to permanently give up their dog. You’ll be giving a dog a loving home when they need it most. Every dog in foster care allows us to take in another dog in need.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"harry meghan felt snubbed royal","story":"NewsHow the Queens Christmas speech left Harry and Meghan feeling snubbedAccording to new book Finding Freedom, Prince Harry and Meghan were dismayed when photos of them and their son Archie were absent during the Queens Christmas Day speech in ShareCommentsBySam Truelove:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsPhotos of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and their son Archie were absent as the Queen recorded the Christmas Speech last year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

According to Finding Freedom, the couple were dismayed when no picture of them and their son Archie was visible on the desk in the Green Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace, where the Queen records her annual speech. In , Harry and Meghan appeared in a photo with William and Kate as the Queen read her Christmas message. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write that Harry and Meghan felt they had long been sidelined by the institution and were not a fundamental part of its future. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. According to palace sources quoted in the book, the Royal Family wanted to illustrate the line of succession. Harry and Meghan were not completely disregarded in the Christmas Day speech, however. Footage of the Queen and Prince Philip meeting Archie for the first time was included, with footage showing Harry, Meghan and Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, watching on. I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great-grandchild, the Queen said at the time.  In the Queenaposs  Christmas Day speech, Her Majesty can be seen sitting in the Green Drawing Room of the palace beside a table with framed pictures. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall appear in a photo which marked the th anniversary of his investiture as Prince of Wales. A lovely family portrait of William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis stands in the middle. Thereaposs also a photograph of King George VI from  as well as one of the Duke of Edinburgh from the Queenaposs private collection. But notably, Harry, Meghan and their son Archie are no where to be seen. Royal commentator Ingrid Seward said at the time it was unlikely the Queen’s photo selections represented a deliberate snub to Harry and Meghan. But she said: “It does seem to represent the idea of a slimmed-down monarchy.” Ms Seward added: “All the media problems with Harry and Meghan must have worried her. However, she would never be so underhand as to deliberately omit their picture.” Prince Andrew, forced to quit royal duties over his aposcar crashapos Newsnight interview over his ­friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was also absent from the photos.As the Queenaposs Christmas Day speech was aired to millions across the world, Meghan and Harry were spending the Christmas break in Canada with their young son."},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds revellers ignore coronavirus restrictions","story":"NewsHundreds of revellers ignore coronavirus restrictions to party in the streetNeighbours in Cheylesmore, Coventry, claim that up to  people partied at the illegal street event where some smoked cannabis while they enjoyed loud rap musicShareCommentsByJosh LaytonLorraine King:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video coronavirus-uk-confirmed-deaths--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

But his younger brother allegedly took offence to the phrase this girl, and interpreted it as snobbish and condescending. aposRt stemmed from coolness between princesapos  According to the co-authors, the alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William - and not Meghan and Kate. The press were apparently too quick to blame the Sussexesapos decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses, the authors say, when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. Meghan and Kate aposwere not at warapos As it became clear there were problems between the Cambridges and Sussexes, some press reports claimed Meghan and Kate were at odds or even disliked each other. But the biography claims the pair were not at war, but did have their awkward moments and never became close because they had nothing in common. It alleges the Duchess of Cambridge apparently did little to bridge the ide between William and Harry, and never really got to know Meghan. The authors claim Meghan and Kate didnapost spend much time together before the Sussexes got married in May  and they didnapost get any closer afterwards. aposAwkward momentsapos between duchesses  There were some awkward moments between the royal wives, but the duo never had a falling out. It is claimed Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The book says: Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadnapost progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. But they were not at war with each other, either. There were awkward moments, such as the day the women happened to cross paths at Kensington Palace , and although both were heading out to go shopping - in the same street - Kate went in her own Range Rover. Meghan didnapost make Kate cry, book claims Rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaidaposs dress fitting for Princess Charlotte are , the book insists. Reports that Meghanaposs strict demands had left Kate in tears puzzled those who were present. A source who was there claimed: Some of the children werenapost co-operating, and there was a lot going on. Everyone tried to help where they could, but itaposs never easy with kids at fittings. There were no tears from anyone. And in the end, the fitting was fine. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room, and there were other people there. Harryaposs aposshowgirlapos  Finding Freedom claims some senior royals, courtiers and aides had ious names for Meghan behind her back. One senior royal allegedly referred to the duchess as Harryaposs showgirl - and another said she comes with a lot of baggage. Another senior courtier is said to have told a colleague: Thereaposs just something about her I donapost trust. Sussexes aposfelt snubbedapos by Queen Harry and Meghan are said to have felt snubbed when the Queen delivered her Christmas Day speech last year and they didnapost see photos of their family next to her. The absence of their photo was yet another sign that they needed to consider their own path, the book says. However, the Queen mentioned Archieaposs birth in her speech and the broadcast showed footage of her and Prince Philip meeting their eighth great-grandchild for the first time. Meghan felt sorry for her dad - and then let down The Duchess of Sussex felt sorry for her estranged father Thomas, wanted him at her wedding and blamed the media for corrupting him, according to the book. She felt let down when Mr Markle lied to her by denying he helped the paparazzi stage photos of him going about his le in a Mexican resort town before his daughteraposs wedding. But both Meghan and Harry were also angry at the media for allegedly wearing down Mr Markle for several months until he complied with their requests. According to an unnamed trusted confidant of the duchess, Meghan had said: My dad never sought this out. I really believe that heaposs the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe heaposs been fully corrupted. Meghanaposs dad and half-sister apossplit cash from staged photosapos The book says after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in November, , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials of: I canapost speak out of respect for my family. Meghan and Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately - with encouragement from Meghanaposs elder half-sister Samantha - Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, the book says. Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photos, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The photos were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning £,, and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing % of the proceeds, according to the book. A week before the May  royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday tabloid was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged. Meghan called dad to find out truth  The book says palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as Meghan phoned her father. Dad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running -you are telling me itaposs fake, she reportedly told him. If they do that, theyaposre going out of their way to protect you, Dad. Youaposre telling me youaposre being victimised, right  Mr Markle had replied Of course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day. Duchess still wanted her dad at wedding Despite his deception, Meghan had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media. As much as she was hurt and humiliated, she wanted him to be there and was willing to move on, an unidentied friend of Meghanaposs is quoted as saying. Plus, she was worried about him she honestly wasnapost surehe was actually OK. His behaviour was bizarre. Thomas ignored Meghanaposs last text before wedding  The book gives further glimpses of Meghanaposs troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding. She allegedly left or sent dozens of messages telling him a car would take him to Los Angeles airport so he could fly to London. He was expected to walk her down the aisle. After he had told her he wouldnapost be there to watch her get married, the biography claims, a heartbroken Meghan sent her dad one final text message the night before her wedding. However, he didnapost respond. The book claims: “If it wasn’t for Harry, Doria and her friends, Meghan herself says that she wouldn’t have mentally got through it [the wedding]. “The night before the wedding, she sent her father one last text. He did not reply,” the book says. “Sitting in a bath later that night, FaceTiming with a friend, the bride-to-be said she had left her dad a final message, adding: ‘I can’t sit up all night just pressing send’.” The beginning of the rt "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan knew harry the one","story":"NewsMeghan Markle knew Harry was the one after  dates - but he said I love you firstAccording to friends quoted in biography Finding Freedom, Harry and Meghan were immediately obsessed with one another after their first date at Dean Street Townhouse in Londons SohoShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsMeghan and Harry chat at the Invictus Games in Toronto\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The next day they flew to Johannesburg and then onto a safari in Botswana. A friend said: She came back smiling and just completely spellbound. Just three months into their relationship Harry told Meghan that he loved her. Thankfully for the bowled over monarch Meghan immediately ed the compliment.

Meghan is said to have thought some of the stories about her were down to her sex and because she has a black mum. Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, claim a friend said that she was seen as ‘Duchess Dferent’ and because she stood out she was not liked by some. The controversial book is serialised by the Sunday Times. The friend said: It was open season on Meghan, with many looking for anything and everything to criticise ‘“Duchess Dferent. “That’s what people have a problem with. She’s the easiest person in the world to work with. Certain people just don’t like the fact she stands out.”’ Meghan, a former actress, is claimed to have a solid work ethic which includes waking at am each morning and talking to her key aides about how to shape her new role in the royal family. However shortly after Harry and Meghan’s marriage in May  rumours emerged that she was wasting no time in putting her aposstampapos on her new role and those around her. The book claims this led to her decisive and assertive nature being seen negatively. The authors wrote: Meghan felt as though some of the commentary and tabloid stories were more than a culture clash they were sexist and prejudiced. If a man got up before dawn to work, he was applauded for his work ethic. If a woman did it, she was deemed dficult or “a bitch”. The double standard was exacerbated when it came to successful women of colour, often labelled demanding or aggressive.’ The authors said in the book that while racism ‘takes a dferent form in the UK from in America’, it remains ‘ingrained’ here. Mr Scobie, a royal journalist who has a Scottish dad and an Iranian mum, reportedly left his first job at Heat magazine after he was racially abused by an executive.It is claimed that a worker at Buckingham Palace once said he was ‘surprised’ to hear Mr Scobie, was was privately educated, speak so well. In their book, Mr Scobie and Ms Durand say: Racism takes a dferent form in the UK from in America, but there is no mistaking its existence and how ingrained it is. A major theme of racism in the UK centres on the question of who is authentically “British”.

The gesture came amid mounting speculation that the women had become the “duelling duchesses” as relations between them were so frosty.While palace aides briefed royal reporters that Prince Harry ’s we Meghan and Prince William’s we Kate were in contact by phone and text, they were unable to disguise the fact that they were far from close.Kate’s attempt to build bridges, reported in Vanity Fair, was not mentioned in Finding Freedom, the book about the royals by Meghan’s pal Omid Scobie, and Carolyn Durand. It does say that Meghan got flowers from Kate for her birthday. But it adds: “Flowers for her birthday were nice, but Meghan would far rather have had Kate check in on her during the most dficult times.” Friends of Kate and William have hit out at the book, describing claims the Cambridges snubbed Meghan as “plain wrong”. The book says: “Meghan was disappointed that she and Kate hadn’t bonded over the position they shared, but she wasn’t losing sleep over it. According to a source, Kate felt they didn’t have much in common ‘other than the fact that they lived at Kensington Palace’.” The book also claims Prince Harry, , was “p***ed off” when his “snobby” brother William, , cautioned him not to rush into marrying “that girl”. Pals say the Cambridges had “done all they possibly could” to welcome actress Meghan, , into the royal fold.  They insist the couple “rolled out the red carpet” and “welcomed Meghan with open arms”. Meghan was invited to Anmer Hall, the Cambridges’ family home in Norfolk, where Kate, , cooked vegan meals for Harry’s then-fiancee. They also hosted Meghan’s bridal party before her wedding in May , and Kate asked her to join her in the Royal Box at Wimbledon for two successive years. A friend told a Sunday newspaper: “It’s just completely wrong to suggest they didn’t talk and plain wrong to say the Cambridges weren’t welcoming. “How can you say they weren’t warm or welcoming when they hosted Meghan for Christmas, invited her into their totally private inner sanctum at Anmer Hall and did everything they could to make her feel at home  They personally cooked her favourite vegan food, they couldn’t have been more welcoming.”  Scobie and Durand claim in the book that Meghan was subjected to several snubs by Kate. They recall an awkward moment when they crossed paths at Kensington Palace, heading out to the same street to shop. Kate jumped into her Range Rover and left Meghan to go shopping alone. The book also accuses Kate of ignoring her sister-in-law at Meghan and Harry’s farewell as senior royals. The book claims the couples hardly spoke at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey this March. Harry and Meghan had walked ahead of the main royal party, including William and Kate, after being removed from the prime line-up. A friend of Harry and Meghan said: “It felt intentional. Harry was more than disappointed. He spoke up, but the damage had already been done.”  In an interview, Scobie said that during the service, “Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, but the Duchess barely acknowledged her. To purposefully snub your sister-in-law. I don’t think it left a great taste.” During a polo match in July , Meghan and Kate were described as having a “cordial but distant rapport”. It was the first time the Cambridges and Sussexes had been seen together as families since the birth of Harry and Meghan’s son Archie that May. The book says: “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word. “The truth was Meghan and Kate just didn’t know each other that well.” Scobie, described as a “Meghan apostle”, and Durand dismiss rumours that Meghan made Kate cry during a bridesmaid’s dress fitting for Princess Charlotte. A source who was allegedly at the fitting said: “Some of the ­children weren’t co-operating. There were no tears from anyone. Kate and Meghan were both a little stressed but professional in the room.” The book, being serialised in the Times and Sunday Times, also says reports of Meghan shouting at a member of Kate’s team were also untrue. The story allegedly related to Kensington Palace deputy communications secretary Katrina McKeever, who left her post in September .

Rachel Riley is one of the famous faces backing the awards, which will for the first time recognise the amazing work of iniduals from National Lottery-funded projects across the nation.  Rachel says: “Thanks to National Lot­­tery players, some £million has gone to support communities in the crisis. “But this year we want to honour the people within those projects who adapted so quickly and gave extra help. “It’s a real chance to say thank you. The winners in each category will win £, for their organisation and a National Lottery Award trophy.” Nominations are open- and the stories of some of the heroes already put forward showcase the commitment and sacrice so many people have been making during these troubled times.  Take actress and theatre director Moji Elufowoju, the founder of Sheffield-based Utopia Theatre Company. She has just been nominated for a National Lottery Award, thanks to the incredible Creative Hub initiative she has been running during lockdown. Now , Moji swapped a career as a paralegal to study drama in her forties before founding Utopia Theatre in . And as a British-born, Nigerian-raised performer, Moji says she had to battle discrimination in an industry where ethnic minorities have struggled for opportunities. She broke through after “continually banging my head against a brick wall and refusing to take no for an answer”. She is now determined to inspire a new generation of black artists.  “There’s a white middle-class club in British theatre and it can make the industry inaccessible to others – whether that’s performing, playwriting or simply being in the audience,” says Moji. “You can feel invisible, and I know a lot of black creatives with mental health issues as a result. “Utopia Theatre is all about giving erse people a voice.

But the timing of his youngest sonaposs statement, in which Harry accused the media of racial undertones at the same time as confirming his new relationship, meant it dominated the news cycle. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand also claim Harry, , gave his dad just  minutes notice before releasing the statement in November . At the time, Charles was rounding off a delicate tour in the Persian Gulf sovereign state which he hoped would be covered signicantly. Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family: It was a critical moment that had been in the works for months. A statement from Kensington Palace condemning the Press and, in the same breath, confirming Harry’s new girlfriend would all but eliminate coverage of Prince Charles’s tour of the Gulf. Royal authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim: “The team at Clarence House, which had spent months putting together Prince Charles’ tour in the hopes that it would be covered signicantly, was crushed.” The book goes on to say Harry was lashing out at anyone who questioned his new relationship. “He would wonder, ‘Is this about race  Is it snobbery ’ the authors wrote.  Harry had allegedly cut ties with a friend for gossiping about Meghan and was poised for an outright war with the media. However, the book insists Charles understood that the situation with Meghan had reached a tipping point despite being disappointed by the timing of his sonaposs statement. Other extracts from the book - to be released August  - claim Harry felt brother William behaved like a snob as his new romance blossomed.  The authors says the protective older brother told the Duke of Sussex not to rush the relationship in a heart-to-heart nine months after he began dating US actress Meghan. He is said to have told his brother: Donapost feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl. Harry was reportedly left fuming by Williamaposs choice of words, and the pair hardly spoke for months afterwards.

And yet food is now one of the most popular things to post about online. In some respects this isn’t surprising because merely seeing beautul pictures of food can make us salivate. However, we’re now taking so many pictures of food that you can buy cameras with a specic food mode – and this is just one way that social media has transformed the way we eat. Le Online: The Impact Social media has had a signicant impact on how we eat. It’s changed what we choose to eat, how we eat and why we choose the foods we do. It has contributed to more and more extreme ideas about food, led to an explosion of misinformation, provided an easy  for us to judge and shame one another and added extra pressure to be perfect. But social media has also opened up new avenues for recipe inspiration, sharing of health expertise and food communities. The truth is, modern technology has affected our food in both positive and negative ways. It can make us feel dissatisfied or enrich our lives. Snap happy Insta-diet There are many reasons we take and share pictures of food. Making something ourselves is a source of pride, or we want to record an event or social occasion. Maybe it’s a special treat we want to remember or perhaps the food is beautul, unusual or dferent.  Often it’s because we want to track what we’re eating – apparently % of Instagram users photograph their food for a photoblog or as a food diary. There are few things that can bring people closer together the same way as sharing a meal does – eventhat sharing experience happens via a screen rather than across a table. We’ve always eaten with our eyes first and social media is an amplication of this. It’s exciting, whether it’s taking a bit of extra care when plating up a dish or when you’ve finally ordered a menu item that all your online friends are raving about. It adds to the whole experience of eating. When we share food on social media, we invite other people to participate in our experience. By posting about our food on social media, we never truly eat alone. The comparison trap Of course, the online world of food isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Sharing pictures of your food invites assumptions, judgments and shaming.  And following food accounts invites comparison. This can often lead to food anxiety. Most people who walk through the door to my clinic come because they have a relationship with food that is riddled with fear, shame and anxiety. They have been exposed to a signicant amount of misinformation – usually online – and they’re tired of feeling stressed about everything they’re eating. The rise of influencers Influencers do exactly that – they use their online presence to influence the buying, eating or exercise habits of their followers. It’s known that anecdotes are more appealing and memorable than statistics which is why personal stories about food and health are very common on social media. One of the reasons we share food pictures online is for status. We’re far more likely to post a food picture from an expensive Michelin-starred restaurant or an exclusive food event, than we are from the local pub.  These pictures make our lives look exciting and desirable. When these beautul foods are shared and go viral, the restaurants or locations that sell them become go-to destinations, to the point where there are queues out the door. We suffer from serious FOMOwhen our social media feed is full of things we haven’t tried yet. But don’t forget that what you see on an influencer’s feed isn’t always the whole truth – some restaurants collaborate with them, giving them free meals and products in exchange for promotion and exposure. Look vs taste The rise of influencers and social media has encouraged restaurants to make food that’s aesthetically pleasing and gets the likes, but doesn’t always satisfy the palate. When a certain dish becomes an Instagram sensation, it results in people queuing down the street. Starbucks’ Unicorn Frappuccino is a classic example of something looking good without actually tasting good.  I haven’t met a single person who has tried it and wasn’t disappointed by the flavour. That didn’t stop people from sharing their pictures online though. In the end, what these viral foods lack in flavour, they make up for in likes and comments. Camera backlash While many chefs and restaurants love it when customers take pictures and share them online, others are less keen. High-end chefs such as David Chang at Michelin-starred Ko in New York have banned diners from taking photos of food, while The Fat Duck in Berkshire, owned by Heston Blumenthal, has a no-flash policy. A group of French chefs, including one with the coveted three Michelin stars, has threatened to ban cameras and mobile phones from their restaurants entirely.

The maps were kept by Royal Naval Lieutenant James Main, who was a navigating officer on HMS Fraserburgh, the leading ship of the minesweeping flotilla on June , . Lt Main, along with hundreds of comrades, helped clear the English Channel and the sea around Normandy of mines to enable the Allied forces to safely advance to the beaches. His ship occupied a position off Ouistreham on Sword Beach during Operation Neptune. His wartime possessions include the top secret navigation maps he would have used to help plot the route to Sword Beach. His archive also includes a wrecked German flag he recovered from off the beach after it had been taken by the Allies, and an Australian one which was lying on the sand. The archive is expected to fetch £, when it goes under the hammer with London-based Chiswick Auctions. One map, issued on May , , lists all naval headquarters and instructions on communications protocols. Another chart, headed ‘swept channels and routing situation D-Day’, shows routes from the English Channel to each landing beach. His other possessions in the sale are his leather scabbard, hat, belt, identity card and navigation instruments.Lt Main, a Distinguished Service Cross recipient, was born in Newcastle in  and enlisted with the Navy in , carrying on his service post-war. Valentina Borghi, specialist at Chiswick Auctions, said: “It is very rare to find top secret D-Day material and we expect interest from museums and institutions. “There are photos of Lt Main and also of coastal positions which aided the important landings as he cleared mines to clear the course to Sword beach, with his task beginning on June .“He was navigating officer on board HMS Fraserburgh, the leading ship of the minesweeping flotilla on D-Day. “Unfortunately not a lot is known about his post-war le but we believe he remained in the navy for a time. “The archive has been put together by a private collector.”Sword Beach, the most eastern of the five landing areas, was assaulted by the British rd Division, with French and British commandos attached. The initial landings were achieved with few casualties, but the advance from the beach was slowed by German resistance on the heavily defended beach head.

She started to suffer from bouts of sickness, dizziness and had a suspected lazy eye. Her mum Kelly Morris assumed the youngster was struggling with the government imposed restrictions. The -year-old took her for a check-up at her local Specsavers on June  as she had become increasingly worried. Less than  hours later Hollie was on the operating table at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital having a benign brain tumour removed. Primary school support worker Kelly, who is also mum to -year-old Charlie, said she was shocked. “Hollie wasn’t acting herself at all,” she said. “She didn’t want to get dressed, she’d stay in bed all day and was totally detached – but I genuinely put it down to lockdown anxiety. “If it wasn’t for that eye test, who knows where we’d be  The doctor told meit had been even a few days longer, she might not be with us now.” She continued: “As soon as medics askedthere’d be any changes in Hollie’s behaviour, it all made sense. It wasn’t lockdown – it was a tumour pushing down on the back of her brain.” Hollie, who was previously fit and healthy, began acting strangely shortly after lockdown began. “She would refuse to get out of bed, which wasn’t like her at all,” Kelly said. “Hollie is usually such a happy young girl, but instead she was moping round the house and not wanting to engage with anyone. “We always used to go on walks together and suddenly she was refusing to do anything. “She always thrived off seeing her friends and instead she would cry her eyes out at the prospect of being away from me – it wasn’t like her at all.” By the end of May, Hollie had developed some other symptoms. “Hollie starting suffering with headaches, but it was nearly summer by then and so I put it down to her hay fever, which in the past had seen her full of headaches and sneezes,” Kelly added.“Then, there was a week where she was being sick three or four times every morning.“A few of my friends had posted on Facebook about a sick bug going around, so I chalked it up to that.”As lockdown measures were eased Kelly had a catch up with her parents, delivery driver Mark, , and food packager Kath, , in her front garden. They spotted something unusual about their granddaughter. Kelly explained: “We were in the front garden when my mum noticed something wasn’t quite right with Hollie’s left eye. “It was turning inwards – almost like a lazy eye. “I hadn’t noticed it before, but after Mum pointed it out, it was hard to miss.”  Over the next couple of days, Hollie also started experiencing dizzy spells and was struggling to keep her balance. “It was asshe was drunk,” Kelly said. “She was seeing double and her left eye was moving more and more inwards. “It got to the point where I knew we had to get it checked out.” Kelly booked an appointment for Hollie at their local Specsavers. The youngster had previously been told she had perfect eyesight during her last check-up in November . When the optician examined photos taken of the back of Hollie’s eye he found something unusual. “He explained that there was a lot of pressure on the back of her eye and, although it wasn’t his place to make a diagnosis, it was clearly something quite serious,” Kelly said. From there, Kelly was told to expect a call from Leigh Infirmary, where the photographs had been sent for further inspection. Less than three hours later, medics phoned her, urging her to take Hollie straight to Wigan’s Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, who have a larger paediatrics ward.  With grandparents looking after Charlie, Kelly and Hollie arrived at the hospital at pm, where the schoolgirl had a CT scan, which revealed a golf ball sized tumour at the base of her skull. “Words can’t express how it feels getting that news,” said Kelly. “I pretty much broke down on the floor. “When you hear your child has a brain tumour, a million questions run through your mind. How serious is it  Will she be okay  Everything. “But I picked myself up and composed myself before going in to see Hollie. “She was full of smiles and playing with some toys the nurses had got her – a Barbie and some Play-Doh. “I couldn’t bring myself to tell her the diagnosis. The consultant did it for me. He told her she had a lump in her head that was making her poorly. “Hollie reacted pretty well actually, I think she was more upset that I had got upset. I don’t think it really sunk in how serious it was at first.”  Later that evening, Hollie was blue-lighted to Manchester Children’s Hospital, with Kelly staying by her side the entire time. There, medics explained that the tumour needed to be removed as quickly as possible, as it was preventing fluid in the brain to drain properly, causing a dangerous build-up of pressure. Less than  hours after she had walked in to the opticians, Hollie was taken down to theatre for the le-saving operation. Kelly recalled: “I gave her a kiss goodbye and told her I’d see her soon. “We were told that the operation would take around eight hours, so my mum and dad met me, and brought me some dinner. I hadn’t eaten since breakfast the day before.  “They weren’t allowed to come into the hospital because of coronavirus, so we found a nearby bench, off site, to take our minds off what was happening. “After four hours, the consultant called earlier than expected to say they’d taken out the whole tumour and Hollie was being sewn up. We all just sat on the bench crying.” Making a remarkable recovering, Hollie was up and walking around within three days, and was discharged after five. Two days later, a biopsy that had been taken of the tumour after it was removed confirmed that it was benign. Though she does not require any further treatment, Hollie will have MRI scans every three months for the next year to check for regrowth. After that, she will have a scan every six months for a further four years.  But Kelly remains hopeful that her little girl has a bright future ahead. There’s a chance the tumour could come back, but you can’t focus on that,” she said. “Hollie been so brave through this whole ordeal and, thanks to the NHS, we’re in an amazing position to face whatever comes our way. “She’s bounced right back – she’s like she was before lockdown. “The other day she was video calling friends and she let out a real belly laugh – it was music to my ears.

The woman was booted off the American Airlines flight travelling from Ohio to North Carolina on July . Video footage taken by passenger Jordan Slade and shared on social media shows the moment the woman made her way off the plane. After the woman picked up her three bags and started to exit the aircraft, other passengers began to cheer and clap. The woman angrily turned around and shouted: You can clap all you want. A passenger responded by saying: Just leave. We have flights to get. Jesus.  All adult passengers travelling on American Airlines flights are required to wear a face covering due to the coronavirus pandmic.Ms Slade said the woman claimed she wasnapost wearing a mask because of a medical condition.The witness told the Daily Mail: She was argumentative from the gate. She demanded to be boarded first and was causing an obvious scene. Once boarded she was making phone calls and arguing with the attendant when asked to put her phone away. Ms Slade added: She also refused to wear a mask putting others on the flight at risk... Another passenger even got up to confront her about her behavior with no mask. A number of passengers reportedly spoke to flight attendants on the plane to voice concerns that they may miss their connecting flights. The incident took up so much time that after the woman was kicked off the flight the plane had to go back to the airport to refuel.    Ms Slade uploaded the video of passengers clapping and cheering the woman, branded a aposKarenapos, off the flight to Tik Tok, where it has been watched hundreds of thousands of times. Currently, more than , people have liked the video.  Clapping was % necessary, one person commented. Another said: The person beside her was literally wearing a mask and a face shield. If you canapost wear a mask on the plane then just drive wherever you need to go.The video was also shared on Twitter, where a number of users were quick to slam the woman.One said: Why the hell would someone pay for a flight and then forfeit their seat because they’re too stubborn to wear a mask  Why bother buying a ticket  How long was this flight  Surely it couldnapost be more than a few hours  Crazy. Another added: FANTASTIC! She had a choice - wear the mask or get off the plane - she made her choice to be selfish and self centered and not wear a mask for the safety of others on the plane - good riddance!  From July , American Airlines will require all customers over the age of two to wear face coverings on board planes and at airports. The company said passengers must keep their masks on from the time they enter their departure airport to the time they exit their arrival airport, except for while eating or drinking. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention one of the best ways we can slow the spread of Covid- is to wear a face covering, said Alison Taylor, chief customer officer of American Airlines.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed

many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its

Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of

patients had few personal items as family members were unable to visit them, so did not have basic items such as pyjamas and toiletries.She said: ldquoA lot of people were being admitted in emergency situations so they didnrsquot have and were missing essential items, from nightwear to phone chargers.She added that other initiatives aimed to help nurses, whereas this specically helped patients.The mum of two, who studied at Napier University and qualied in , then came up with the idea to get these items to the patients and launched a campaign on a local Facebook group, Edinburgh Gossip Girls, with the original aim of raising pound to create the boxes.To date the total stands at more than pound,, with a further pound, donated from RBS, bringing the total raised to more than pound,.Alison said: ldquoThe pound target was smashed in a few minutes.She now has a small team of people supporting her.She added: ldquoWe have enough money to last until October but hopefully things will be back to normal [by then] and people can come in on visits and the need wonrsquot be as great.Boxes are delivered to all  wards in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, as well as nearby hospices and the East Lothian Community Hospital in Haddington.Her campaign, alongside her job as a nurse and working during the current coronavirus crisis, led to her being nominated in the holiday competition by Rock My World Travel.The competition was featured in Travel Weekly, a travel industry trade magazine, and run by travel company Stuba, in recognition of the hard work of local heroes who have emerged during the pandemic.People were in with a chance of winning a pound hotel voucher. Alison was one of  national winners.Isobel McCardie, who runs Rock My World Travel alongside her husband Mark, nominated Alison.Isobel, who lives in North Berwick, said: ldquoWhen I saw what Alison was doing, it instantly resonated with me.ldquoNot only was she on the frontline fighting Covid-, but her compassion for the patients inspired her to go further.ldquoAs soon as I saw the competition, I instantly thought of Alison. She has been completely selfless in this entire task and is working tirelessly, I canrsquot think of anyone who deserves a break more.On the nomination, Alison said: ldquoI only knew about it when she phoned me and told me Irsquod won. Itrsquos really nice that someone who doesnrsquot know me nominated me. Itrsquos amazing and flattering.Alison plans to take her colleague Rachel, who has been working tirelessly to help Alison with her campaign.When askedshe had decided where to go, Alison said: ldquoIrsquom not wanting to go too far. Irsquoll possibly go somewhere in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"alcohol-confiscated-youths-sent-back-midlothian","story":"As the Covid- restrictions are slowly eased, policing and our response is ing to a more recognised model.This week we have reinstated our appointments system where we can again come to you at a convenient time that fits into your day, deal with your enquiry over the phone or attend immediately where required.Officers are slowly ing to their normal working locations with new social distancing measures implemented and calls we are attending are more like what I would expect at this time of year.Face masks, particularly on public transport and in shops, have been a hot topic and the current guidance is that they must be worn.Police officers in the exercise of their duty are exempt from this however, I have instructed that unless it is an emergency, my officers will wear face masks in shops and on transport.In my last few columns, I have commented on a rise in large groups of youths congregating and in some instances causing anti-social behaviour.Over the past few weeks I have had additional patrols and resources allocated to this and we have worked closely with East Lothian Council Safer Community Team.What we have found is that groups of youths have been coming down from Midlothian and engaging in disorder with some youths from East Lothian.At the weekend, my officers dealt with a large gathering of youths who were dispersed and got buses back up to Midlothian.Some youths were charged, alcohol was confiscated and others will receive a letter home addressed to their parents through our Parental Advisory Lettersystem.This early action prevented disorder occurring later in the day and we will continue to do this over the coming weeks.Our road and speed checks across the hotspot and coastal areas continue and we have contributed signicantly to the national summer drug drink driving campaign.Our licensed premises and restaurants re-opened in line with the Scottish Government guidance and I am really pleased to say that we had no incidents reported and everyone enjoyed themselves sensibly.The beaches and beauty spots continue to bring people from all over Scotland and, now with the English school holidays started, further afield.Last weekend I witnessed first-hand the fantastic work done by East Lothian Council employees to keep the areas safe and clean in very challenging circumstances.The next stage of lockdown is still a while away and I ask that you all continue to follow the current guidelines set to keep yourself and others safe.If you are getting a holiday, I hope it is a pleasant one and that you get good weather to enjoy it."},{"url":null,"title":"wildlife-diary-studying-kingfisher","story":"Although Zan has always had an interest in photography, it was after moving to Scotland that she discovered a passion for wildle and now spends every spare moment pursuing that endeavour.This has led her to volunteering for multiple wildle charities, as well as studying for an MSc in Wildle, Biology and Conservation alongside her photography. In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable! I am incredibly grateful to Stuart and Gillian for reaching out to me and inviting me over.

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit. The people of Prestonpans certainly came out to show their support and for that we are truly grateful.ldquoWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the future Queen Lily [Bennion] and her royal court, as well as their families for their patience and understanding.

It was great to see so many of you as we travelled around as many streets as we could while visiting the members of the royal court.ldquoTo the royal court children, we didnrsquot want to forget that it would have been your day, we can still have your special day next year.ldquoTo Queen Lily, you were absolutely stunning, even reducing some of the committee to tears your mum and dad will be proud of you, the way you conducted yourself on what should have been your special day. To you, the community of Prestonpans for coming out and showing your appreciation as we passed by quietlyin our cars, doing the alternative gala parade.

council has already received two strikes over its ambitious plans to transform its town centres this month, with u-turns made twice on projects.At the start of July it unveiled its plans, which included introducing parking suspensions across town centres as it looked to create more space outside shops and relocate parking away from high streets.In Haddington town centre there was a furious response after cones and parking suspension notices went up over the first weekend of the changes, leaving traders and their customers fuming.Shop owners who had only just opened their doors feared the restrictions would stop costumers fromcoming to the market town and within days the council announced it was putting parking suspensions in all town centres on hold.Then last week, it announced plans to transform tourist hotspot North Berwickrsquos town centre and create a temporary -space car park on its iconic Elcho Green ndash a much-loved publicspace and putting green.The response from

It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

In the eighteenth century, the island was home to around fty distillers with each farm on the island operating at least one still producing whisky.This began to decline as tighter regulations from both the estate and the government were introduced. Although a large number of islanders were still making whisky illegally, this industry ceased completely in the nineteenth century.#Tiree Whisky Company Ltd was established by locals Alain Campbell and Ian Smith with the aim of reviving the spirit industry on an island with a rich heritage in the tradition.Local production of Tyree Gin began in February  and, once again, the island was home to an operational distillery - the first in  years.Hebridean Pink Gin is distilled with juniper, raspberries and sweet peels.

The makers of the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea have been slowly expanding their list of stockists across Scotland and the UK. saw them collect another swathe of awards including the Spirits Business Masters Medal for their packaging and design of their flagship product The Teasmith Original. They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT.

But it extends much further and deeper ndash a prime example is Army@TheFringe. which we have run in association with Summerhall since .It enables performing artists to present shows that raise issues about le in and out of unorm, and normally takes place at the Hepburn House drill hall which we transform into an Edinburgh Fringe venue.As head of the arts for the ArmyI believe itrsquos essential for us to work with, and support, independent artists. In fact, itrsquos more important now than ever given the number and scale of concerns we all face in todayrsquos world, from racism and inequality to love, hate, peace and war.The arts have an unrivalled capacity to make us think and feel about our world ndash what it was like in the past, how it is now and where itrsquos heading. By encouraging us to ask questions of ourselves, and others, they can promote debate and lay the foundations for positive change.When Covid- forced the cancellation of the Fringe we decided to move online and refocused in order to offer some support to the artists we were already working with and to the wider performing arts sector. The result is Army@TheVirtualFringe ndash three weeks of free screenings, workshops, rehearsed readings, discussions and live-from-home performances.Some give a foretaste of productions we aim to stage next year. But many will see writers, performers, set designers, photographers, musicians and others sharing ideas and expertise with performing artists hoping to put on shows where at the Fringe ndash or indeed anywhere.With the mountainous dficulties faced by the sector right now we hope this kind of skills sharing will contribute to the efforts so many people are making to help the performing arts rebuild. And for the public we hope that what we are offering will, alongside other recently announced initiatives, provide some continuity and fill a little of the gap left by the absence of the Fringe.We also want to give something back to an arts community which has shown so much interest in Army@TheFringe and has come to us with productions of the quality of  Soldiers, The Troth and Unicorns, Almost.As a photographer myself I try to capture images that have an authenticity and express something new or dferent about people or situations. Thatrsquos very much the essence of Army@TheFringe and other initiatives through which the Army engages with the arts. They support work that is powerful, informed and independent.In some cases they do that by inviting artists who want to create work about the Army to come ldquobehind the wire and give them access to the kind of people and experiences that interest them.At other times they provide a showcase for veterans who now work in the arts and whose work reflects lived experience.Both result in an authenticity that make productions all the more affecting and persuasive whether they are addressing how families cope with death or injury, the courage of gay soldiers in coming out, womenrsquos struggle for equality or the experiences of black and overseas personnel.The result is agenda-setting art that asks tough questions about our lives and our Army ndash something that matters greatly for a healthy, open society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-tell-us-england-plans-fix-economy","story":"Scots know that the UK has a pound trillion national debt and that is before you add the conveniently ignored pound billion created through quantitative easing to rescue the corrupt banking system or the pound billion the Bank of England invented a few weeks ago to give to the Treasury or the gaping deficit there will be in this yearrsquos Westminsterrsquos annual budget because of the Covid- pandemicrsquos devastating effect on the UK GDP. Westminster hasnrsquot balanced the books for years and the impending disaster caused by Brexit will only make things worse, we understand all of that. We also know that the devolved Scottish Government balances its budget and has no control over and is incapable of directly adding to the UK national debt. Any money Scotland gets from Westminster through the Barnett formula is not English largesse but simply some of our taxes being ed to where they were gathered.I reverse the question on our Unionist friends. What we Scots want to know is what England is going to do about the financial mismanagement of the UK economy, because the elected representatives we send to Westminster to reflect the views of the Scottish people simply cannot influence in any meaningful way what Westminster does. The facts are glaringly obvious that, despite years of austerity, England has failed to address fundamental flaws in our common economy and has compounded problems that have had and are having a detrimental effect on all the parts of our supposed union of equals. The distribution of wealth and its concentration in south-east England tells one all one needs to know about the role that Westminster plays and who controls it. HS encapsulates Westminster mentality.It may seem a risky gamble for Scotland to become independent, but then again to take to the leboats in the midst of a storm may also seem risky: but the only alternative is to cower onboard and drown with the sinking ship.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.AS the independence drum continues to beat ever louder and coronavirus acts as a possible catalyst or excuse for change around the world, I cant help but feel that the time is ripe to explore what might or should become of the land we now call Scotland.I cant speak for others but, for me, Scotland is ided both culturally and historically between Highland and Lowland, East Coast and West, not to mention the distinct nature of the people of the Northern Isles and the Scottish Borders. Dferent communities with dferent identities and dferent priorities. I do not see one homogenous nation.As a person with very deep roots in the Celtic West I feel far greater affinity with the people of Ireland than I do with many of the communities further east and south. This is not a conscious choice, rather a statement of personal orientation and belonging.The people of the Highlands and Islands have had an exceptionally poor deal from Edinburgh and its Lowland bastions in recent centuries. Infor backing the wrong horse in the , our precious Highland and Hebridean heartland has been decimated, its people and language oppressed, subjugated, burnt out and cleared. Are we supposed to say thank you As we move towards a second defining vote on our constitutional future I wonderI am alone in not wanting to be a pawn in a game that involves Edinburgh replacing Westminster only for Edinburgh then to cede power to Brussels  Why would you do that  Why work so hard and build so many expectations only to achieve so little If I am to vote for change then it has to mean something tangible and not simply switching one uncaring master for another. I will not be convinced that rejoining the EU is anything other than being party to a European Project that will ultimately lead to the creation of a new country called Europe. Whither Scotia then Can I perhaps dream of a new Atlantic nation from Argyll and the Clyde Islands to Caithness with a border on the Highland line  In control of its own destiny, freed from Lowland control yet living respectfully alongside one another We have great natural resources, pure water, clean air, abundant capacity for energy generation, magnetic scenery to draw the tourists, wide open spaces, world-leading foods and whisky and, above all, brilliant people with global reach. Who knows what we can achievewe can turn dust to seed, reap our own harvest and ring our own till Ill be honest and admit that I have no idea at this stage whether or not the people of the Highlands and Islands remotely share such a vision and how this could work economically but, in an age of iconoclasm and the redefinition of identity, no Lowland politician should assume that an independent Scotland would not, in turn, find itself broken up in time by those of us wishing to assert their fundamental right to self-determination.As the creation of Holyrood emboldened nationalism, so I hope that independence will, in turn, trigger an explosion in regional identity politics within Scotland itself. One step at a time.Fraser Kelly, Millport.THERE is a simple answer to Maggie Chettys questionwhy the Prime Minster wants to hang on to Scotland. It is because that is what the people of Scotland voted for in , in a fair and free democratic referendum. You would think she might remember that.Her letter also includes a fascinating reference to the UK benefiting from ious taxes, although of course the Scottish Governments own figures tell us that Scotland gets more out of the Union by way of revenues than it puts in. The tax mentioned by Ms Chetty that is most intriguing is the one on whisky, which looks an awful lot like the mythical whisky export tax so beloved of nationalist conspiracy theorists. Likewise, she has now added a fish tax and a beef tax.Which all begs a much better question than Ms Chettys:Scottish independence is such a great idea, why do its proponents have to tell so many lies to justy it Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.THERE seems to be growing concern that interpretation of the Hate Crime Bill presently going through Holyrood would have an adverse effect on freedom of speech , particularly as regards the aspect of \"stirring up hatred\" Could those of us who write to The Herald then run the risk of being accused of that crime by the overly sensitive taking offence at our use of language criticising them, their views or their actions and as a consequence stirring up hatred in their own breastnot where  The letterfrom David Stubley provides an interesting case study in what to me appears to be its deliberate use of language chosen in sum to be inflammatory and personally derogatory viz ldquolackeys\", \"toadying\", \"fallacious\", \"lie\", \"charlatan parties and their willing acolytes\", ldquo proven liar\" and \"used car salesman\".

practice ndash which seeks to change someones sexuality or gender identity ndash is a \"risk to public health\" and should be made a criminal offence.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called conversion therapy \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the UK Government willbring forward plans to ban it.Stars such as Sir Elton John have also recently backed calls to outlaw it.A petition has now been lodged in Holyrood calling on the Scottish Government to take action, attracting thousands of signatures and support from high-profile LGBT organisations.Tristan Gray, one of those named on the petition, said:\"We only discovered that its not already illegal quite recently, and we were quite shocked by it.\"The Scottish Government said conversion therapy is \"unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland\".However, it said the legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session \"is currently fully committed\".It said it \"fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy\" and will engage with officials ondevolved and reserved responsibilities.Gray,who is on the Scottish Greens policy committee, said conversion therapy is \"putting someone through a process that would erase their LGBT identity\".He pointed to moves to ban it in Canada, where officials have defined it as seeking \"to change an inidualrsquos sexual orientation to heterosexual, to repress or reduce non-heterosexual attraction or sexual behaviours, or to change an inidualrsquos gender identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth\".The Canadian legislation, which was introduced earlier this year, proposes five new criminal offences related to conversion therapy.These include causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy,causing a person to undergo it against their will and profiting from or advertising conversion therapy.The Holyrood petitioners insist the practice has \"damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and adults and continues to do so\".They quoted a report from the charity Stonewall, which found  per cent of health and care staff had witnessed colleagues expressing the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people can be ldquocured of their sexual orientation.They also referenced a survey by theOzanne Foundation, which works withreligious organisations to eliminate discrimination based on sexuality or gender.This found .% of respondents had ldquobeen advised to consider attempts to change their sexual orientationand just over one in sevenhad ldquovoluntarily considered it.The petitioners said: \"Concerningly, .% of LGBT+ respondents had been forced to go through attempts to change their sexual orientation.\"Almost two-thirds, .%, had \"suffered from mental health issues\" as a result of the conversion therapy, including nearly a third who said they had attempted suicide.The Holyrood petition notes: \"These responses clearly show that there is a signicant public health case for banning conversion therapy.\"The experiences of those who were put through this practice show that enforcing this ban should fall under criminal law.\"Both of these areas fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament.\"It said the UK Government has yet to act despite committing to end the practice years ago.It added: \"Given this information, it is clear that conversion therapy is a risk to public health, especially the mental health of vulnerable young adults and children.\"There is broad support for its criminalisation by those who have been subjected to it, and, as healthcare and criminal justice matter, we believe it to be within the scope of the Scottish Governmentrsquos powers to ensure this practice is brought to an end.\"Gray raised concerns the UK plans will be kicked into the long grass.The -year-old said: \"I think it should fall under criminal law, and that is something that is shared by people who have undergone it.\"People who have been through conversion therapy overwhelmingly support it being banned, and I think half of them support it being an area for criminal law.\"I think they are the people who should be listened to on this.\"People who have been subjected to conversion therapy should be the people we listen to most.\"I think it should come down under criminal law, and I think the justication for that partly includes it being a public health issue.\"He said it is an issue that should gain \"universal support\" from Scotlands political parties.Jordan Daly, co-founder of Time for Inclusive Education , a charity working to address anti-LGBT bullying in schools, is one of those backing the petition.He said: ldquoConversion or reparative therapies should have been outlawed a long time ago, and practices which ly claim to change, cure or repair an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity or expression have been shown time and again to be emotionally and psychologically traumatic on those who have experienced and survived such programs.\"He said practices which rely on \"using emotionally exploitative tactics to encourage feelings of shame and repression in iniduals are active in Scotland right now\".He added: \"We support this petition and the efforts of campaigners to continue raising awareness about the existence of dangerous and shameful practices in our country.\"Scotland has an opportunity to lead the UK here, and ensure that no other LGBT person, young or old, experiences this ndash ministers and parliamentarians should not delay in taking it.SNP equalities minister Christina McKelvie said: ldquoWe do not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy.\"It is unethical, harmful and has no place in Scotland.\"We fully support moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, and are engaging with them as they develop proposals.ldquoThe legislative timetable for the current parliamentary session is currently fully committed.\"We are continuing to engage with officials in the UK Government on their thinking

Theatre buildings are designed on that premise.ldquoTo have performers socially distant would demand creation from scratch of an entirely new repertoire of work right across all performance genres.She added: ldquoFor obvious reasons large gatherings were first to close down, in the same vein we anticipate theatres to be the last to open up again.ldquoFrom having spoken to our network of venue operators across the country, the general consensus, at this point in time, is that March or April  is the most likely date for the theatre industry to restart.ldquoMargins for Capital Theatres, as a large-scale commercial operator, are tight.

I really believe that hersquos the victim, and now I feel sad because I believe hersquos been fully corrupted.The book claims that, after a newspaper revealed the location of his home in , Mr Markle rejected constant media requests with a line prepared for him by royal officials which stated: ldquoI canrsquot speak out of respect for my family.The Duchess and Prince Harry Harry told him to do his best to ignore the press, but ultimately ndash with encouragement from the Duchessrsquos elder half-sister Samantha ndash Mr Markle accepted a proposal from photographer Jeff Rayner, according to the book.Mr Markle agreed to participate in several set-up photographs, including one of him reading a book on British history while at a cafe. The pictures were published around the world, with Mr Rayner earning , , and Mr Markle and daughter Samantha sharing  per cent of the proceeds, it has been claimed.A week before the royal wedding, Kensington Palace officials heard a Sunday newspaper was planning to expose the photo-shoot as having been staged.The book states palace communications staff and lawyers were moving to have publication stopped, as the Duchess phoned her father. ldquoDad, we need to knowthis is true or not, because my team is going to try and stop this story from running ndashyou are telling me itrsquos fake, she reportedly told him.ldquoIf they do that, theyrsquore going out of their way to protect you, dad. ldquoYoursquore telling me yoursquore being victimised, right Mr Markle had replied ldquoOf course, failing to admit he had participated in the staging of the photos, which were duly exposed as set-ups in the press the next day.Despite his deception, the Duchess had still wanted her father at her wedding. He ultimately did not attend, partly due to suffering a heart attack days before the event, which he blamed on the stresses of pressure from the media.ldquoAs much as she was hurt and humiliated, she wanted him to be there and was willing to move on, an unidentied friend is quoted as saying.ldquoPlus, she was worried about him she honestly wasnrsquot surehe was actually okay. His behaviour was bizarre.The book gives further glimpses of the Duchessrsquos troubled relationship with Mr Markle, including a string of uned phone messages and texts from the former actress to her father in the days before her wedding.The book, which is being serialised in The Times, also includes a number of claims about the couplersquos relationship with other royals and the aides who worked for them.The book claims Prince Harry perceived his brother, William, as ldquosnobby when he warned him not to rush with ldquothis girl and accused him of being ldquoblinded by lust.There are also accusations that the Duchess of Cambridge was not welcoming toward Meghan and ldquosnubbed her at a royal event.Palace insiders are also said to have described Meghan as ldquoHarryrsquos showgirl, and made comments about her coming with a ldquolot of baggage. However, friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are said to have issued a fierce defence, telling the Mail on Sunday the couple had ldquorolled out the red carpet for Meghan and ldquodone all they could to welcome the actress into the Royal Family.According to reports, the Cambridges invited them to Anmer Hall, their family home in Norfolk, where Kate personally cooked for Meghan, organised a party for their friends and the wedding party before the  wedding, and invited Meghan to the Royal Box at Wimbledon.A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said the couple did not contribute to Finding Freedom.The spokesman said: ldquoThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom.

However, a more emotion-centred focus is in evidence north of the Border.While warning against seeing the issue in binary terms, Ruth McKay, headteacher at Portobello High in Edinburgh, one of Scotlandrsquos biggest schools, is following an approach that she acknowledges will be viewed as ldquotowards the relationships end of the spectrum.Ms McKay said a personalised welcome for each pupil at the start of class ndash which could range from a simple hello to a namaste greeting ndash was among measures she hopes will boost emotional connections between teachers and children.ldquoSome of our young people will have been going through very challenging circumstances over the last few months, dealing with issues such as domestic abuse, substance abuse or financial hardship ndash our staff have been delivering food parcels throughout lockdown, she said.ldquoWe know others have felt overwhelmed or isolated. So wersquore anticipating a need for increased additional support for young people as weto school and our staff will be prepared for that.ldquoIf a young person is presenting in a distressed way ndash we wouldnrsquot talk about bad behaviour or challenging behaviour ndash the first question we as staff will ask ourselves is, what has been going on for that young person  And the next one is, how can we support them Ms McKay said a key focus in the coming weeks and months would be strengthening teacher-pupil bonds.ldquoOne of the things that we already ask all staff in the school to do is meet and greet young people when they arrive for lessons during the course of the school day, she said.ldquoRather than the class filing in and sitting down, chatting while they wait for the others to arrive, the teacher is on the door and will greet each young person as they enter. They might ask how that young person is doing, or say lsquoglad to see you backrsquo, or lsquoI loved your essayrsquo. Itrsquos a way of creating microinteractions, of giving teachers a split-second sense about how a pupil is doing.ldquoWhat we will be doing when weis continuing to find ways to create those little interactions. Of course, in the case of the personalised greeting at the start of class, it wonrsquot [because of Covid] be a handshake but it could be simply saying hello, or a namaste greeting ndash the teachers and young people will find ways of doing that.ldquo[In terms of space to address emotions], we run a range of groups and programmes and itrsquos a topic thatrsquos explored in Personal and Social Education, or assemblies, which might run virtually to start with, when wersquoll talk to young people about the emotions that they might be feeling as we re-engage after lockdown.Portobello Highrsquos approach has echoes where in Scotland, with St Bridersquos Primary in Cambuslang making emotional-regulation sessions available to all children, staff and parents.Plans have also been put together to ensure every secondary in Scotland has access to a mental heath counsellor.Writing for TES, developmental psychologist Suzanne Zeedyk describes such initiatives as practical examples of how schools could create ldquospace for talking about feelings and enable children to ldquobe in touch with, and to manage, their emotions.She contrasts this with the views of Tom Bennett, an adviser to the Department for Education at Westminster, who argues that clear expectations and policies on behaviour will be crucial as campuses reopen in the age of Covid.ldquoGood behaviour is the core mission for every school, whatever age or stage, he wrote in a recent online article.ldquoGet behaviour right and everything  is possible. Mr Bennett said students ldquomust be explicitly told the consequences for behaviour that threatens distancing measures, respiratory or tactile hygiene, are very serious indeed, and added that ldquomalicious, deliberate acts of transmissionshould be ldquotreated with the greatest seriousness.Amy Forrester, director of pastoral care in Cockermouth School in Cumbria, has a similar view.ldquoThere is talk of lsquorecovery curricularsquo, lsquoemotional wellbeing daysrsquo and lsquosignicant pastoral timersquo as part of the reopening provision, she wrote in an article for TES.ldquoWhile this is well-intentioned, I passionately believe that focusing on wellbeing interventions is, at best, misguided and, at worst, dangerous. What children need most after a time of signicant disruption to their lives is normality. Pastoral leaders, more than most, know the importance of routine, boundaries and normality following a period of challenge in a young personrsquos le.For Ms McKay, discipline and maintaining a Covid-secure school environment are, of course, vital ndash but so are feelings and relationships.ldquoThe approach that we have built up at Portobello High would generally be seen as more towards the relationships end of the spectrum, she said.ldquoThatrsquos not to say we do not have high expectations of our pupils, itrsquos about how we go about realising those.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ldquoThe Deputy First Minister has been clear that in planning for theto school, children and young peoplersquos wellbeing should be at the centre of considerations. Education authorities and schools already have a wide range of approaches and strategies in place to support pupilsrsquo wellbeing and we are committed to strengthening the resources available for that purpose. That includes investing in access to a counsellor in every secondary school and developing new mental health training for school staff."},{"url":null,"title":"world-bank-adviser-rbs-name-change-sign-decline","story":"With assets of more than . trillionndash more than the UKrsquos entire gross domestic product ndash it was on top of the world in .Yet the following year, the bank found itself on the brink of collapse, forced to seek a Government bail-out worth tens of billions of pounds as the global economic crisis raged.Last week, in a re-brand aimed at moving on from this troubled period, the institution, which was founded in , formally dropped ldquoScotland from its name and is now known as Natwest Group.The change does not affect branches. Chief executive Alison Rose described the development as ldquohistoric.However, one of Scotlandrsquos leading economists has warned it is not only sad but also symptomatic of a far more serious underlying trend.Tony Mackay, a professor of economics and adviser to the World Bank, said: ldquoFor a long time, RBS was one of the biggest banks... in the world. And we also had Clydesdale Bank and Bank of Scotland. And what has happened is those banks have shrunk and been taken over.ldquoI just think that,  or  years ago, the three banks... had an excellent reputation internationally but theyrsquove all gone steadily downhill. RBS changing its name to Natwest is a symbol of that decline.Mr Mackay suggested the issue was sector-wide. ldquoIrsquove spent much of the last  or  years working overseas andI told people I came from Scotland, theyrsquod say, ah ndash thatrsquos where you have all those banks and financial services, he added.ldquoNow the banks and financial services in Scotland do not have a strong international reputation. And I think the loss of the Scottish name from RBS is a signicant sign of that loss of reputation.Mr Mackay said a major part of the problem had been worsening standards of service. ldquoRBS is, admittedly, probably a bit dferent from the others, he said. ldquoThe UK Government is still the largest shareholder in RBS. But I think that, along with the other two, consolidation and amalgamation have meant that lots of the best people have left, or moved to London. And I would say the standard of service offered by RBS, Clydesdale and Bank of Scotland has declined.ldquoMy experience in dealing with them now is that you cannot speak to a bank manager, yoursquore put through to a computer and it says nohellip The standard of service has declined signicantly, I would say.ldquoI think RBS, Clydesdale and Bank Scotland have become much less willing to provide loans to business in Scotland. I just donrsquot see them as active as they were in supporting local industry. They have become more risk-averse.Mr Mackayrsquos criticisms have been strongly rejected by senior figures at industry body Scottish Financial Enterprise. Graeme Jones, the organisationrsquos chief executive, said the sector was ldquohighly regarded within the UK and internationally.He added: ldquoFor the seventh consecutive year, our credentials as a global leader in financial services were further reinforced by securing the most foreign direct investment in the UK after London. We know talented people with sought-after skills is a key factor in firms expanding or relocating their business here, which is vital for economic growth and providing more opportunities for people who live, study and work here.Mr Jones also highlighted Scotlandrsquos strength in developing the technology and software that underpins todayrsquos financial services industry.ldquoOur thriving fintech cluster is one of the strongest in Europe, with the number of fintech SMEs increasing by more than  per cent from  in  to  this year, he said.ldquoAs an industry, we employ more than , people across banking, le and pensions, asset management, and professional services all of whom are working extremely hard to ensure millions of personal and business customers continue to have access to financial services in its many forms during this dficult time, with frontline colleagues, such as those working in branches and contact centres, going above and beyond to support vulnerable people, families and businesses.Natwest Group and Lloyds Banking Group, which is the parent company of Bank of Scotland, declined to comment.

Having become used to being followed by the cameras, lockdown restrictions meant he had to take over filming as the crew left just as the croft entered one of its busiest times of the year.In the three-part series, Donald, , is seen trying to take in rapidly changing and momentous global events as the pandemic evolves while getting on with the traditional tasks associated with le on his croft.The three-part series reveals the impact of Covid- as the former young crofter of the year entered a lambing season without help, and his reactions to the crisis as it sparked panic buying in shops, grounded airlines and closed down businesses.ldquoIrsquove watched the programmes now, and itrsquos really interesting to see how scared and confused I was, he said.ldquoTherersquos a point in March when Irsquom filmed asking about what social distancing was. Now, of course, itrsquos part of day to day language but at the time we hadnrsquot heard of it.ldquoYou forget so much of what happened. Now when you look back, itrsquos hard to believe how much has changed.As the rest of the country was came to terms with lockdown restrictions and limited time outdoors, Donald was in the grip of one of the busiest periods of le on the croft.ldquoAs soon as lockdown started, lambing began. I was in a lsquolambing bubblersquo for the first six weeks of lockdown, he recalled.ldquoI was avoiding most of the news because I was so busy. I was concerned and anxious, but I didnrsquot have the time or energy to find out too much about what was going on. ldquoI was probably lucky to have the distraction of lambing.While tackling lambing and other jobs alone left him exhausted, he says he appreciates how lucky crofters and other islanders have been compared to some others.ldquoPeople have really appreciated they were not stuck in a flat somewhere without a garden. We have crofts that we can go outside and work on.The series has shown Donald investing in modern equipment including Shetland-made Polycrubs, tunnels made from redundant pipe from fish farms and designed to withstand harsh island gales, and ersying into new income streams such as meat boxes in order to keep the croft going.However, the latest series concludes with him reflecting on the troubled times caused by the pandemic.Meanwhile, he suggests the croftersrsquo way of le might be one that many will be following to a small extent. ldquoLiving on an island, we spend summer thinking about preparing for winter, he said.ldquoWersquore cutting peat, preparing animal feed, filling our freezers because we know that the ferries arenrsquot always sailing, and you canrsquot always get what you want from the shops. ldquoI wouldnrsquot be surpriseda lot of other people are also thinking about what might happen come winter and are doing the same.An Lot - An Glasadh The Croft - The Lockdown, tonight, .pm.

Currently, we predict a shortfall of income running into tens of millions of pounds.The fears of Glasgowrsquos leaders for its artistic and sporting heritage ndash including its Royal Concert Hall or Fruitmarket with their annual half a million visitors ndash come as it becomes increasingly clear the sectors are being devastated by the pandemic.Yesterday, The Herald on Sunday revealed some performing arts venues will be forced to raise ticket prices to cut the risk of Covid amid concerns there is ldquono such thing as a socially distant theatre.At the beginning of this month, Ms Hyslop announced poundm in targeted support for performance arts venues. The UK Government has pledged another poundm to help keep the arts in Scotland afloat.Sector insiders do not believe this money will be enough, as the scale of Glasgow Lersquos financial problems demonstrates.The charity receives about poundm a year from the council to deliver its core services. But it supplements this core funding with fees for everything from swimming pools and gyms and admissions to concerts and events. Its famous museums do not charge visitors but partly make up for this with money from gt shops, cafes and one-off special exhibitions.Glasgow Le is understood to have offset some of its fixed costs by furloughing hundreds of workers involved in this commercial operation. But it has to cover the full wage bills of its core workers.In their letter, Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald, who chairs Glasgow Le, stressed that Glasgow was far more economically dependent on its arts and sports sector than other parts of Scotland.Moreover, city spending on arts and sports delivers a dramatic multiplier effect.The city leaders wrote: ldquoSince , tourism to Glasgow has grown from . million to . million visitors. Spend has grown from pound million to pound million over the same period, helping sustain more than , jobs in the city.ldquoOne of the major draws for tourists to our city is our world-class civic collection and museums service.ldquoMore people visit Glasgowrsquos museums each year than in any other UK city outside of London, with visits reaching more than four million last year. Our museums service is perhaps the most efficient and effective in the country, delivering nice museums on a budget of pound million, with no national funding: compare that to the National Museums of Scotlandrsquos pound.m budget from Government and . million visitors annually.\"Ms Aitken and Mr McDonald also stressed the value of live music. Glasgow is behind Manchester and London for music tourism but its concerts still generate poundm from visitors to the city every year, they said.Earlier this month Glasgow Le published a schedule for re-opening its venues. Only a third were included in its first phase. Kelvingrove will open its doors in the middle of August the riverside transport museum at the end of the month losing all the income they would have received during the school holidays.This echoes a nationwide pattern. The Association of Scottish Visitor Attractions last month found that nearly half of the nationrsquos museums, galleries, castles and other historic sites may remain closed until .Normally  million people would go through the doors of Glasgow Le venues every year.Mr McDonald told The Herald: ldquoWe have always had a great working relationship with the Scottish Government but now wersquore asking them to step up more, to ensure that the huge contribution Glasgow Le can make to Glasgow and Scotlandrsquos economic and social recovery is fully realised and not held back by the unavoidable financial challenges that have resulted from this global pandemic and lockdown.The city council has been supporting Glasgow Le through the lockdown and is getting some extra money from central governments to cope with extra Covid costs.Insiders stress that local authorities across Scotland have lost substantial revenue while their commercial centres were closed. Glasgowrsquos council-owned City Parking already operates at a loss. But during the lockdown it stopped charging for parking as it tried to help key workers get to their jobs safely. Its very future as an armrsquos- body is now up for debate, insiders say.A Scottish Government spokesperson said it is a ldquohugely challenging and concerning time\" for those in the culture and heritage sector.\"We are doing all we can to support them during the Covid- pandemic,\" added the spokesperson. ldquoYesterday, we announced a new pound million Resilience and Recovery Fund for independent museums and we continue to have discussions with Museums Galleries Scotland to understand the support needs of the wider sector, including local authority museums and arms- external organisations, such as Glasgow Le, which face future funding challenges.ldquoWe are also working closely with other cultural and heritage funders to ensure a co-ordinated response."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: £, to companies for every furloughed worker still employed as of  January  £ BILLION Kickstart scheme to create jobs for --year-olds VAT CUT TO % for tourism  hospitality for the next  months With these measures and more, the UK Government is helping protect livelihoods in Scotland and across the rest [hellip]copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app.Health officials are working hard to prevent a second deadly surge of the virus, which has claimed more than  lives since it first arrived here. However, concerns have been raised about a lack of information over the location and extent of emerging clusters, particularly as shielding is due to be paused on Friday.Health officials have provided some information to the public about clusters, but have so far only confirmed the location of the cluster arising from the karaoke party.The PHA revealed that since the start of the Limavady cluster  cases have been added to the contact tracing database, while  contacts had been identied.Read More Limavady Covid- spike linked to microphone passed around at house party karaoke sessionThe PHA declined to provide any further information, stating that it may result in people being identied. This is despite growing calls for clarity over the location of clusters to enable the public, particularly those most at risk from the virus, to take additional measures to protect themselves when it is active in their community.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, said: I recognise the challenge for the PHA in ensuring that patient confidentiality is assured as part of the contact tracing process and we now have good evidence that contact tracing is fundamentally working in identying and following up clusters.Nevertheless, in a public health emergency we must also have public information so that the public can make decisions about how to go about their daily lives safely.I would still wish to see more information about the locality of clusters immediately when they are identied, and about the nature of clusters in due course, so we can identy clearly what specic activities are leading to #superspreading#.Shielding is pausing on Friday for the , people who were warned their lives are at riskthey become ill with Covid-.They have received limited advice about what is safe from Friday, which includes a recommendation that they should continue to work from home where possible. At the same time it has emerged that  clusters have been identied here since May , with more expected in the coming months.

Both apps were designed by Co Waterford company NearForm.Speaking to the Belfast , Stephen Shaw from Big Motive, the company that designed the app, explained that there is a real concern amongst those involved in its development that the general public may not be aware just how useful the contact tracing service could be.You#re talking about avoiding potential future lockdowns, he stated. All of the code, information and everything about the app will be open sourced and public.Read More Pub worker blames coronavirus visor for fall down stairs and is suing Dublin barAnyone that#s worried about it tracking them will be able to access everything about the app and see and check that it#s not doing anything untoward.The Information Commissioner#s Office has been through everything. The higher echelons of the UK Government has scrutinised all elements of it too.People can be genuinely confident that it#s not doing anything dodgy.The app is compatible with the contact tracing service available in the Republic of Ireland and is expected to work with the app being created by the NHS in Great Britain.Mr Shaw explained that this is due to a federated server which is currently being developed for the app.This server will also allow the app to work with other European countries who have a tracing service in the same format, something Mr Shaw called a world first.When asked why Northern Ireland will be the first country in the United Kingdom to launch the app, Mr Shaw praised the work of the Department of Health#sChief Digital Information Officer, Dan West, and the app#s product manager, Dr Eddie O#Neill.Dan West is leading the project and he has been super dynamic and extremely good at bringing together all dferent aspects like the DoH and the Public Health Agency, he said.Along with Dr Eddie O#Neill, the pair of them seem to have a great handle on the subtleties of what technology should be used. The two of them have been instrumental.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island.Mr Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the inability of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other. In the letter, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing serious impediments in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country.Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for  days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within  hours of entering Northern Ireland.He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.

The Irish News has reported that  clusters linked to  positive cases of the virus have been identied through contact tracing since May . Six of these clusters had more than five positive cases of Covid- associated with them. Alliance health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw said the nature of those clusters must be revealed. Earlier this month a cluster of Covid- cases was identied in Limavady, believed to be linked to a house party were a karaoke microphone was passed around.The PHA has confirmed that another cluster has been identied in Ballymena and they are monitoring developments. A spokesperson said the PHA is aware of a number of cases in the Ballymena area that may be associated with a cluster.A cluster is defined as two or more cases among Covid- deriving from the same place with the onset of the illness within  days. Multiple cases of Covid- in a single household is not classed as an outbreak. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAlliance MLA Paula Bradshaw FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAlliance MLA Paula BradshawMs Bradshaw said she had asked questions about outbreaks in particular locations, but had been told these were just matters of increased transmission. The South Belfast MLA, who earlier this week cancelled a family holiday to Italy after confusion around travel guidance, said it was important to identy what was being learned from contact tracing. “Now it turns out that the recently publicised case near Limavady is one of sixteen since  May. The issue is we have not been informed about the nature of these clusters and, particularly, how they originated, Ms Bradshaw said. “A public health emergency needs public support and therefore good public information. That means the public must be fully informed about the types of behaviour which have proven particularly dangerous in terms of leading to super-spreading events.The Alliance MLA urged Health Minister Robin Swann to ensure the Public Health Agency publishes information about the nature of each cluster and what we can learn from it.A PHA spokesperson said clusters of cases were to be expected during the pandemic. The Public Health Agencywill not comment on inidual cases or go into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested, the spokesperson said.To date the majority of clusters that have occurred have been managed effectively through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.A Department of Health spokesperson said the contact, trace and protect approach had proved highly effective in preventing the further spread of Covid-.We must be aware that Covid- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading, the spokesperson said.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11607885.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Much better first to upgrade the A east of Stranraer. Above is a part of the road that was upgraded to bypass the village of Dunragit, but the overwhelming bulk of the -mile road to England is single carriageway, in which traffic can get stuck behind tractorsIt was mid - financial slump, and all sorts of businesses were struggling. Private transport services were being cut.My concern was that the PO fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan, which had just begun for the  summer season, might not survive.It needed support, I wrote. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Sure enough, within years the fast ferry was withdrawn .Axing the Larne-Cairnryan fast boat was a sad milestone in the history of movement on these islands.It was the fastest passenger sea link that has ever existed between Ireland and Great Britain, making the journey in an hour. Even the Belfast-Stranraer Seacat express of the s took  minutes.Travel does not always get faster as history progresses. After the Roman empire collapsed, roads in Europe decayed.When Concorde stopped flying in , the public could no longer make transatlantic crossings on passenger planes in just four hours. And since PO ceased running the fast ferry, it has not been possible to cross the Irish Sea or North Channel in one hour on any scheduled, car-carrying vessel. It might never be possible again.This is all the more disappointing given that there is now dual carriageway or motorway the whole distance from Belfast to Larne.The road was upgraded because it forms part of European E route, from Larne to Rosslare. In fact, most of the road between those two ports is now motorway or high quality dual. Yet the ports themselves have lost key ferry services.This is all relevant now because Boris Johnson has approved a feasibility study into his idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland.The idea has many critics, who describe it as a fantasy, yet engineers have said it can be built.But last year there was surprise, even scoffing, when I predicted on a radio discussion show that it would not happen for  years at the very earliest.Some people alive today might see such a structure, but that is mainly because children in  might live into the  century.There are longer bridges in the world than the  miles from Donaghadee to Portpatrick but none passes over a , foot trench.So it would be the most impressive bridge in the world. If any country can build it, the UK, which was once an infrastructure pioneer, and which is the world’s sixth richest nation, can.The problem is that traffic between NI and Scotland is minuscule by international standards.In summer  I passed through the Channel Tunnel, months after it opened, and remember the passenger excitement as our train went from Kent countryside into the tunnel, then emerged into French daylight. That massive triumph of engineering was the culmination of  years of plans for a physical link between England and France.It also connected two cities of almost  million people each, London-Paris, on one of the world’s busiest corridors. NI-Scotland is nowhere near such numbers.A bridge would be doing well to get , vehicles a day paying £ each per crossing, and even then the £+ million annual revenue might only cover the immense security and upkeep costs, let alone giveon the multi billion pound outlay cost.The short-term feasibility of a bridge is akin to unrealistic calls for high speed rail from Belfast to Londonderry, cities of , and , respectively.Not even France, with the best rail infrastructure in the world, has high speed link between two far bigger cities that I have often visited, Bordeaux-Toulouse, which are a mere  miles apart with a combined population of  million.It is unfair to dismiss a bridge to Scotland as a fantasy, better to label it as a distant dream.It cannot be, as Mr Johnson hopes, a boost to the Union because we can’t be sure of the exact constitutional make-up of these islands many decades into the future.As a letter writer says opposite , there are less costly infrastructure projects we need to do first such as improve the road from Stranrarer Cairnryan toM English border.Even that is a hugely expensive project for a road with low traffic levels. But parts of it, such a busier -mile section east of Dumfries, could plausibly be dualled.The value of such an upgrade is evident in an alternative road route to England, the A from Holyhead to the Welsh mainland. I have driven Belfast-London many times since the s and have seen how the best route has changed from being via Stranraer to via Holyhead.This is due to there now being a motorway to Dublin, including a tunnel that goes direct to the port. Then there is dual carriageway or motorway in Wales, so you no longer get stuck behind tractors in Anglesey, as you still do in Galloway.Theof a one-hour fast ferry from Larne to Cairnryan and the upgrade of much of the A would radically improve our links to Scotland and be many, many times cheaper than a bridge.Mr Johnson must know that the Union faces real political threats. One of the dangers right now is the rise in Scottish nationalism.In Northern Ireland, unionists face structural disadvantages.For example, mandatory coalition at Stormont facilitates republicans who want NI to fail. Politicians who are less hostile to the status quo tend to want to maintain their seats and livelihoods. Naturally they are inclined to appease the radicals.London should also try to balance a situation in which Dublin officials echo nationalist demands while the UK keeps sending us uninformed secretaries of state, who are influenced by an NIO that is, at best, neutral on unionism.These are urgent problems for the Union.

The party made constraints on ministers one of its centre-piece demands for the restoration of Stormont, yet now, under a dferent leadership, it is helping to push through legislation that will remove those constraintsThis bill, which has been rushed through the assembly in a matter of weeks and has to date received little or no legislative scrutiny, will fundamentally affect decision-making in Northern Ireland.From the public comment on the bill, there is no appreciation of the implications of some of the proposed changes. Instead,MLAs are sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments. Twenty years ago ministers enjoyed considerable autonomy in relation to decisions within their department and famously the then minister for education abolished the eleven plus exam on his last day in office without recourse to the executive.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Richard Bullick, a former barrister, was special advisor to Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster as first ministerAllowing ministers such power within their departmental remits did not sit well with democratic accountability or joined up government and the DUP made the reform of these arrangements a centre-piece of its terms for the restoration of devolution. Admittedly, there was also a signicant element of being able to limit the capacity of Sinn Fein ministers to pursue their political and constitutional agenda. In a  policy document, the party argued that legislation “would be required to ensure that ultimate power would rest with the executive as opposed to the inidual departments”. To be clear the DUP’s intention was to ensure that any important decision could be required to secure executive approval and the resulting provisions meant that unionistconsent was required. The provisions that were legislated for were complex and interlocking. The underlying objective was achieved in two carefully worded statutory tests for which decisions would require executive approval. These arrangements operated successfully from  and on only a few occasions did DUP ministers feel compelled to go to court to successfully enforce the arrangements the party had largely devised. The rationale for the present bill arises out of a Court of Appeal decision to the effect that a signicant planning application required executive approval. Understandably, the executive wished to bring forward an amendment to recty that situation, but more controversially it has also chosen to amend a provision relating the carefully calibrated tests for executive approval more generally. There is little evidence that the drafters of the objectionable clauses of the bill were informed of the purpose of the original provisions. As a result the proposed changes seriously undermine the DUP’s claim to have a veto on all important decisions in NI. The essential purpose of the amendment is to redefine a test for full executive consideration in a way which would increase ministerial autonomy. This was done by limiting the meaning of what constitutes a ‘cross-cutting’ matter, reducing the range of decisions that have to come to the executive. Why then are DUP the appearing to be reversing a long-standing policy  My view is that it is not a change of policy but flows from misconceptions in what is a complex area of law.Firstly, there is a custom and practice argument which asserts that the new clause reflects the sort of matters that actually come before the executive for decision. While this may be true, it also entirely misses the point. The real issue is not what normally comes to the executive, but what can be required to come where other ministers take exception to a proposed decision.Secondly, there is the argument that the legislation restores the test for what constitutes cross-cutting to the standard which existed before the Buick decision , but after the changes brought about by the  St Andrews Agreement. The new test for cross-cutting would mean that there would be no requirement for executive agreement, “unless that matter affects the exercise of the statutory responsibilities of one or more other ministers more than incidentally”. Notably, there is no mention of ‘statutory’ responsibilities in paragraph  of the Belfast Agreement. This distinction has signicant application for s where there is no statutory underpinning for what departments do in practice. Even more signicantly the “more than incidentally” requirement, above, is demonstrably a greater level of “cross-cutting” than requirements which have already been found to satisfy the statute by the courts. These include reference to, “touches on” JR  “issues arise in a multitude of less obvious circumstances” Central Craigavon, “engages the responsibility of ious Ministers” Minister for Enterprise Trade and Investment.Self-evidently,the intention of the new clause had been to reflect previous case law, then the language in those judgments could have been deployed for statutory purposes. It was not. Thirdly, misplaced comfort may be taken by what is known as the ‘signicant or controversial’ test, though this simplication ignores a crucial second limb of the provision, which also requires the decision to be ‘clearly outside the scope of the agreed programme’ for government. The boundaries of this limitation are unclear, though unambiguously it weakens the short-hand catch-all test. And fourthly, it has been suggested, both at the Executive Office Committee and in the assembly, that the so-called ‘three minister call in’ provision in the legislation provides an ultimate safety net. This provision, it is said, would allow any three ministers to require a matter to come to the executive and deprive the minister of the authority to take such a decision .As the argument goes, there being four DUP ministers, this provides the needed assurance for unionists fearful of republican ministers going on ‘solo runs’. The logic of this argument is impeccable but for one rather fundamental defect. No such provision exists.This regrettable conclusion is reached, not by recourse to case law or obtuse statutory interpretation, but by a simple Google search of the relevant legislation, namely ‘section  Northern Ireland Act ’. As this safeguard has been widely cited in aid of the new provision, it is safe to assume that the entire bill is predicated upon this mistaken assumption. This is not a solid foundation for constitutional legislation. Problematically for the movers of the bill is that fact that they have to convince assembly members that the legislation, with the amendment, means exactly the same as the legislation did without it. The only intervening event was a judgment by lord chief justice where he interpreted the statute consistent with the approach the DUP have always advocated.All is not yet lost. Doug Beattie MLA has put down amendments to remove the dangerous aspects of the bill, while leaving in place the sensible provisions. These should be supported leaving the contentious aspect the bill to another day.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sure enough, as soon as Harry put out his declaration, the statement dominated the news cycle.ldquoThe team at Clarence House, which had spent months putting together Prince Charlesrsquos tour in the hopes that it would be covered signicantly, was crushed.Extracts from the book, due to be published by HQ on August , have also covered claims the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotherrsquos ldquosnobbish attitude to his bride, and suggestions the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. vw,vw,px, px\"A new book on Harry and Meghan has described how relations between the Sussexes and the Cambridges grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking Harry confirmed he was dating US actress Meghan Markle in the November  statement and lashed out at the ldquowave of abuse and harassment she has faced from the media.In a y and strongly-worded statement, Harryrsquos Communications Secretary Jason Knauf outlined the dficulties Miss Markle had experienced since news of their relationship broke.Mr Knauf said ldquoThe past week has seen a line crossed. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment.He added: ldquoPrince Harry is worried about Ms Marklersquos safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her.It was the first official confirmation from Kensington Palace that the pair were dating.News of the royal romance emerged around a week before the statement was issued, with The Sunday Express reporting the pair met in May while Harry was in Canada promoting Invictus Games , the paralympics-style competition for injured servicemen and women and veterans he founded..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Clarence House  ucrushed u after Harry and Meghan relationship overshadowed tour article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
