It was shot at a Somali refugee camp in Mandera, Kenya, and is part of the artist’s 25-year journey documenting displaced minorities affected by war and catastrophe.This photo and roughly 150 others are on view in an exhibition opening at the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago, which runs until 29 September. Guest curated by the Nigerian American writer Teju Cole, who is also the photography critic at the New York Times Magazine, the show, entitled Go Down Moses, reflects on human suffering.But looking through the images, which range from a toddler at a homeless shelter to a desolate road shot at night, Cole looked for a throughline to put together “a visual analogy”.“When I look at these photos, I’m looking at things we should be talking about: the future, climate change, the population, almost a cataclysm that has wiped out humanity,” he says. “I don’t think anything can be innocent any more. It is drawing an explicit comparison between societal upheaval and moments of disorder, moments of dishevel and the current moment.”It all started when the museum invited Cole to peruse their archive of over 15,000 photos, which ranges from a young Aretha Franklin in a recording studio in 1960 to works by young Ethiopian photographer Aida Muluneh.“They invited me to interpret their archive through a selection,” he says. “They’re interested in how different people can see what is here.”The oldest work in the exhibit is from 1864, a photo by George N Barnard – an early user of the daguerreotype – for a photo called the Battle Field of Atlanta, Georgia, No 1, which shows a landscape ravaged by the American civil war. It’s part of Barnard’s time where he worked as the official army photographer for the Mississippi military (he also captured Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration in 1861).However, most of the work is from 1920 to the present, including works by the depression-era American photographer Dorothea Lange, where Cole has selected a shot of a woman’s legs wearing torn pantyhose, sewn together.“Working during the Great Depression has so much to say to us right in this minute she took amazing photos in the 1930s to show how the state failed its children and how the government failed the citizens of its state,” Cole says. “It is unfortunately too familiar in photographic space.”But is it a political exhibition? “It’s hard for me to do anything these days without it having some kind of political energy throbbing behind it. For me, nothing is absent of politics.”The exhibit also features works by Melissa Ann Pinney, a photographer known for capturing girlhood, who took intimate shots from a hairdressing school in 1987, while Zora J Murff, who creates portraits shot in black neighborhoods, details how one Nebraska town has prejudicial housing policies.There’s also a photo by Kerry Coppin, who shot African American neighborhoods in Chicago throughout the 1980s. Coppin once said of his work: “My photographs are interpretations, testaments, and poems. They are indictments! Not the first, nor the last, in an ongoing debate – the means by which people of African descent will restore our histories and cultures to their rightful place in the world community.”This exhibition is described as a “poem of contemporary America, exploring elemental themes of movement, chaos, freedom, and hope”.That’s broad territory, but Cole explains: “There’s a lot of mayhem in this show, a lot of melancholy moments of tension. One of the questions the exhibit asks is: what is hope when it’s not naive? Hope can be very much an embodied thing. It’s something that occurs fleetingly, but there’s power when it occurs.”He adds: “It attempts to say something about our collective predicaments as human beings. It deals a lot with the American experience.”The photos are not all American. They do, however, reflect upon the consequences of failed decision-making, and look at human suffering with hope, suggesting that a glint of optimism is still possible in contemporary America.“I’m pessimistic and hopeful,” Cole says. “The facts indicate we’re all in a very hard time. It’s about not giving up. After all, we know things change.”He adds: “This is about those who are tired offering something to those who are exhausted. There are degrees of this I am so tired, and yet I know that there are people who have it much worse. So hope, in that sense, feels like a responsibility.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61392508e2651c63cb69909a4ce04719ade89cc0/0_505_7579_4548/master/7579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d02c01c6bae15e81ca1db41bc295aa6f","title":"seaside photographed exhibition turner contemporary margate photography","story":"From Victorian days out to 21st-century staycations, our coastal resorts are an enduring attraction.

For a start there’s the wonderful isolation, the feeling of relaxing remoteness, the total absence of bustling city commuters. Picture tropical palm trees waving above pristine white beaches, lapped by sparkling turquoise seas. Whatever the reason, everyone loves an island. People go to Rottnest in Western Australia to admire the quokkas, to Norfolk Island to soak up the fascinating history and bucolic scenery, and to Christmas Island for the red crab migration.I am a twitcher and for me it’s always the birds. I go to Rottnest for terns, waders and red-capped robins, to Norfolk for parakeets, gerygones and California quail, and to Christmas Island for Abbott’s boobies, frigatebirds and rare vagrants. I’ve seen some fantastic vagrants (birds outside their usual range) on my five visits to Christmas Island. Apart from all the exciting endemics (birds that are unique to one place), I’ve seen 12 extraordinary vagrants, including such rarities as a red collared dove, a Malayan night heron and, best of all, a corn crake.Vagrants on Cocos Island are even better. Today you can rely on seeing Saunders’ terns and white-breasted waterhens. This wasn’t always the case, but now they are reliably seen. As well as these dependable favourites, there are often some very rare birds on Cocos. In recent years I’ve seen several, including such gems as Von Schrenk’s bittern, drongo-cuckoo, black-crowned night heron and tree pipit.Some islands are famous for special species, such as little penguins on Phillip Island in Victoria’s Western Port Bay or Lord Howe woodhen (naturally) on Lord Howe. Then there are herald petrels on Raine Island in far north Queensland, and Gould’s petrels on Cabbage Tree Island in New South Wales.These last mentioned seabirds have an enthralling story to tell – a little known conservation success. Gould’s petrel is the only NSW bird to have a downgraded conservation status. It used to be endangered, but thanks to a lot of hard work by dedicated ornithologists and volunteers it has now been listed as vulnerable.I visited 22 islands researching my new book, and each is special in its own way.Islands are usually tranquil and relaxing, but seeing a mega rarity is always exciting. Sometimes I have to remind myself to breathe.In many cases getting there is half the fun, but visiting Macquarie Island is more of an intrepid adventure than a luxury ocean cruise. On the other hand, when you visit Ashmore Reef off northern Western Australia or Boigu Island in the Torres Strait, getting there is an experience in itself. These places don’t feel like Australia at all.Going to Macquarie may be difficult, but birders must go there, no matter how daunted they feel. How else can they get imperial shags onto their list? To say nothing of several species of penguins, Antarctic terns and redpolls.The bird that I’ve seen most on my island adventures is the sacred kingfisher. These lovely birds with their pleasing and recognisable call are common everywhere from Norfolk Island to Ashmore Reef, from Rottnest to Bedarra.They’re even present on the one inland island in my book – an artificial island created when the Ord River was dammed to make Lake Argyle in the 1970s. I don’t believe this island has an official name, but it is locally dubbed Chat island because there are so many yellow chats there.When I visited, it was a birder’s paradise. We drew up a phenomenal birdlist including Australian bustard, long-toed stint, reeve, little curlew, red-winged parrot and (always a favourite) rainbow bee-eater.These gorgeous birds, which I enjoy every summer in my home state of Victoria, also feature on Bedarra in northern Queensland, Ashmore Reef off Western Australia and in the Torres Strait, where we watched them migrating to New Guinea.On Three Hummock Island off Tasmania I admired hooded dotterels and the Tasmanian race of wedge-tailed eagles. Both these species are classified as vulnerable.And often I find something unexpected. Did you know that fairy prions breed on King Island? That bush stone-curlews on Kangaroo Island are smaller than on the mainland? That red-capped robins on Rottnest have a different call from their mainland mates?Birding is my passion and I love doing it wherever I am. But birding on islands is always very special. Rarities are exciting wherever they turn up, but I appreciate our most common birds too, such as rainbow bee-eaters and eastern spinebills. Perhaps it’s the effort you put into getting to an island. Perhaps it’s the isolation.

However. it has said it will not set dates until after further talks with the airline, which intends to take its case to the court of appeal.Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “Although legally clear to do so, we have still not set any strike dates to give BA one last chance to commit to negotiating on pilots pay and rewards with us at Acas later this week.”He added: “The company itself has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what our pilots are asking for, so the ball really is in their court here, to look after their pilots and ensure the hardworking public get to continue their holidays as planned.”A BA spokesman said the airline remained open to talks, adding: “We are very disappointed with today’s decision. We will continue to pursue every avenue to protect the holidays of thousands of our customers this summer.”Pilots had sought an above-inflation pay settlement that would also include a profit share scheme, reflecting their argument that they took pay cuts when BA was struggling in the wake of the financial crisis and that they should share in the benefit now that the business has recovered.

But major companies have started to abandon it and set up their own in-house imitations – threatening the very idea of fair trade. It wasn’t very long ago that a banana was just a banana – just a curved, yellow fruit. All you knew, if you bought a bunch in 1986, was that they cost around 97p per kilo. You weren’t told if they were organic or pesticide-free. You didn’t know if they came from Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic. And you certainly weren’t invited to worry about the farmers who grew them – or if their children went to school, or whether their villages had clinics. You just picked up your bananas and walked to the next aisle for your coffee or tea or chocolate, none the wiser about where they came from either, or about the people who farmed them.Back then, the countries that grew these commodities and many others were still known as the Third World, and the habit of not caring about their farming conditions was a legacy of their colonial past. For centuries, trade propelled the colonial project, and exploitation was its very purpose. The farmers of Asia, Africa and South America were forced to raise the crops that the empire’s companies wanted, to work the crops in abject conditions, and to part with them at ruinously low prices. In the last century, the empires melted away but the trade remained lopsided – with the imbalance now rationalised by the market, which deemed it “efficient” to pay farmers as little as possible. In the 1970s, a Ghanaian cocoa farmer often received less than 10 cents out of every dollar his beans earned on the commodities market as a proportion of the retail price of a chocolate bar, his take was smaller still. Child labour was common. The chocolate companies prospered and their customers shopped well the farmers stayed poor.Then, in the late 1980s, you began to hear more about these farmers, encountering their stories on television or in newspapers or even on the labels of the packages you bought. The reasons were manifold. Environmental awareness was on the rise. The prices of some commodities were crashing, placing agricultural incomes in even more acute peril than usual. There had already been small groups pushing for more equitable trade: “little do-good shops scattered in cities around Europe, selling products … bought at fair prices directly from small producers abroad”, as one pioneer described it. By the early 1990s, these disparate initiatives began to coalesce into a larger international struggle to radically reform our relationship with what we bought. Trade had long been unfair by design, but now there was a growing movement to make consumers care about that unfairness, and even to help rectify it.The crown jewel of this movement was Fairtrade International, an umbrella body formed in 1997 out of various national chapters that had sprouted over the previous decade. Fairtrade was founded on the conviction that consumers could make the marketplace more moral. The spine of Fairtrade’s philosophy has always been price: simple, clean, the kind of measure that economists like to deal with. If companies pay farmers equitably, Fairtrade believes, other benefits cascade out as well. Farmers can hire adult workers, rather than employing children they can send their kids to school, and buy medicines they can improve the yields of their farms by using better fertilisers. Producers must meet a number of standards to qualify for Fairtrade: rules about labour conditions, for instance, or waste disposal. But for companies, the totality of their ethical responsibilities towards their producers is encapsulated by price.So Fairtrade works by forming a kind of “virtuous triangle” of ethical business. It recruits farmers and farming cooperatives as members, asking them to meet its standards periodically, Fairtrade sends inspectors to these farms around the world, ensuring they are still compliant. At another vertex of the triangle, Fairtrade enlists companies to pay a minimum price, always set above market price, for commodities from these member farms, and offers to certify products made from such ethically sourced commodities. The final corner is the customer, who can, with a little counsel, be galvanised to shop consciously, and to buy Fairtrade-certified products even if they cost a few pence more.But its two real triumphs are in the realm of ideas, not numbers. First, and most obviously, Fairtrade challenged the entrenched model of the commodities business – the belief that a farmer’s lean income was just an unavoidable reality of trade economics. Second, somewhat more stealthily, it cemented the notion that the modern corporation would be ethical if only someone held up a lamp and showed it the way. Capitalism didn’t have to be feared the market would figure out its own checks and balances, through labelling agencies such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, without having to be regulated by any higher authority. Persistent and egregious inequality could be solved by deft pleats and tucks to the garb of trade, rather than by a full reconsideration of its fabric and seams.Now, though, Fairtrade’s success in helping to build a world of heightened expectations of sustainability is perversely paving the way to its own demise. Companies are losing faith in labels such as Fairtrade – losing faith in their ability to secure the future of farming and the future of commodities that drive corporate profit, but also losing faith that these independent stamps of sustainability carry any value at all any more. Instead, the world’s giant food multinationals are taking matters into their own hands – setting up their own in-house certification programmes, appraising their own ethics to their own satisfaction.Although the fate of Fairtrade is not necessarily the fate of fair trade, the former has kept the latter alive as an object of aspiration. A weakened Fairtrade portends the enfeebling of the very idea of fair trade. This poses a serious problem, because Fairtrade relies on companies to constitute one half of its virtuous bazaar. Without the buyers, the Fairtrade bazaar folds up, and companies return to their own devices, to pursue only what’s best for themselves. Increasingly, companies are finding it easier and more expedient to produce their own certifications, said Trishna Shah, a Euromonitor analyst who tracks ethical labels: “A big change is happening.”The single most damaging blow to Fairtrade came two summers ago, and it was delivered by Sainsbury’s, which once proudly boasted that it was the world’s largest retailer of Fairtrade products. In May 2017, without any warning, Sainsbury’s broke the news that it would stop selling Fairtrade tea.“It was a bombshell,” Paul Tiony said. He had travelled to Nairobi that month, from his tea farm in Nandi Hills, in western Kenya, to take part in a half-day workshop run by Fairtrade Africa. Other tea farmers, from Malawi, Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, were there as well, at the Pride Westlands hotel so was a team from Sainsbury’s. The company called a meeting at the end of the workshop, and Tiony grew excited. Sainsbury’s must have some kind of good news, he thought. But after gathering almost 50 workshop participants in a conference room of the hotel, Sainsbury’s revealed that its in-house tea brands were abandoning Fairtrade. Instead, an executive said, it was piloting its own ethical label – and calling it “Fairly Traded”. Later, Fairtrade estimated that these changes would affect nearly 250,000 farmers and workers.Among these were the 8,000 members of Sireet, the tea-farming cooperative to which Tiony belongs. Sireet’s produce is certified by Fairtrade, and Sainsbury’s used to be, by far, the largest buyer of Sireet’s Fairtrade tea. So Tiony was dumbstruck at the shock announcement. “Even Fairtrade Africa officials didn’t seem to know much about it,” he recalled. “They were asking: ‘Why are you doing this?’” Someone inquired: “Are you moving out of Fairtrade because of Brexit?”Sainsbury’s had no real answers, Tiony said – but it seemed to be doubting that Fairtrade was working as promised. One Sainsbury’s executive singled out one of the central principles of Fairtrade’s model: the so-called “premium” above the minimum price that companies must pay, and which cooperatives must use to build schools, or run clinics, or improve their communities in other ways. Sainsbury’s was concerned that the premium was being poorly used, and that it was money wasted. “But just a few days earlier,” Tiony said, “someone from Sainsbury’s had come to look at all our projects.” The farmers tried to argue with the executives the executives insisted they weren’t going to change their minds. “The meeting ended just like that.” The announcement kicked off an immediate storm. In an open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers in Africa accused Sainsbury’s of seeking “power and control” over farmers in a manner “reminiscent of colonial rule”. A coalition of British non-profits urged consumers into a weekend of action under the rubric: “Don’t Ditch Fairtrade”. Buy a pack of “Fairly Traded” tea and then give it back, they suggested: “Let the sales assistant know you are returning it because it’s not Fairtrade.” In Parliament, MPs pressed Sainsbury’s to reconsider one accused the company of lying, and another complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that the name Fairly Traded would mislead shoppers who confused it for Fairtrade. (Sainsbury’s declined to comment for this story. “The launch of Fairly Traded was a bit of a disaster,” a former executive told me with a sigh.)The Fairly Traded experiment ignited fears of a full orce, in which Sainsbury’s would abandon the rest of its Fairtrade products – its coffee and sugar its flowers the 650m bananas it sells every year – and move out of the Fairtrade house altogether. That would, the  wrote at the time, bring Fairtrade “crashing down”. So far, this hasn’t happened, but Sainsbury’s is still only a couple of years into its experiment with Fairly Traded. The orce could still come.All these firms still have a few products that are certified by third parties – by Fairtrade, or by other agencies such as Rainforest Alliance or UTZ. (The latter two merged in January 2018.) But the ratio is dwindling. The great energies of these corporations, said Trishna Shah, the Euromonitor analyst, are being lavished upon their own, bespoke schemes – each with its own little logo, its own definition of fairness, its own explanatory literature on a web page somewhere.For shoppers, this promises bewildering times ahead at the supermarket: more and more instances of what people in the industry call “label fatigue”. The shelves already crawl with sustainability logos: more than 460 of them on food and beverage packages, and a third of them created over the last 15 years. There are little chromatic decals to testify that tuna is dolphin-friendly that coffee is bird-friendly that “wild-collected natural ingredients” are up to FairWild standards that a slice of salmon is Salmon-Safe and follows Best Aquaculture Practices that a bottle of wine is LIVE, which means that it fulfills Low Input Viticulture and Ecology benchmarks. One logo promises a carbon-free product, another a carbon-neutral one, and a third a carbon-reducing one. The more labels there are, the less we know about them – about what they stand for, and about how meaningful they are.In a crowd, there’s room to hide. When Fairtrade began, labels were rare and precious things when you bought a product with a label on it, you knew what you were getting. In contrast, a company today can launch its certification logo into the large ocean of labels, confident that most shoppers will not know what the logo guarantees, but that it will nonetheless salve their consciences. “I think companies are hoping that label fatigue is an enduring trend,” said Elizabeth Bennett, a political economist who co-edited the Handbook of Research on Fair Trade. “They’re hoping that consumers are tired of learning what 30 different labels in one sector mean, and that we’ll all just think: ‘Any claim of sustainability is an improvement over no claim.’” This makes it easy for companies to resort to the ruse of “greenwashing” – pretending to be ethical without really being anything of the sort.Several people in the corporate world offered an even more depressing version of this story: companies are sidling away from third-party certifiers because their optimistic project – the idea that the market can be heedful of its own abuses and correct itself – has, in a grand sense, failed. After decades of work, these certifiers have been unable to truly alter the imbalance in global trade they have struggled to protect farmers, or to arm them for their various social, economic and environmental battles.The proof is in the dire projections for the future of farming, showing how vanishing agricultural bioersity, the warming climate and the ageing and impoverishment of farmers are all endangering the world’s crops – which means they are also endangering the supply chains of companies who rely upon farmers in Asia, Africa and Latin America to manufacture chocolate bars, coffee pods, or cotton T-shirts. By launching all these in-house programmes, companies are trying to take matters into their own hands – if only to secure their sources of commodities, and their bottom lines.The Fairtrade movement was born in 1988, when a Dutch non-profit introduced the first certification for ethically traded coffee. The label was named Max Havelaar, after a seminal anti-colonial novel by the Dutch writer Eduard Dekker, published in 1860. In the novel, Dekker described how the Dutch in Indonesia, having made themselves “masters of the country”, compelled the Javanese farmer to grow sugar and coffee, instead of rice for his family. The government “punishes him if he sells what he has produced to any purchaser but itself and it fixes the price actually paid”, Dekker wrote. “And because the entire trade must produce profit, that profit cannot be got in any other way than by paying the Javanese just enough to keep him from starving.” Naming the label after the novel was a blunt acknowledgement of the straight line connecting colonial exploitation to corporate exploitation. When the label launched, three Dutch coffee brands signed on to source their beans from a farmers’ cooperative in Mexico, paying a rate above market price that was agreed to be fair. The following year, coffee prices crashed following a breakdown of trade talks: the cost of a pound of coffee on the commodities market fell to rates last seen in the 1930s. Coffee farmers faced ruin. The universe seemed to be emphasising the urgency of Max Havelaar’s mission.In the voluminous literature on its website, Fairtrade sets out the prices it calculates to be “fair”. As of mid-July, the minimum price for a metric tonne of cocoa beans was $2,000 for a kilo of bananas from Cameroon, €6.40 for 1,000 fresh coconuts from the Windward Islands, $112. But Fairtrade doesn’t stop with ensuring these minimum prices it also demands that producers be paid an extra premium – $11 for the Windward Islands coconuts, for instance – and that these premiums be spent to benefit the community.Fairtrade insists that producers make these investment decisions democratically, which means that farmers have to organise into collectives such as Sireet. There is an undeniable power in Fairtrade bringing these collectives to the negotiating table, said Pauline Tiffen, the editor of the Journal of Fair Trade. “The tea industry used to be so hierarchical until quite recently that it was like something out of Dickens,” she said. “And cocoa still felt like it was operating in the 18th century. Until 20 years ago, if you went to any big trade meetings on cocoa, you’d see no women, no people of colour.”The debate over whether Fairtrade’s systems truly transform the lives of farmers has raged for nearly all of Fairtrade’s lifetime. Its numbers, in relative terms, are still puny. The 1.66 million farmers in the Fairtrade network form a speck within the 2 billion or so people who make their living from agriculture. The sale value of Fairtrade’s products may add up to $9bn, but the global market for coffee alone is worth $200bn.Even the benefits that Fairtrade promises to deliver to farmers have been called into question. In 2014, Fairtrade entered into a public squabble with a team from Soas University of London, which had examined how well Fairtrade did in shrinking poverty in Ethiopia and Uganda. The study, funded by the British government, found that schoolchildren had worked on Fairtrade-certified farms. The researchers compared wages on Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee estates – always owned by smallholders, in keeping with Fairtrade’s belief in championing the small farmer – with wages on larger, uncertified plantations. Workers on the Fairtrade estates were paid less and often laboured in worse conditions, they concluded. Fairtrade called these “distorted comparisons” and rejected the researchers’ conclusions.The rupture between Sainsbury’s and Fairtrade over tea has become the most prominent case of a large company concluding that Fairtrade wasn’t quite cutting it any more. The details of that rupture convey why Sainsbury’s was dissatisfied with Fairtrade, but also why replacement corporate schemes such as Fairly Traded feel flimsy or stifling to those meant to benefit from them.Two people who have worked with Sainsbury’s told me that the company had been unhappy with Fairtrade for years. When I spoke to these anonymous sources in April, both sounded exasperated at the way Sainsbury’s had handled its exit, but they made the case that its reasons were sound. “We were paying these premiums, but it wasn’t clear where the money was going. Fairtrade isn’t good at keeping tabs on it,” one of them said. “It wasn’t always going to medicines and schools and things like that, as we found through our own investigations.”Other Fairtrade partners had raised this as well, she added. “We wanted more data … Instead, there was just a systemic inefficiency.” Sainsbury’s, as a corporation, was constantly pressured to be transparent, she said. “But it turned out that Fairtrade wasn’t quite as transparent. That was frustrating.” The other Sainsbury’s source confirmed this. “If you wanted to find out what a cooperative had done with a whole wad of Fairtrade premiums, or what the impact of that had been over the years, nobody could tell you. Or you’d get some anecdotal stuff.”A Fairtrade spokesperson told me, in response to these claims, that the organisation wanted farmers to spend their premiums the way they wished, setting their own goals and monitoring their own progress. She added that, since April, Fairtrade has “strengthened the requirements on Fairtrade premium use, management, and reporting, in order to promote best practices and increase transparency”. Now, if a cooperative’s annual premiums exceed $150,000, it must hire an external auditor to inspect the way it accounts for the money.Even as Sainsbury’s was stewing over the premiums it was paying out, the second Sainsbury’s source told me, it had begun to “rain down with standards” over the past decade. Companies and non-profits introduced a fleet of new labels and certifications, their names all seeming to blend hazily into each other. Pasture for Life. New Forest Marque. Food Made Good. Soil Association. Free Range Dairy Pasture Promise. LEAF Marque. “Then Fairtrade starts to look just like a sliver of the pie – an expensive and not very satisfactory one,” said the source. “And Sainsbury’s thinks: ‘I’m sure we can do this ourselves, I’m sure we know what needs to be delivered.’”Fairtrade didn’t think so. Under Fairly Traded, farmer collectives no longer receive their premiums directly, or decide how to spend this money. Instead, they must work on “action plans” and convince a Sainsbury’s board of experts in London to release their funds. In their open letter, Fairtrade’s tea producers protested that the company was characterising these premiums as “donor money” rather than earnings that rightfully belonged to the farmers. Fairtrade called the board “a further layer of bureaucracy controlled by a group far removed from day-to-day life in Africa”.It feels like a paradox: that, in a moment when sustainability and ethics are more important than ever, corporations want to desert an agency such as Fairtrade, the most famous certifying entity in the field. Companies are under pressure – from customers, governments, banks and investors – to prove their sustainability credentials. Signatories to the UN’s Principles of Responsible Investment now manage around $89tn in assets. The network of Sustainable Stock Exchanges – more than 80 bourses around the world – guide and sometimes even require listed companies to report on their sustainability.In a way, this dialled-up consciousness explains why companies are searching for alternatives to independent labelling systems, said Fredrik Galtung, who runs TrueFootprint, a firm that analyses data to tell businesses if their various sustainability projects make any sort of impact. He detects, in the industries he works with, a hardnosed sense that unsustainable practices will result in economic risk. So he isn’t surprised that companies, finding Fairtrade insufficient at tackling that risk, are rushing to erect their own standards. “If Fairtrade producers could show that their farmers were 10 or 20 years younger on average, that would be something. If they could show they’re more climate-resistant, that would be a massive advantage. But we’re unable to see all this.”Fairtrade denies that its future is dim, or that a schism has appeared between itself and the companies with which it aims to work. In his discussions of these issues, Dario Soto Abril, who has been the CEO of Fairtrade International since 2016, is a model of genial tact. He’s in an unenviable position. He must keep his relations with corporations warm Sainsbury’s still retails plenty of Fairtrade-labelled products, for example, and Mondelēz uses Fairtrade’s skills to track payments and commodities up and down the supply chain. At the same time, Soto must project his conviction that it is best for everyone concerned – shoppers, farmers, but especially companies – if they all commit fully to Fairtrade.The effects of climate change alone are “so accelerated”, Soto said, “that we think if nothing of significance is done by 2050, at least half the land under coffee production now will be lost, one way or another.”Last year, the UN released a map of the world predicting where yields were likely to drop or rise before 2050. In West Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, which have been plantation-farmed by colonists and then corporations, harvests will shrink. In North America and Europe, which have already cornered the profits of centuries of agribusiness, harvests will expand. The map is iniquity compounded upon iniquity.Soto insists Fairtrade is flourishing: “Our credibility remains high. We get new partners all the time.” Sales of Fairtrade-certified products have swelled year on year around the world, partly as a result of companies exploring new markets. On the other hand, farmers are entering Fairtrade at a slowing pace. Between 2015 and 2016, Fairtrade managed to bring 3,199 new workers into its network the previous year, it recruited 9,955.“It’s important to note that Fairtrade can’t solve everything,” Soto said. “We’re here trying to solve challenges as old as humanity. We need more committed partners. We need more innovative ideas.” But Soto is also forgiving of companies that have chosen to set up schemes to certify themselves. “I think companies are looking to test something new,” he said carefully. “We need to allow for that. I will never doubt that companies will do the best they can.”For the chief executive of an organisation founded on the premise that companies need to be cajoled or nagged into paying farmers a living income, this sounded like an astonishingly trusting statement. Soto’s most barbed opinion concerned farmer premiums and the larger issue of involving producers in decision-making. “I’m with you when you say that these companies aren’t giving farmers a seat at the table,” Soto told me. “You have to allow farmers a say in the income generated by sales. They have to own their premiums. That was our biggest suggestion to Sainsbury’s.”Last October, the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK acknowledged that, in the new era of self-certification, its function had to evolve. Since companies are setting up their own sustainability schemes, said Lord Mark Price, who chairs the Foundation’s board of trustees, “the role of Fairtrade is to help those organisations be the best they can be”. Fairtrade will still operate its certification programme the yin-yang logo will still be seen on products. But for Fairtrade to climb into the role of a consultancy – a supplier of guidance, rather than an umpire enforcing a line for companies to toe – is the most conclusive evidence yet of the transformation under way. And it raises two questions. How will companies behave if they have to testify only to their own code of ethical sourcing? And in what shape will that leave the future of agriculture?If the animating principle of Fairtrade is “price,” that of most corporate in-house programmes is “yield”. These programmes may differ in other details. Some are just two years old others were established more than a decade ago. Some pay their farmers Fairtrade-like minimum prices others do not. But they are united by their unwavering focus on yield – on squeezing more produce out of a hectare of land. They consider it the best way to protect and grow their supplies of coffee or tea or cocoa, and thus the best way to save agriculture.Mondelēz also does not set a minimum price. It pays “loyalty premiums” to the farmer collectives with which it chooses to work, and Cathy Pieters, director of Mondelēz’s Cocoa Life programme, said it was up to them to decide what kind of “action plans” can be funded with the money. She added, though, that Mondelēz commissions large NGOs to work with these cooperatives in determining and crafting these action plans. Once again, as with Sainsbury’s and its Fairly Traded programme, the premiums intended to benefit farmers aren’t quite wholly theirs to spend as they see fit.Fairtrade is half-owned by its producer cooperatives, so its standards and metrics are decided in large part by the representatives of farmers. The standards of Cocoa Life, CAFE Practices and other schemes aren’t like that they are written by the companies themselves, in the companies’ own best interests. No independent third party certifies their success or failure in meeting these standards and publishes those results. Companies reporting on their own sustainability frequently fail “to prioritise planet over profit”, Hans Hoogervorst, who heads the International Accounting Standards Board, said in a speech in April. “Greenwashing is rampant.”Industries are increasingly left to audit themselves, in part because governments have shredded their budgets in the name of austerity. From Volkswagen to Boeing, we don’t have to look very hard for evidence that companies fib and cheat when they get to mark their own homework. Bringing sustainability certification in-house is unlikely to empower farmers, or to renovate the structure of trade. “But it’s simplistic to say that companies will act in ways that are injurious to farmers,” said Fredrik Galtung of TrueFootprint, the sustainability analysts. In his view, the crises in agriculture are so stark that companies are motivated to protect farms and farm workers – if only to secure their own future profits. But TrueFootprint’s scorecards indicate that most companies only report their spending on sustainability almost none of them investigate the impact of these schemes on farmers or on natural resources like air and water. Galtung described it as “just being happy to check off boxes”.That lesson is available to students of the past as well. After the publication of Max Havelaar shocked the public, in 1901 the Dutch government formulated a new ethical policy – one that would treat Indonesia as a moral responsibility rather than simply as a territory to be exploited. Millions of guilders had flowed from these islands into the Dutch treasury – 187m between 1867 and 1878 alone – and so the government committed to spending 30m guilders over the first decade on the welfare of the Indies’ farmers. Not surprisingly, they received agricultural credit and irrigation canals, because the Dutch corporations were avid for better yields. They also gained more schools and more roads they were not, however, encouraged to industrialise, because this would have inflated the cost of local labour and led to competition with Dutch businesses.The Dutch ethical policy came undone as soon as the colonist’s aims started to clash with those of the colony. The harvests improved, but not enough to warrant the investment. The Great Depression set in, and the government thinned down its expenditures even as Indonesian farmers slid into debt. Educating the populace began to seem like a mistake there was no work for young Indonesian men who had attended university, and they inevitably drifted into the nationalist movement. By 1940, the government had ceased to fund the welfare projects.An unnamed administrator, who had once supported the ethical policy, watched with disappointment as the meagre progress unravelled and said: “As soon as we withdraw our hands, everything sinks back into the marsh.” But what the Dutch didn’t recognise was that they were the ones who made it impossible for the Indonesians to rise from the marsh in the first place.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001db16bad59597cc9e5758839bfd56eb93f5226/0_83_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad3942483d22ebeabbcb13672e0d2b8","title":"lets face it nuclear power is hideously dear and far from ideal","story":"The government should be backing renewables, not tying itself to an expensive nuclear futureThat bill-payers got stuffed in the deal that brought the Hinkley Point C project into existence is beyond dispute these days. Even government ministers barely quibble with the National Audit Office’s assessment that consumers will be paying through the nose for 35 years. Instead, the defence has tended to run along these lines: don’t worry, we’ve triggered a “resurgence” in the nuclear industry in the UK and the next reactors will be relative bargains.Life has not worked out as planned. The government stretched the limits of financial acceptability to try to persuade Hitachi to construct a £16bn plant at Wylfa in Anglesey but still couldn’t get the Japanese firm to sign up. Nuclear still wasn’t getting cheaper. No surprise there: the costs never seem to fall.Now here’s the government’s latest effort to resurrect the show – “an innovative funding model”. Of course, it’s not really innovative. The “regulated asset base” (RAB) approach, which could be used at Sizewell B in Suffolk, and is intended to copy the design of Hinkley, is common in other parts of the utility world.Think of the RAB method as an attempt to knock the sharp edges off the financial arrangements at Hinkley. At the Somerset plant, the developer, EDF, carries the risks of cost overruns but is allowed to charge sky-high guaranteed prices for the output when the plant is up and running. Under RAB, consumers would start to pay for a plant before it is built but the electricity at the end should be cheaper. For their part, investors get a lower, but safer, regulated return.Genius? Not really. Aside from exposing consumers to the cost of overruns, RAB in effect also requires them to provide financing at zero interest, a point made by the National Infrastructure Commission last year. Little wonder, then, that the juice should be cheaper than Hinkley’s – some of the costs will be hidden from view.But is RAB an improvement? Possibly. At least you get some competition among outside investors to provide capital, which may trim a few costs. And, by the time Sizewell could be commissioned in 2021, EDF should have completed its second plant in China. So we may be better able to judge whether the French state-backed firm has learned from its wretched experience in Normandy, where the Flamanville plant bust every budget and still isn’t generating.So, yes, the RAB model is worth a consultation. But let’s not get carried away. First, as the same NIC report said: “There is limited experience of using the RAB model for anything as complex and risky as nuclear.” Second, no financing model can disguise the core truth about nuclear – the technology is hideously expensive.The NIC said last year that the UK shouldn’t rush to tie itself to an expensive nuclear future and should instead back renewables, notably wind and solar, to continue becoming cheaper. Even after recognising the need to have secure “baseload” supplies, it recommended commissioning only one more nuclear plant, on top of Hinkley, before 2025. That remains a commonsense analysis. Renewables are winning the price race.Let us pray, then, that a love-in with RAB does not reignite ministerial fantasies about a “resurgence” in nuclear. We don’t want a resurgence. We want to build as few new reactors as possible.Only a month ago, banknote printer De La Rue looked a takeover target in the making. Its chief executive, Martin Sutherland, had said he’d quit after a profits warning. Then the chairman, Philip Rogerson, said he wanted to retire, to be followed by Andy Stevens, the senior independent director. In the wings, an activist investor, Crystal Amber, was trying to fill the vacuum by stirring up bidders.It’s time, though, to revisit the takeover thesis. Nothing deadens appetites like a Serious Fraud Office inquiry, which is what De La Rue has now got. The SFO has launched a probe into “suspected corruption” in the group’s conduct of business in South Sudan.Still, Rogerson has an early opportunity to reveal how he will execute his “orderly” succession plan because the annual meeting of shareholders takes place on Thursday. The gathering may be lively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39947967d35c92581b24e984c7eda4d1d5925da8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b0c8aa86ddf3863f035b19ca033e987","title":"the jungle metropolis how sprawling manaus is eating into the amazon","story":"Informal settlements are expanding, with a new occupation attempt every 11 days, and the threat to the rainforest is severeAntonio Pinto’s makeshift home on the outskirts of Manaus is an open-air shack, one of dozens of similar dwellings of timber and tarpaulin scattered around the hills.Around them is the evidence of the use of flame and iron: the hills are scorched and brown, littered with fallen logs and toppled, twisted trees.Pinto, 57, moved here earlier this year from an isolated Amazonian river town, 18 hours away by boat. He’s sick and needed to be closer to a hospital to get regular treatment.“I’m indio,” he said, meaning indigenous. “There’s a bunch of indigenous people here.”Not long ago, this area was covered in pristine Amazon rainforest and native shrubbery. In 2015, a group arrived and began clearing the land using chainsaws and fire. Today the settlement is known as Monte Horebe, and is home to about 5,000 people.It is the largest of dozens of shantytowns in this jungle metropolis, population 2 million. Dubbed “invasions”, these informal settlements are expanding outwards into the forest: in 2018 authorities identified a new occupation attempt every 11 days on average.“Manaus should be an example to the world of how man and nature can live together, but unfortunately that’s not the case,” said Marcos Castro, a professor at the Federal University of Amazonas.Critics say the clearances are also the result of a government failure to address a chronic shortage of affordable housing. As the economic powerhouse of the Brazilian Amazon, Manaus attracts thousands of migrants each year.Many of the poorest end up in informal housing such as Monte Horebe. According to the Manaus environment secretariat, at least 100 football pitch-sized patches of forest and vegetation have been destroyed to make space for squatters to build homes. Monte Horebe borders the Adolpho Ducke reserve, one of Brazil’s largest preserved urban forests.The trees are not the only concern, however, said the city’s environment secretary, Antonio Nelson de Oliveira. “Deforestation is, of course, bad, but it can be resolved by planting more trees. Cleaning polluted waters is a lot more complex,” he said.Untreated waste and rubbish from the occupations usually ends up in Manaus’s hundreds of igarapés – little rivers – that snake across the city. Today, all are polluted.“As a kid, I used to swim in the igarapés. That’s impossible now,” said the mayor, Arthur Virgilio Neto.Igarapés flow into the Rio Negro, the city’s main river and primary water supply. The smaller tributaries are important for maintaining healthy soils, and if blocked can lead to serious flooding during rainy seasons.Nevertheless, migration continues to increase, recently fed by new groups of Haitians and Venezuelans fleeing civil strife. Manaus is the capital of Amazonas state, a vast area more than five times the size of Germany that is home to the world’s largest remaining tropical forest reserves.In the interior towns, however, jobs are scarce and traditional ways of life such as fishing and family farming are becoming more difficult. Public services, schools and hospitals are often far away.But housing in Manaus proper is expensive and in scarce supply, leading many people to build their own informal accommodation on the forest’s edge.Sebastiana Cruz, 43, who works in a shopping mall, came here to escape expensive rent in 2015. She says the housing deficit feels unaddressed. “The mayor never visited,” she said. “Politicians only come when they want votes.”According to Brazil’s Institute of Geography and Statistics, Manaus needs an additional 128,000 homes. The deficit takes into account currently existing stock that is substandard or unaffordable, but also the need for more housing overall.“You could fix much of the irregular occupations problem by building more low-income housing,” said Virgilio Viana, CEO of the Sustainable Amazon Foundation.Complicating matters, local government authorities said occupations are typically led by organised crime groups. Monte Horebe is controlled by the city’s most powerful drug gang, the Northern Family, which was was recently accused of ordering a bloody prison massacre that killed dozens. The group controls large swathes of the city“Today, the force of the invasions is much stronger than the forces to protect against them,” De Oliveira said, arguing that security and combating crime should be first priority.Castro argued that the problems are symptomatic of successive government failures. “It’s easy to blame drug traffickers and poor people,” he said. “But this is a long-term problem.”Manaus itself was built largely informally. In the 1970s the city’s population began to swell with the opening of a free trade zone that was home to thousands of factory jobs.“But the government was unable to cope with the demand,” said Castro.He emphasised that while squatter communities like Monte Horebe indeed cause enormous environmental damage, luxury condominiums and factories also dump waste into rivers, and noted that the vast majority water in Manaus goes untreated.Many believe the situation can only get worse. One factor cited is a plan to reopen the dilapidated highway connecting the Manaus to Porto Velho. Currently, Manaus is mostly only accessible by plane or boat the 870km highway fell into disrepair decades ago. Now the authorities have signalled that they plan to reopen it, many fear Manaus’ migration and housing crisis will be aggravated, leading to more occupations.“The fact that Manaus is isolated kept people out to a certain extent,” said Philip Fearnside, an American biologist who has lived in Manaus since the 1970s.The extreme weather effects of the climate crisis are also only likely to exacerbate the environmental degradation, Viana pointed out.“It’s an extremely worrying scenario,” he said.Additional reporting by Fábio OliveiraFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0a23943b1efde3721d382ea2a25273b6855493/0_0_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906f1ed16f7b3420b02384cb61b2d65a","title":"theme parks pubs and human zoos how the victorians invented leisure","story":"Entrepreneurs came up with increasingly elaborate ways to part Londoners from their money, inventing many staples of the modern leisure industry Whether it was visiting a “human zoo”, taking a bull on a hot-air balloon ride, or singing risqué songs about rhubarb, Victorian Londoners loved to have fun.As entrepreneurs and impresarios came up with increasingly elaborate ways to make money from the capital’s huge potential audience, Victorians effectively invented the modern leisure industry – including theme parks, pubs and professional football.As a new book by historian Lee Jackson explains, the hunt for profit took place against the backdrop of typical Victorian concerns surrounding morality, class and empire. So where did Victorians go for fun? And what still exists today?You probably won’t hear the music hall classic Pulling My Rhubarb Out at Wilton’s these days but this back-street Wapping theatre is one of the few Victorian music halls still standing. Wilton’s was built in 1859, as grand purpose-built music halls began to appear in London following changes in licensing laws. Crowds loved the mix of smutty and sentimental songs, as well as slapstick, circus performers and black face minstrels.InBy the 1860s, music halls were drawing crowds twice as large as the old West End theatres, whose owners launched various countermeasures – including downright duplicitous manipulation of licensing loopholes – to get their rivals closed down. Music halls were also accused of harbouring prostitutes or providing entertainment of a low moral and intellectual calibre, which is precisely what made them so popular.Over time, proprietors closed their bars and toned down the acts so that by 1912, music hall was deemed acceptable even for royalty. That’s when George V attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. At Wilton’s you can still see a mix of theatre, comedy and music – and there’s also a great bar.It’s now a building site near Leicester Square, but when the Argyll Rooms lost its licence in 1878, there was a riot. Drunken medical students were so incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt they took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police. That gives you an idea of the sort of crowd that used to frequent the Argyll Rooms, the West End’s premier and most dissolute dance hall.A dance craze hit London in the 1840s, and a number of dancing rooms – or casinos – were opened, including Laurent’s Casino off the Strand. This was London’s first night-club, and it later transferred to the Argyll Rooms on Shaftesbury Avenue, taking over a space that had previously been used as a museum, automaton show and indoor “centrifugal railway” – a primitive rollercoaster complete with loop-the-loop. The proprietor was Bob Bignell, a West End bookmaker, who saw money in the dancing trend. His club soon attracted crowds out for a good time – too much so for the authorities, leading to its eventual shutdown.The Argyll closed as the dance fad came to an end, and Bignell turned the space into the Trocadero music hall. It kept that name through the 20th century when it was transformed into one of London’s naffest tourist attractions. The site currently awaits development into a hotel.One of the most distinctive features of the handsome Prince Alfred pub in Maida Vale is the panelled iders which you have to duck under to move from bar to bar. These were installed to ensure different classes of customer had their own safe space – and class was a major concern for Victorian moral authorities, who worried that the new forms of mass entertainment were cutting across traditional boundaries.Sumptuous boozers like the Prince Alfred, rich with decorative wood and etched glass, were created to partly address the class issue by making gin-drinking itself respectable – but even then, the different classes needed to know their place.Temperance campaigners were not satisfied. They argued that it was precisely the gorgeousness of the gin palace – the gaslight and gilding, brass fixtures and fittings, large windows, etched glass and mirrors, not to mention the innovation of counter service – that lured more respectable members of the working-class into the sinful public house. Despite such concerns, these would all become standard features of the Victorian pub and remain the defining characteristics of the pubs we use today.A set of wrought iron gates by a riverside park are all that remain of the Cremorne, once one of the most notorious of London’s Victorian pleasure gardens. Stretching from the Kings Road to the Thames, it opened in 1843 and along with the gardens at Vauxhall, Highbury Barn, Walworth and Islington’s Eagle Tavern, catered for thousands of nightly visitors.The average pleasure garden had promenades, bandstands and follies, plus curious performers such as Michael Boai, who played music on his chin, or “the Beckwith frogs”, a family who ate breakfast in an underwater tank. There were elaborate firework displays, including Cremorne’s pyro-boosted pride-restoring recreations of the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Another Victorian favourite was the novelty hot-air balloon ascent. At Cremorne, a balloonist called Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved.Cremorne was managed by a trio of West End publicans, and became identified with a fast set who would swan down to Chelsea after the theatres had closed, raising hell. Brawls were commonplace, and the gardens were popular with prostitutes and Londoners looking for fun. It closed in 1877, after losing its licence. Pleasure gardens more generally lost their raison d’etre with the establishment of public parks. London’s rapid growth meant the valuable land was usually sold to developers, which is why so little of London’s great pleasure gardens remain.Pleasure gardens were also overshadowed by larger exhibition grounds such as the Crystal Palace, which tried to find a way of balancing entertainment with a hard dose of cultural education. Little physically remains of the Crystal Palace itself, which moved to Sydenham from Hyde Park in 1854, but the grand 200-acre grounds still exist as a public park.The great glass building was used as a sort of showcase for luxury goods but also had zones with fine art, artefacts and historic architecture such as a Roman villa and 50-ft copies of the statues of Ramesses II in Abu Simbel. There were dioramas showing flora and fauna from around the world, complete with models of West Indians and Native Americans. The gardens hosted elaborate entertainments – a race featuring ponies ridden by monkeys was one highlight – as well as plays, operas and pantomimes. There was also a “human zoo” featuring 60 Somalis, transported from Africa to be gawped at by curious South London. The Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire in 1936 but its footprint remains, while you can get a sense of its somewhat haphazard educational ambition through the beloved stone statues of dinosaurs.Other exhibition grounds leant towards more straightforward fun: the Earl’s Court grounds were like a modern theme park, with Ferris wheel, rollercoaster and Buffalo Bill’s cowboy show, albeit with sideshows tailored towards an annual theme, often chosen to attract finance from commercial partners. This was partly the work of impresario Imre Kiralfy, who created fantastic theatrical displays at Kensington’s Olympia such as Venice In London, which combined canals and three-quarter scale gondolas with walkable streets and bridges and working restaurants and cafes. Kiralfy would later open White City, the epitome of the Victorian theme park’s promise to provide both “instruction and amusement”. White City had orientalist architecture, thrilling rides, human zoos (Irish this time) and pavilions sponsored by Moet \u0026amp Chandon all tied together with a thread of education that was increasingly hard to discern amid the ornamental canals and rickety roller-coasters.On the site of the Methodist Central Hall was a short-lived attraction that attempted to transport the seaside to central London. It was railways that made Margate and Southend accessible to Londoners, and some of the leisure activities peculiar to the seaside soon made it back to the capital.One of these was the winter garden, a sort of compact, centralised exhibition ground that day-trippers could visit when it rained. Southport opened the first in 1874 and the concept was transposed in full to Westminster in 1876.Southport’s winter garden offered a promenade through a large tropical conservatory, a basement aquarium complete with crocodiles, games rooms, a concert hall and landscaped gardens with caves, grottoes and ornamental bridges. A skating rink was later added. London’s version, the Royal Aquarium and Winter Garden, was a straight copy, crocodiles excepted. It flopped, and the site was levelled in 1903.Fulham FC, London’s oldest professional football club, still play at their first ground, built by the Victorians in 1896. The oldest parts of the ground are the pavilion and main stand, dating to 1905, and a sign of how popular and financially successful football had become under the Victorians. Although versions of the sport had been around for centuries, it was the Victorians who codified the game and then professionalised it. This led to enclosed grounds where spectators paid for admittance, with the income spent on acquiring new players. The modern game was born.London has many claims to football history. The first trial match under FA rules was played in 1863 at Limes Field, the former home of Barnes FC, since demolished. A second demonstration match took place in Battersea Park. London was also the location of the first FA Cup final, at Kennington Oval in 1872, while finals were also played at Crystal Palace and the since demolished Lillie Bridge in West Brompton.London’s oldest football ground? That’s the Old Spotted Dog in Forest Gate, a former cricket ground that has been home to non-league Clapton FC since 1888.Palaces of Pleasure by Lee Jackson is published by YaleFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7befb95e15636a58baf9b6e6e3d022563cd2644/0_86_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da41cebf04f93102c0ebab4891a332eb","title":"lib dems stained austerity trust tories","story":"The Liberal Democrats are back, or so we’re told, with Jo Swinson’s leadership victory being pitched as the rebirth of the party. The unique conditions of Brexit have given the Lib Dems not only a reason to exist but the opportunity to detoxify their brand after their fatal coalition with the Conservatives, and to cast themselves as a reforming, progressive party in troubled times.Instead, Swinson repeatedly claims credit for the Lib Dems being a moderating influence on the Tories. They may well have helped to rein in the Conservatives on some things (the party is said to have forced George Osborne to temporarily shelve child tax credit cuts) but this fundamentally misses the point: the Lib Dems weren’t coerced into the partnership, they voluntarily chose it, and as such were a reason every Tory cut that was passed was possible.This isn’t about holding grudges or some sort of ideological purity. Political parties naturally evolve depending on the political times, and progress in policy positions should be credited. It was four years ago this week that the Labour party adopted its abysmal abstention strategy for key “welfare reform”, but the party has since wrestled internally to have the strong anti-austerity message it holds today, winning back support in the process.The same cannot be said for the Lib Dems. This is a party that as recently as last year spoke of sacrificing some of the poorest people in society to benefit sanctions in exchange for a 5p tax on plastic bags while in coalition. Nor are their MPs against forming a pact with the Tories again, with Swinson simply ruling out joining forces with Boris Johnson or any Brexiteer. Swinson, for her part, could hardly be called a fully progressive figure. As employment minister, she reversed workers’ rights by introducing charges of up to £1,200 for the privilege of attending an employment tribunal (a move later ruled unlawful by the supreme court) and even considered cutting the minimum wage, all at a time when workers faced an unprecedented squeeze.There is a sense in some circles that disabled people and working-class families should “get over it” that those who can’t summon optimism for the revived Lib Dems are too tribal, irrational, or stuck in the past. But this insultingly dismisses the scale of suffering austerity has caused – typically by commentators who have never experienced the pain themselves – and recasts it as a historical slight. Go to your closed local Sure Start centre or try to get your elderly mother a social care package and this all seems ever-present news.Similarly, it’s often inferred that compared with Brexit, cuts to services are insignificant. The danger of no-deal Brexit is real and this will hit the poorest hardest. But the idea that this is enough to revive the Lib Dems – and that all else should somehow be forgotten – is a symptom of a political discourse that too often suggests nothing but Brexit matters. Some voters may find it easier to switch back to the Lib Dems, but large numbers of disabled and low-income families will find it considerably harder to trust them ever again. If you’re queueing in your wheelchair at a food bank because the coalition took your disability benefits, it’s unlikely you’ll be tempted to the yellow fold, even by the promise of a second EU referendum.Besides, the two issues are linked. While credit should be given to the party leading the charge against Brexit, there is irony in the Lib Dem position. After all, savage cuts to services and living standards helped create the conditions for the leave vote in the first place. Indeed, it feels a bit rich to see a party that helped heap austerity on to struggling families now leading concern for the country over Brexit. For many disabled and poor people, years of Lib Dem-enabled cuts mean hardship is already here. Austerity has harmed millions of people in Britain, and continues to wreck lives. It is not too much to ask that the politicians who administered it learn lessons before their rehabilitation begins. As it stands, the rebirthed Lib Dems are still deeply stained.• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and the author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b983e3b8becc7992baaf1e01d56df66e8301c6bc/0_80_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574e7e6a56ecd4bab3495ea3a6e2262f","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of climb","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘climb’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘climb’.Share your photos of what climb means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 24 July at 10am.

We apologise for this, and regret any distress that this has caused Sir Roger,” the magazine added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbc54cce1554bc133067afcad204290848f5f397/337_175_1081_648/master/1081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3185d984e507ec59f3257e4ff41c5f","title":"four inspirational days in nova scotia","story":"South London artist and muralist Remi Rough finds visual inspiration in the region’s rocky landscapes, colourful villages and journeys on water … and captures it in a muralI’ll be completely honest the only thing I knew about Nova Scotia before I went was that rapper and hip-hop artist Buck 65 is from there! What I found was a completely charming province, and one that’s very erse, too, with so many different experiences you can have. You’ve got city life in Halifax, then sprawling national parks, and so much of life here is led on or by the water. I came here with the challenge of creating a mural on a building in Halifax, and I found so much inspiration along the way. The result was amazing – I left a little piece of myself on the harbour front.As there are year-round direct flights from London to Halifax and they only take six hours, you can get right into the Halifax swing of things without long transfers or bad jet lag. Spend your first morning walking along its historic harbour front to get a feel for the city. It has great cultural experiences where you can learn more about the region’s past, like the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, and the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. The Titanic exhibit at the Maritime Museum is particularly moving – while ship’s survivors went to New York, all who perished came to Halifax, and you can learn about their poignant personal stories here.One of the absolute gems of this region is the quaint, colourful village of Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site. Established in 1753 by the Brits, it’s just an hour’s drive from Halifax, and is best known for its beautiful, multicoloured 18th- and 19th-century buildings. There are so many shades, from tomato red, to deep purple and peppermint green ... strolling around and taking it all in is a delight, especially along King St, which has been nicknamed “the Unesco fresco”.Lunenburg is the perfect place to go kayaking. Set off from the bay at Blue Rocks, a spectacular 10-minute drive along the coast from the town of Lunenburg, and paddle through dozens of little channels out to the open sea. There’s plenty of nature around - I saw an osprey, and a huge heron. And I do love that people here spend so much time outdoors – they have everything on their doorstep.Back in Lunenburg, lunch at the Beach Pea Kitchen \u0026amp Bar  – they have some cracking fishcakes. Most restaurants here serve fish and seafood, and it’s all so beautifully fresh. Spend the rest of the day hanging out in town, just walking around and taking in the scenery and the slower pace of life. For dinner, treat yourself to lobster at the Old Fish Factory restaurant, one of the best places in town for it.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site, about an hour from Lunenburg, has got an incredible collection of petroglyphs, stories carved on rocks by the Mi’kmaq, a First Nations people, thousands of years ago. Our guide was great, and told us all about their history, and the people who’d created the carvings. The Mi’kmaw people, for instance, are credited with inventing the ice hockey stick – they are recorded as having played the game as early as the 18th century. Today, October is celebrated as Mi’kmaq history month, and the entire Mi’kmaw Nation celebrates Treaty Day annually on 1 October – the date when the Peace and Friendship treaty of 1752 was signed by the Mi’kmaq of Shubenacadie and the Brits.Peggy’s Cove is the perfect place to stretch your legs on the drive back to Halifax, and take in some amazing views of sea and sky. It’s got a strikingly elegant lighthouse, but what impressed me most were the rocks which covered the whole area – it looked like the moon, a completely alien landscape.Finish the day back in Halifax dining with locals at Edna, which stands for “eat, drink, nourish, always”. It does a mix of fish, meat and veggie dishes, and you eat at communal tables, which is fun.Start your morning with a sail around Halifax harbour on the stunning schooner Bluenose II. It’s a faithful reconstruction of the first Bluenose, a 1920s racing and fishing ship that, unfortunately, sank in 1946. We set off at full sail and got amazing views of Halifax from the water. The captain, Phil, is a great character, with a huge beard!Then it was time to do my mural the space was a stairwell at the back of the Marriott Harbourfront hotel. Normally it would take me around three days to do a piece this size (it’s around 7 x 10 metres) but we only had a day! I used inspiration from all the places I’d seen, so there were lots of muted greens to represent things like moss on the rocks at Peggy’s Cove, and mustard colours for the seaweed at Blue Rocks, then lighter notes like peppermint green for the houses in Lunenburg.For dinner, try the Bicycle Thief, a lovely, laid-back Italian restaurant. The spaghetti with meatballs is massive and delicious!The next day, before I left for the airport, I spent a few more hours finishing the mural. A lot of people helped, like a guy from the crew of the Bluenose II, who’s also a street artist. It felt great to give something to the community I hope they like it! I’d love to come back and spend more time in Nova Scotia – hopefully that’ll happen soon.Inspired to visit?

Queues are much shorter at major attractions such as Niagara Falls, so why not take a Hornblower Niagara Cruise, a ride on Niagara Helicopters or a thrilling MistRider zipline ride? The spring weather is ideal for bike tours of Niagara’s wineries, distilleries and craft breweries, such as Niagara Oast House Brewers.If you would like to see where maple syrup comes from, around March is the time to join a Sugar Bush tour to see how the trees are tapped or find a pancake festival in April to enjoy the end product. This season is also a good time to go hiking before the crowds come out and the weather heats up. The Bruce Trail (Unesco biosphere designated) stretches from the Niagara Escarpment to Tobermory, 500 miles of scenic trails, while you don’t even need to leave Toronto to hike the forested slopes of the 16 hectare (40-acre) High park.Summer unofficially starts on the third weekend of May with the Victoria Day holiday marking Queen Victoria’s birthday. It’s the start of cottage season, when all roads lead to Georgian Bay, Muskoka or Lake Simcoe, for barbecues, watersports and weekend partying at Ontarians’ seasonal residences. With the weather hot and humid, Ontario has endless supplies of water to cool off in paddle or cruise around the 1,000 Islands near Kingston, sail on the Great Lakes, or enjoy a canoe or kayak adventure on one of the many lakes or rivers in Muskoka. Whitewater raft just 90 minutes from Ottawa, along the Ottawa River or take a LeBoat cruiser along the Rideau canal to Kingston.Don’t miss the waterways of Algonquin park – Justin Trudeau spent his childhood summers here. Like living life on two wheels? Then Manitoulin Island on Lake Huron in Northern Ontario is the place to be, with over 800km of road-biking routes.Summer is the peak season for festivals – starting with the major fun around Canada Day on 1 July anywhere in Ontario, and then you have choices that range from the Niagara wine festival to TIFF (Toronto international film festival), taking in Nuit Blanche art projects at major art venues, and even music and food truck festivals. Let’s not forget Glengarry Highland Games, the Whitchurch-Stouffville strawberry festival and the Toronto Summerlicious food festival, where more than 200 restaurants offer specially priced set menus, among many others.As the leaves start to fall, enjoy the abundance of colours in Ontario’s thousands of miles of forest. Allow two weeks for a proper fly-drive tour from Toronto of highlights including Niagara, Blue Mountain, Muskoka, Algonquin park, Ottawa, 1,000 Islands and Prince Edward County. September and October are also prime times for spotting the northern lights ride the Polar Bear Express  from Cochrane to Moosonee for your best chance of catching this natural phenomenon.In Ottawa, this is a good time to visit the National Gallery of Canada, the city’s premier art collection, or the fascinating Canadian Museum of History, the most visited museum in the country. Take a cycle tour to explore the capital’s many interesting neighbourhoods such as Byward Market and Centretown, indulge in a craft brewery tour or a food tour (or both!). Overindulgence in good food and drink peaks around Canada’s Thanksgiving in October. Major events to look out for include the Blue Mountains apple harvest festival, Bala cranberry festival, and Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest. Many small towns have their own homely harvest and pumpkin festivals, complete with family fun such as traditional music and ploughing matches.As the snowfall peaks, ice hockey fills the TV schedules but it’s even more fun to get out and enjoy the winter wonderland for yourself. This is the time of year when the mist and spray off Niagara Falls freezes on the rocks, adding to the spectacle. For skiing, Blue Mountain is Ontario’s largest resort and great for beginners. Resorts in the Blue Mountain region or Muskoka, such as the luxurious JW Marriott Rosseau, Sherwood Inn, and Cedar Grove Lodge, or Deerhurst in Huntsville offer activities including cross-country skiing, skating, snow shoeing, snowmobiling and dog sledding, with a whole menu of spa treatments to ease any tired muscles.Ontario’s many spas include award-winning ones in Niagara and Prince Edward County, perfect for a break at any time of year but even cosier when the weather is chilly outside. At St Anne’s spa, 90 minutes from Toronto, you can even get wrapped in hot chocolate. For festive festivals, look out for Winterlude in Ottawa, with ice-carving, skating and curling the Icewine festival in Niagara Falls (which also celebrates its food), Winterlicious in Toronto (more seasonal culinary delights!), and Sault Sainte Marie’s Winter Carnival Bon Soo, complete with polar bear swims (where you swim like one, through an ice hole, rather than with one).Discover more of what Ontario has on offer all year round with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3786806beda70dbb971cf00b7046643eb62cbc89/0_263_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f93dbfede049d5f686014cd58dbe1a3b","title":"nissan refuses government request on qashqai emissions","story":"Manufacturer told DVSA it would not retrofit polluting vehicles, despite other firms agreeing to modificationsNissan’s decision to ignore a government request for emissions modifications to thousands of polluting cars has been branded a scandal by environmental campaigners.The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) discovered that the Sunderland-made diesel Qashqai model emits 17 times more nitrogen oxides (NOx) than EU limits allow.It asked Nissan to retrofit the vehicles to reduce their emissions, as some other manufacturers have, but Nissan told the DVSA it was “not possible to do a recalibration for existing customers” because it wants “to focus energy and resources on the new models”.“We find Nissan’s approach on addressing these extremely high-emitting vehicles unacceptable,” said a DVSA statement, pointing out that Renault, which uses a similar engine to the one used in the Qashqai, would be offering engine modifications to customers.Similarly, Vauxhall is to make free adjustments to all of the diesel Astras it has sold across the EU, including almost 14,000 sold in the UK.“Diesel car manufacturers have never been held to account for contributing to the illegal and harmful levels of air pollution in the UK,” said Andrea Lee, part of the clean air team at campaign group ClientEarth.Children and babies’ developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.\u0026nbspA comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream.In the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.“Even new diesel cars are still not as clean as manufacturers would have us believe.”The DVSA created its market surveillance unit in 2016 following the revelations that the Volkswagen Group had deliberately cheated on emissions tests.From 1 September 2019, all new cars sold in the UK will have to meet “real driving emissions” standards that put stringent limits on the amount of nitrogen oxides that can be emitted. Using the new standard, the DVSA tested nine diesel cars and found that older models of the Qashqai breached the limits.This “significant exceedance” meant the Qashqai was “not sufficiently well designed to control NOx in real world conditions”, said the DVSA. The agency, which is a branch of the Department for Transport, has prosecution powers which mean it can force manufacturers to issue recall notices. However, it has not done so in this case.“We remain concerned by the poor real-world emissions control of a number of the vehicles we tested this year,” said the DVSA.“Their emissions are high and are directly contributing to the air quality problems we face and the resulting health impacts.”Rosalind Readhead, an independent candidate for London mayor in 2020, said Nissan ought to “immediately remove” the older Qashqais to “protect the health of children and vulnerable adults.”“This is a consumer scandal that is costing people’s health and cannot be justified,” agreed ClientEarth’s Lee. “Refusing to retrofit overpolluting vehicles does not take into account the health of people who are suffering today.”“All Nissan vehicles fully comply with today’s emissions legislation,” Nissan said in a statement.Nissan has made more than 3m Qashqais at its Washington plant in the north-east of England over the past 10 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6967e6cd6884185efdcd36714fe6526dc711565/31_142_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb217b2429686c846b420e35f0199a1f","title":"powerful undersea images photographer roger grace in pictures","story":"The marine biologist, conservationist and specialist underwater photographer Roger Grace died at his New Zealand home in June.

I love wearing a big skirt where your hips feel free.I originally started dressing in vintage because, when I was in high school, I couldn’t afford the designer jeans that my friends had. I discovered vintage and would try on clothes that reminded me of things I saw in magazines. I wore lingerie as outerwear, little bustiers, and tried to throw together a look that wasn’t reliant on having money.This was in the 90s, when vintage clothes weren’t quite as valuable as they are now. I have things in my wardrobe that I bought at that time that I still love wearing.

The initial announcement, one of many to come, is highlighted by Steven Soderbergh’s Panama Papers drama The Laundromat, starring Streep as well as Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas, which is set to be one of Netflix’s biggest Oscar pushes of the season.Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks will also be unveiling his new film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, a biopic of children’s TV staple Mister Rogers from Can You Ever Forgive Me? director Marielle Heller. “My challenge as a director was to get Tom Hanks to become less Tom Hanks,” Heller said to Entertainment Weekly. “This will feel very different from how you’ve seen him before.”Jennifer Lopez will also bring her fact-based drama Hustlers to the festival, a film about a group of strippers who stole money from their white-collar clientele. It also stars Crazy Rich Asians breakout Constance Wu, Lizzo and Cardi B, who director Lorene Scafaria chased for two years to be in the movie.Other true stories include Judy with Renee Zellweger playing Judy Garland, Ford v Ferrari, starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, Harriet starring Cynthia Erivo as abolitionist and activist Harriet Tubman, Radioactive starring Rosamund Pike as Marie Curie, Just Mercy starring Michael B Jordan as civil rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson, Hugh Jackman in Bad Education about the largest public school embezzlement scandal in history and The Two Popes starring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce.The festival has also recruited DC’s much-anticipated Joker, a gritty R-rated origins story starring Joaquin Phoenix as the anarchic Batman villain. “I wouldn’t quite classify this as like any genre,” Phoenix said to Collider. “I wouldn’t say it’s a superhero movie, or a studio movie … It feels unique.”British films featured in the lineup include Ordinary Love, a romantic drama starring Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville as a couple facing the possibility of death, Military Wives, a feelgood comedy telling the true story of the choir that gained fame in 2011 starring Sharon Horgan and Kristin Scott-Thomas, an adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s semi-autobiographical bestseller How to Build a Girl starring Lady Bird’s Beanie Feldstein and Michael Winterbottom’s satire Greed starring Steve Coogan as a retail billionaire.The much-anticipated adaptation of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch, starring Ansel Elgort and Nicole Kidman, will also be shown as well as Thor: Ragnarok director Taiki Watiti’s offbeat second world war comedy Jojo Rabbit starring Scarlett Johansson, who will also appear in Noah Baumbach’s Netflix drama Marriage Story alongside Adam Driver.Last year’s festival saw the world premiere of Green Book which went on to win the Oscar for best picture.

I’m highly motivated and hope to give back on the pitch.”The 22-year-old Brazilian has been handed the No 9 shirt, leaving the Bundesliga club after four years – two of those spent on loan at Rapid Vienna.“The kid’s got an exciting time ahead of him,” Steve Bruce, the Newcastle manager, said. “He’s a smashing young player and we’re obviously delighted to get him.“It’s been going on for a little bit now, so to get him is great for everybody,” Bruce added. “He’s got everything that a modern-day player wants. He’s big, strong and athletic, and of course he’s got age on his side too, which is vitally important.Joelinton is the first arrival in a turbulent summer in which the former manager, Rafael Benítez, left after his contract was not renewed. Newcastle have confirmed that the fee is a club record, exceeding the £21m paid for Miguel Almirón in January.The signing of Joelinton was announced after the Premier League received a formal complaint from Sheffield Wednesday about Newcastle’s alleged conduct leading to the appointment of Steve Bruce as manager last week. The Premier League does have rules governing the ways in which clubs can make approaches for managers under contract, as Bruce was at Wednesday before he resigned, and there is an overriding duty for clubs to act “with the utmost good faith”.Wednesday have said that some legal issues were outstanding when Bruce was appointed to manage Newcastle, two days after resigning from his job at Hillsborough. The league’s rules provide for a wide range of possible disciplinary processes if breaches of the rules are proven, including the appointment of an independent commission which can impose the most serious penalties. The league will examine Wednesday’s complaint and decide how it should be handled, although disputes over approaches for players or managers rarely reach a disciplinary stage and tend to be settled between the clubs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58e9de142562c0d223db275d300684d3e618f73/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0318bf97257cd0cea62e093af519a9b","title":"serious office investigates de la rue over south sudan operations","story":"Shares of UK company producing Bank of England notes have more than halved in past yearThe Serious Fraud Office is investigating the world’s biggest printer of banknotes over suspected corruption in South Sudan.The SFO said it was examining how the UK company De La Rue, which produces notes for the Bank of England, and associated iniduals conducted business in the African country.De La Rue said it was cooperating with the SFO, which investigates serious fraud, bribery and corruption.

How much do the tests really reveal about their ability to conceive?I am in a determinedly neutral room on Harley Street, my feet in stirrups, my dignity nearly preserved by a flimsy sheet. On the monitor in front of me is my womb, empty of baby but nevertheless being energetically narrated by Prof Nick Macklon. He points out my contraceptive device, my uterine lining gearing up for evacuation in about a fortnight, the visible vacancy left by my just-departed egg – Macklon describes it all as being like a pivotal scene in an action movie. The stakes, certainly, feel high.I am midway through my “fertility MOT”: yes, like for a vehicle, but for my ovaries. The two-part process – offered by the London Women’s Clinic (LWC) and other fertility clinics like it, for a few hundred pounds – consists of a blood test followed two weeks later by a “not overly invasive” pelvic ultrasound. Alongside a consultation about your medical history and lifestyle, the results help you to understand your own fertility status and likely ability to conceive, now and in the future. “I must say, I really hate that term, ‘MOT’,” Macklon, medical director of LWC, had remarked earlier, back at his desk. “Women aren’t cars.” We aren’t cars – but there are a lot of fiddly parts, which we are mostly ignorant of until they don’t work.If you had asked me half an hour ago – as I sat in the clinic’s stately waiting room, a baby’s cry faintly, ominously audible from afar – I would have put my grasp on my fertility as slightly above average. I knew, for example, that I had been born with a finite number of eggs and that, at 28, I was approaching the age at which I should be starting to take it seriously. But with the reality of children still entirely, ludicrously at odds with my day-to-day life, I had felt content to leave the picture blurry.I wasn’t even sure that I wanted them, after all. From when I was a little girl to my mid-20s, I had steadfastly maintained that I would never have children of my own. In recent years, my flatmate had amassed a collection of photographs of me holding babies, their faces creased in terror, that, as a whole, seemed to form some damning body of evidence of my lack of maternal instincts.But as I reached my late 20s, something started to shift, tediously on schedule. Choices such as whether to move country, or change job, or dump or not-dump a boyfriend started to seem properly consequential. Friends my age started admitting to concerns about “running out of time” older friends who had witnessed too many heartbreaking struggles to conceive, urged me to take them seriously. And the reality of being a woman means you are afforded the luxury of ambivalence only for so long.The MOT service, offered by LWC for the past two years, was born of two things, says Macklon: greater clarity about the impact of time on fertility, and the widespread lack of awareness of it. A 2018 meta-study concluded that “knowledge is insufficient, particularly in determining when female fertility markedly decreases” – and this despite the tendency to delay children until later in life. In 2016, the average age of women at first birth was 28.8 years, compared with 27.3 years in 2006. “There is clearly a lack of understanding among women that, essentially, their fertility ends about 10 years before they get their menopause, rather than when they get their menopause,” says Macklon. “That is the huge information gap.”Though they may be getting periods, many women do not even start reliably ovulating every month until they are in their mid-20s. Fertility peaks soon after, then starts to decline, though “not catastrophically”, Macklon adds. “It’s probably a steady progression downwards from about the age of 27 or 28.” My age, then. I am starting to feel a bit panicked. The fertile window is from the mid-20s to the mid-30s – not exactly languorous, even with physiology on your side, and that can vary significantly.I was correct that women were born with all the eggs they will ever have, about 1m of them, but that number has usually halved by puberty – and I am shocked to learn that we lose about 30 to 40 eggs each month. Before each period, Macklon explains with enthusiasm, “a whole group of eggs will have decided: ‘It’s our time now. We’ve been waiting 20-odd years this is it, off we go.’” Hooked on hormones, they start growing.Two weeks before ovulation, between about five and 20 eggs – a clutch, if you will – will be contenders. “Of those 20, maybe one will be a little bit more mature, a little bit more sensitive to the hormones” – and that frontrunner will start producing another hormone to stymie its competitors. “It’s very interesting sibling behaviour,” says Macklon, almost fondly. (And just as cut-throat as sperms’ race to fertilise, I note – without any of the mythologising.)Over time, women not only lose eggs, but their quality depletes. “The consequences are, as women leave childbearing until their late 30s, their chances of producing an egg that is of high enough quality to produce a healthy baby falls,” says Macklon. The fertility MOT can give an indication of “where an inidual is on their biological clock”, and that there is demand for it reflects a more proactive approach to family planning.Ranging in price from about £200 for a consultation with no pelvic ultrasound, up to £450 for a male and female package (and £640 for two women), the service is not cheap, and about half the 800 women a year who undergo the consultation with LWC do so as a first step towards starting fertility treatment, “rather than for reassurance or help with future planning”, says Macklon.Those women whose MOTs return problematic results may also be advised to consider egg-freezing, prompting concerns that the tests could be steering them down an uncertain, expensive path.The British Fertility Society (BFS) says that it is important to remember that these tests were developed to inform IVF treatment, not natural fertility, and as such are open to interpretation: “There is no doubt that tests showing a good ovarian reserve are reassuring but they by no means guarantee a baby equally, a poor or impaired ovarian reserve does not mean you will struggle and need fertility treatment.Dr Raj Mathur, the BFS secretary, says his view of egg-freezing is “cautiously favourable … but like everything, we are in danger of overselling its benefits and not adequately reflecting the problems”.Similarly, he said, though the MOT might help some women and couples in their family planning, it should not be mistaken for a comprehensive diagnosis of inidual fertility. “They are not looking at other aspects of women’s fertility – whether you ovulate or not, whether your fallopian tubes are blocked – and they are often not looking at the man. They are a kind of incomplete snapshot of one aspect of a couple’s ability to conceive, and that can easily give false reassurance.”The blood-test component of the MOT measures levels of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) given off by growing follicles, which indicates how many eggs you have left – but a study last year found that a diminished ovarian reserve was not associated with infertility. “If you’re just starting to try for a baby, a low AMH or a high AMH will not affect your chance of conceiving,” says Mathur. Macklon agrees that a single measure of AMH says little, but adds that in the context of the MOT, and discussed in the broader context of the inidual’s medical, personal and lifestyle history, it helps to estimate the length of the patient’s reproductive period.At the start of his career, Macklon says, he was typically tasked with problems of infertility: “You know: ‘I’ve tried for children for three years. It hasn’t worked can you help?’ Now, it’s completely different.” Over the past decade, and particularly the past five years, he has been more often approached by single women and new couples wanting to know if they should get a move on. There is “increasing realisation”, reflected in the rising interest in the MOT, “that maybe it’s a good thing to plan these things”.Yet many women – even those who know for sure that they want children one day – still leave any further interrogation of the idea until it is either a practical reality or there is possible cause for concern. “One of the hardest parts of our job is having to break bad news to women who don’t think they’re going to have a problem,” said Ben Cordle, a spokesman for LWC, when I called him a few weeks ago to make an appointment. It was possible for a fit, healthy woman in her early 30s with no reason to second-guess her fertility to record an AMH level as low as 2, from a healthy given range of 4.1 to 58.In fact, the thought occurred to me only this morning: that this appointment I had made on no greater impulse than mild curiosity could change the course of my life. On my way to the clinic, questions that I had so far kept comfortably peripheral were brought to the front of mind, where they jostled for prominence.The big one, obviously: what if I’m infertile? Then the shades of nuance: if I’m infertile, would I still write a story about it? What if I’m certified so fertile, I can safely push motherhood out to 40-plus – would I leave it as late as I can, or keep pace with my peers? Could I afford to freeze my eggs? Do I even want a baby? And the most frightening thought of all: what if the test says I must have one right now, or never?In this tastefully carpeted clinic, returning to Macklon’s desk after my ultrasound, I am about to find out.Relative to his somewhat whimsical tour of my womb, Macklon is all business as he goes over my results and medical history. I have a normal uterus. A normal endometrial thickness. My right ovary appeared normal, with 10 follicles – also normal – and “the left ovary looked similar”.

But then I realise I am lucky to have that result, lucky to know that I’ve got a few years to go yet. The MOT, Macklon says, presents “some options which we didn’t have in the past other than to say ‘get a move on’ or ‘you can relax’.” A remark he makes in passing lingers with me long after the appointment: “If you think about it, women have to get almost all their life events into a period of about 15 years: career, having children.” It is not long, but I have time – and just the process of finding out has focused my mind on how I want to spend it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f345508d0a6826ed2fd0a61d2351bd873912fed/0_0_6347_3808/master/6347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88efa4a21e3e33dc066ee3383ff0c49","title":"stranded in pakistan why did the home office deny a baby a visa","story":"Nina Saleh, a British resident for 20 years, travelled to Pakistan to adopt a baby and was then repeatedly denied a visa, leaving her trapped abroad for months on end.

Direct adoption from Pakistan to the UK is not allowed as there is no inter-country adoption agreement in place. Instead, couples or iniduals coming from the UK use an established route of getting legal ship of the baby and then travelling back to Britain, where the authorities formalise the adoption process. Nina was aware of this and had gone through a stringent and lengthy adoption process in the UK with British authorities’ involvement. But Nina found herself being repeatedly refused a visa to return home with Sofia and unable to get any answers from the Home Office about why she was being denied. Eventually, after months of being stranded in a city where she knew no one, she contacted the . Within 48 hours of the story being published, the visa decision was overturned.

Perhaps unsurprisingly at a time of political uncertainty, the government has stepped back from the bold action required,” said Jo Bibby, the director of health at the Health Foundation thinktank.“Overall the paper falls a long way short of the comprehensive shift in approach needed to create healthier lives for people in England.”The document outlines an ambition for everyone in England to have gained five extra years of healthy life expectancy – free of disease or disability – by 2035. However, Bibby warned that without much tougher government action to tackle the underlying causes of so much ill-health “it could take as long as 75 years – not 16 – to reach this goal”.However, it only appeared on the gov.uk website early on Monday evening, and – unusually – with no attempt made to alert the media.“A year ago the secretary of state said, to great fanfare, that prevention was one of his priorities. Now the prevention green paper has been sneaked out in the night on the Cabinet Office website,” Ashworth said.“Is it not the truth that he has buckled under pressure from the sugar industry, is not taking on the alcohol industry, and is not taking on the tobacco industry? That is more about trying to get in with the new prime minister than putting the health needs of the nation first,” he added.Hancock replied that Dame Prof Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, was reviewing the evidence on what policies help to counteract obesity and would report later this year.The green paper also proposes that the sugar tax on soft drinks could be extended to sugary milk drinks and suggests ways to cut salt consumption.Prof Andrew Goddard, the president of the Royal College of Physicians, lamented its “dearth of imagination” and reliance on iniduals taking action to improve their health.“Perhaps the biggest omission is a clear understanding of the link between poverty and ill-health. While iniduals have a responsibility to look after themselves, there is something about the way our society is structured that produces that imbalance,” he added.The British Medical Association said the paper should have included plans to introduce minimum unit pricing of alcohol and legally binding limits on air pollution.David Buck, a public health expert at the King’s Fund, criticised the “shabby way” the green paper emerged. “The paper is a missed opportunity to build on the success of the sugar tax by taking a bolder approach to using tax and regulation to improve public health,” he said.The Royal Society for Public Health welcomed the document’s “ambitious goals”. But it urged ministers to embrace more radical public health policies such as mandatory targets for the removal of salt from food and an end to years of Whitehall cuts to local councils’ public health budgets.Seema Kennedy, a health minister, said the government’s plans would help the NHS change from being a treatment-based service to “a national wellness service”, more focused on prevention of illness.However, it is unclear whether the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, will act on the paper’s proposals given his opposition to extending the sugar tax and general hostility to more interventionist measures to improve public health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35012fbb72d7578da5601dee76e83ce428c2ec22/0_0_1831_757/master/1831.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8ad70324539fe952ef2dc4aa823afbaf 1880w","title":"adam peaty backs duncan scott decision snub sun yang swimming world championships","story":"Adam Peaty has backed the decision by the British bronze medallist Duncan Scott to snub Sun Yang on the podium on Tuesday after the controversial Chinese swimmer’s victory in the 200m freestyle at the world championships in Gwangju.Sun, who is swimming in Gwangju with the court of arbitration for sport to hear a doping case against him in September, was handed the win when the Lithuanian Danas Rapsys was disqualified for a false start.Scott congratulated the silver medallist Katsuhiro Matsumoto of Japan and the Russian Martin Malyutin, who finished in the same time as the Briton, but blanked Sun on the podium.The Chinese swimmer reacted angrily, shouting “You’re a loser, I’m a winner” while gesturing at Scott, who also refused to take part in a group photo on the podium and kept his distance from Sun as they left the stage.Scott declined to elaborate on his actions to reporters but Peaty, his teammate said Scott was “completely right” to take action, adding that Sun should consider his place in swimming.The incident comes two days after the Australian Mack Horton refused to share the podium with Sun after the 400m.Sun, who served a doping ban in 2014 and was labelled a “drug cheat” by Horton before the Rio Olympics final, got the green light to compete in Gwangju after being cleared by a Fina panel of breaching the governing body’s rules earlier this year.Sun, who also won gold in the 200 in 2017, touched in a time of 1:44.93, with Matsumoto 0.29 behind in second and Malyutin and Scott taking bronze, 0.70 off Sun’s time.The crowd at the Nambu University Municipal Aquatics Center jeered the decision to disqualify Rapsys, who seemed to twitch on the starting blocks.

There was a mixed reaction to Scott’s behaviour on the podium, with Chinese fans houting and jeering while others cheered him as he left the pool deck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5732f7cf2e85ca46f5797703eb22d0310e78228/0_179_4645_2787/master/4645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e6352594e7cdc4e316131448ec093c8","title":"ashes arms race australians playing each other","story":"It is not hard to find amusement in the concept of Australia’s top cricketers preparing for the Ashes by playing a formal match against one another. An observer with English cricketing sympathies might read this as evidence of Australians thinking they are better at everything.That observer might equally have enjoyed Australia beating up Australia, before Australia wiped out Australia in return. On a green wicket at Southampton with a battery of fast bowlers using it perfectly, one half of the squad rolled the other for 105, before reaching stumps themselves at 96 for seven.This was not a situation like 1994-95, when Australia and Australia A played a tournament as teams with distinct identities. A startlingly forthright banner at the MCG read “Australia plays with itself. Oh what a feeling.” The A team had players like Merv Hughes, Michael Bevan and Damien Martyn, and quickly won public support. National captain Mark Taylor was irritated, and (so the theory goes) sabotaged Australia A by promoting their best bowler Paul Reiffel to run drinks in the senior team when the two played off in the tournament final.In 2019 it is far less formal, iding 24 Ashes hopefuls down the middle, each half under the tutelage of an assistant coach. It was initially hard to read the Hick Twelve as anything but a dozen-strong banjo choir or a group of suspects in a murder cult, but it was Graeme Hick facing off against Brad Haddin. One side had Australia’s first-choice quicks, the other had the fierce James Pattinson, the off-spin of Nathan Lyon, and the batting of Steve Smith.In fact the move to all-Australian preparation was not driven by arrogance. It was simply the lack of a viable alternative. For years now the Australian and English boards have been involved in a reverse arms race, from water pistols to pop guns to pointing rubber bananas, as the home side arranges ever-weaker opposition for its rival.England will offer county teams that are inspecting the floorboards under the second ision, Australia counters with a two-day trip to tackle an invitational XI in Alice Springs.In 2015 Australia played Essex, Northamptonshire and Kent, all of whom rested their bowlers from first choice down to about 15th choice, while preparing the flattest possible tracks and asking Australia to bat first to ensure four days of gate receipts.Essex opened the bowling with the medium seam of batsman Jesse Ryder, while Northants pulled in Richard Gleeson from a minor counties team when his captain had never seen him bowl. Australia’s Shaun Marsh was able to swell his slender tally of first-class hundreds, and was picked for Trent Bridge where he made two runs in the Test.So it made sense this time to arrange a match where Australia could control the quality of the players, and where the jostling for Ashes places guaranteed they would compete. It made sense to request a grassy wicket as chance to get used to the moving ball. The brains trust might be questioning the wisdom of that component though after losing 17 wickets in the day for 201 runs.Great fun for the seamers but the batsmen will not have benefited from their string of brief stays, nor will Lyon or John Holland from four wicketless overs of spin. The scores of note were 41 from Marnus Labuschagne and 29 from Mitchell Marsh. The two of them may well be playing off for one spot, with Labuschagne being talked up as an all-rounder for his part-time spin.Nothing has been solved with the batting, where the main question is who of Joe Burns, Marcus Harris and Cameron Bancroft will partner David Warner. Each has his claim: Burns made 180 in his last Test outing, Harris 1,000 runs in the domestic season, while management will be desperate to get Bancroft back soon so they can treat the sandpaper suspensions as resolved.The main plus from this chaotic day was a strong hit-out from Pattinson, who roared in and bowled with verve and purpose in a way that his return of one wicket does not reflect. There is something particularly interesting about seeing a team’s best bowlers take on their best batsmen. Pattinson to Warner was one, Patrick Cummins besting Smith was another.The first day might have gone to the bowlers, but as this game goes on those inidual battles could shift. As long as Pattinson and Cummins stay fit, a fast-bowling five where they sit alongside Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle looks inked in. For that alone this summer, Australia will be well worth watching no matter whom they are playing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ddbfc6265f0bd915e30b263ae33794fd7ffa02f/353_236_2543_1526/master/2543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c764e3bc1ab7ed2a236d8cf4ba9aec1","title":"england ashes candidates test ireland lords","story":"On the eve of England’s first ever Test against Ireland perhaps it was fitting that the pitch, which is almost in the centre of the square at Lord’s, looked emerald green. It will not stay that colour for long since it will be exposed to a mower on Wednesday morning and a heatwave thereafter. Despite its hue England have taken the unusual course of picking two spinners in a bowling-heavy lineup.Root had no hesitation in naming his side 24 hours before the toss. It includes two debutants: Jason Roy, occasionally of Surrey, and the less familiar Olly Stone, occasionally of Warwickshire. The former has been confined to England duties, the latter has recently been sidelined with a back problem. Both play with pace, which makes them exciting. Meanwhile three others – Jack Leach, Rory Burns and Joe Denly – will play their first Test matches on home soil.It is unlikely that Lord’s can deliver the same level of excitement as on 14 July when New Zealand were the opponents and the destiny of the World Cup was at stake. Yet there remains a keen sense of anticipation before this four-day Test.For the English players there is also plenty for which to play. The game takes place on the eve of the Ashes series and the side is in a state of considerable flux. So many players are eager to cement a place. At the top of the order Burns, after six Tests and an average of 25, is the old hand. He will now be joined by the debutant Roy with the 33-year-old Denly at No 3 and about to play his third Test.Over the next fortnight this trio will meet contrasting challenges: the canny seamers of the Lord’s expert Tim Murtagh, who seldom reaches 80mph, will be followed by the pace of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins at Edgbaston. Roy, in particular, will have to learn on the job, rather as Jos Buttler last summer. Yet few begrudge his presence in the team, especially when the alternatives available are considered.With Buttler and Ben Stokes resting, England have an excess of all-rounders in their side, which may give the Irish bowlers hope. Jonny Bairstow, reunited with his gloves, will bat at five with Moeen Ali at six. The likelihood is that both these players will drop two places come Edgbaston. Among the bowlers Chris Woakes, who has not played a Test for England since the Trent Bridge match last August, will share the new ball with Stuart Broad, another who would like to remind the selectors of his worth. There is no excuse for any England player to be underwhelmed by the prospect of this Test.The challenge for the Irish team – led by their captain for the past decade, William Porterfield – is not to be overwhelmed by the occasion. But they have plenty of experience in the form of Porterfield, Murtagh and another Middlesex stalwart, Paul Stirling, as well as Gary Wilson and Kevin O’Brien, who tormented England so brilliantly in Bangalore. Meanwhile Boyd Rankin, if selected, becomes the first cricketer since the Nawab of Pataudi in 1946 to play for and against England in Tests. It should not be so difficult for Rankin to enjoy his third Test rather more than his first in Sydney in 2014.So another historic event at Lord’s is here. It is not quite on the scale of the World Cup final and therefore there is no imperative to have it on free-to-air television. However, in the wake of that final Guy Lavender, MCC’s chief executive, has outlined the benefits of putting the best quality cricket outside the paywall and he has suggested that one Lord’s Test should be free-to-air every summer. This is not a brand new idea. Last year Ali Martin put forward that same suggestion.It is obviously an excellent idea, which would raise everyone’s estimation of both the England and Wales Cricket Board and the executives of Sky TV. The fans would welcome such a scheme. But this is no guarantee that either body will embrace such a beautifully simple plan. Instead grim and earnest explanations may be expected of why this is not possible – for contractualpoliticalfinancial reasons. Moreover, it might detract from The Hundred, on which £200m is being invested by the ECB.In this particular instance the old yet oft-repeated argument that mankind managed to pop a man on the moon 50 years ago may have some traction. They will find plenty of reasons why this plan is not possible. The chances of an Irish victory here are far greater than a free-to-air Lord’s Test being enjoyed by the wider cricketing community in the foreseeable future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5a14805e030af08fcd9e56b1799f0022cedd60/0_155_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fc69c150d5b0d4b8a18cada79aeb59f","title":"tokyo olympics 2020 medal table predictions","story":"If the Tokyo Olympics opened today, the United States would top the overall medal count and the gold-medal count. That’s the forecast released on Tuesday by Gracenote Sports, which supplies statistical analysis for sports leagues around the world.Simon Gleave, the head of sports analysis at Gracenote, said his model has the United States winning 51 gold medals, 34 silver, and 41 bronze for 126 overall. China is picked to finish second with 38 gold and 81 overall.Host nation Japan is third, which would be a strong showing for a country with a much smaller population than China or the United States. Japan is predicted to win 29 gold medals, 67 overall and take advantage of the “home-field advantage” that almost always goes to the host nation. Spain got a boost at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, China jumped in 2008 in Beijing, as did Great Britain in London in 2012. The Tokyo Olympics open on 24 July 2020. The next seven countries ranked in order of overall medals are: Russia (65), Britain (43), Australia (43), France (41), Germany (38), Netherlands (34), and Italy (32).This is fifth forecast Gleave has put together and the record is solid. “Sometimes countries overperform, or underperform, and that’s not to do with our model,” Gleave said. “That just happens in sport.”Three years ago in Rio de Janeiro, Gracenote picked the order of the top three countries correctly, and picked eight of the top 10 medal-winning countries. In the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, it correctly picked Norway to win a record number of medals and finish ahead of Germany. It also picked the top four countries correctly, and in the correct order. Its predictions for seven of the top 10 countries were within one or two medals of their final totals.Russia presents a major headache for forecasters. Its track and field athletes are still banned from Tokyo following a widespread doping scandal. The governing body of track and field, the IAAF, has had a ban on the Russian athletics federation since 2015. Russia’s medal total will be impacted by any change in eligibility. “If just before the Olympics, Russia is allowed to enter again it’s going to be a bit of an issue,” Gleave said of the medal predictions.- Great Britain finished in the top three in the last two Olympics, but is expected to fall out of that ranking. Look for Australia and GB to be vying for a spot in the top five. The Netherlands is picked to surpass its best overall medal total of 25 that was 2000 in Sydney and reach 34.- The second 10 in overall medal totals predicted are: South Korea (30), Hungary (27), Canada (25), Kenya (20), Spain (20), New Zealand (18), Ukraine (16), Brazil (15), Poland (14), and Turkey (14).- Women’s participation in Tokyo will almost reach parity with men. Countries not promoting women’s sports are sure to suffer in the medal standings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05eeabfc77729be54f173ee151220cee9e48b6c9/0_134_2431_1458/master/2431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae06bc6d01bbf3395e056450ccb29673","title":"anonymised data never be anonymous enough study finds","story":"Findings say it is impossible for researchers to fully protect real identities in datasets “Anonymised” data lies at the core of everything from modern medical research to personalised recommendations and modern AI techniques. Unfortunately, according to a paper, successfully anonymising data is practically impossible for any complex dataset.An anonymised dataset is supposed to have had all personally identifiable information removed from it, while retaining a core of useful information for researchers to operate on without fear of invading privacy. For instance, a hospital may remove patients’ names, addresses and dates of birth from a set of health records in the hope researchers may be able to use the large sets of records to uncover hidden links between conditions.But in practice, data can be deanonymised in a number of ways. In 2008, an anonymised Netflix dataset of film ratings was deanonymised by comparing the ratings with public scores on the IMDb film website in 2014 the home addresses of New York taxi drivers were uncovered from an anonymous data set of inidual trips in the city and an attempt by Australia’s health department to offer anonymous medical billing data could be reidentified by cross-referencing “mundane facts” such as the year of birth for older mothers and their children, or for mothers with many children.Despite this, data brokers such as Experian sell “deidentified” datasets containing vastly more information per person. The researchers highlight one, sold by that company to the computer software firm Alteryx, which contained 248 attributes per household for 120 million Americans.The researchers, led by Luc Rocher at UCLouvain, argue their results show that anonymisation is not enough for companies to get around laws such as GDPR (general data protection regulation). “Our results reject the claims that, first, reidentification is not a practical risk and, second, sampling or releasing partial datasets provide plausible deniability.Other approaches for handling large-scale datasets might be more in line with modern data protection needs. Differential privacy, used by companies such as Apple and Uber, deliberately fuzzes every inidual data point in a way that averages out across the dataset, preventing deanonymisation by reporting technically incorrect information for each person.Homomorphic encryption involves encrypting data so it cannot be read but can still be manipulated the results are still encrypted, but can be decrypted once returned to the data controller. And at the far end, synthetic datasets involve training an AI on real, identifiable information, then using it to generate new, fake data points that are statistically identical but do not relate to any real inidual.The research is published in the journal Nature Communications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30b394b9a826f35287526980337e753e00d4f6a/336_148_2747_1648/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25ecef13bec6d6f1e234295aaed226b","title":"10 uk best water sports activities venues aqua park surfing","story":"When the heat is on it’s time to hit the water. From aqua parks and windsurfing to mermaid classes and underwater hockey, here’s our pick of fun things to doBounce, hop, e and jump through Atlantis, a new aqua park at the National Diving and Activity Centre in Chepstow, Monmouthshire. It has five floating zones, each increasing in difficulty, with Total Wipeout-style courses of slides, climbing walls and obstacles (£30pp, under 8s not permitted). The centre also has a flyboarding experience on a water-propelled hover-board (£68pp, 16s and over). Elsewhere, two of the largest inflatable courses in the UK are the New Forest Aquapark (£15), near Frogham (4,000 sq m) and Lagoona Park (from £15pp), near Reading (5,000 sq m). Rutland Water, in the east Midlands (from £20pp), has the UK’s tallest inflatable obstacle, the Rutland Mammoth, with slides or a free fall 5.5-metre drop. Alongside its aqua park and aqua jungle, Windsor’s Liquid Leisure has a head-to-head race course inspired by the Ninja Warrior TV show (from £8pp).Against a backdrop of mountains and forests, Adventure Parc Snowdonia is an inland surf centre in north Wales, with manmade waves across beginner, intermediate and advanced zones (sessions from £35, wetsuit hire from £6 a day). For newbies, lessons are available for ages 5-plus (1½ hours, £40 children, £50 adult). It also has the new Adrenaline Indoors adventure centre, including climbing walls and artificial caving. Opening later in the year, the Wave in Bristol will include a lake with wave-making technology and be able to host 80 surfers at a time in six surfing zones. For more experienced surfers (and spectators), the tidal bore of the River Severn provides another alternative to ocean waves: reaching up to two metres high and more than 12mph as a result of the Atlantic surging into the Bristol Channel and through the estuary (there are several due in August).There’s a great variety of whitewater rafting options in the UK: from Olympic-standard parks to wildlife-rich rivers. For the latter, the River Blackwater on the Northern Irish border has a route with plenty of drops and rapids, but still suitable for beginners. Awol Outdoor Adventure runs instructor-led day trips from £35pp, including kit. One of the UK’s top manmade sites is the Lee Valley White Water Centre, the London 2012 venue. It runs Olympic-course rafting experiences from £39pp. The site also has hydrospeeding (a cross between a float and a bodyboard) around the smaller Legacy Loop (£45pp). Dam-fed waterways are another reliable year-round option: the Welsh National White Water Centre runs taster sessions on the River Tryweryn in Snowdonia, fed by the Llyn Celyn reservoir (£37pp, wetsuit hire £5).Single-fin swimming has become a popular new “sport”, teaching mermaids and mermen free-ing, synchronised swimming and underwater-breathing skills. Dorset’s coast was host to the first UK edition of the Merlympics last year, organised by the team from Mayim Mermaid Academy in Bournemouth – the UK’s longest-running mermaiding school. Its group mermaid lessons take place throughout the summer in Ferndown and Clayesmore (£45pp). Sister mermaid school, Finsplash in Norwich, has sessions every second Sunday (£30pp). Specially-made monofins are provided and sessions are for ages 8+ (but there’s no age limit currently Finsplash’s oldest mermaid is over 60).Canoe camping trips often mean access to secluded areas of the countryside and back-to-basics camping. Canoe the Wye runs a three-day, 42-mile canoe-and-camping adventure on the River Wye from Hereford to Symonds Yat. It explores the Forest of Dean and Wye valley, and includes stops at Hoarwithy and Ross-on-Wye (£195pp, half-day trips, from £60pp). On the Norfolk Broads, there are one- to four-night trips with The Canoe Man (from £188pp), some including a basic-but-atmospheric camping spot next to a wild-swimming site. In the Lake District, Keswick Adventures has a one-night tailor-made canoe expedition for £100pp, minimum of four people.Several of the UK’s many paddleboarding sites offer something a little different. Putting trust into a group of well-balanced friends would be wise for Inspire 2 Aventure’s paddleboarding sessions, in Monmouth, south Wales. Its giant paddleboard, the mega-SUP, has room for up to eight people, who navigate the river as a team (two hours, £25pp). After-dark adventures with Psyched Paddleboarding include head-torches and light-up boards for trips out into a sheltered bay around Anglesey, a designated Dark Skies Reserve (two hours, from £50pp, experience required).Wembury in south Devon is one of the UK’s top rockpooling spots. The Wembury Marine Centre runs sessions for all ages (£3pp) – and keep those eyes peeled for cushion starfish and spawning beadlet anemones. There are several free guided rockpooling sessions on the coast near St Michael’s Mount, in west Cornwall this summer, run by Great Scott! Adventures Outdoors (18 Aug, 1 Sept). Day trips with Coastal Foraging, in Carmarthenshire, include exploring mud flats, rock pools and estuaries around Pendine Sands and St Ishmael for wild ingredients, before cooking them over a fire in a sheltered sea cave (£80pp, £70 if travelling via public transport). ForeAdventure runs half-day seashore foraging courses in Studland on the Jurassic coast in Dorset (£40pp). It also has Forage and Feast sessions (three hours, £70pp), and Kayak, Fish, Forage and Feast (six hours, £120), both include three-course dinner with cocktails and wine. Wild About Pembrokshire runs a variety of family sea foraging courses, with guided walks, coastal picnics and more (from £15 adults, £5 children).West Sussex-based windsurfing and kitesurfing club 2Xs runs taster sessions from its West Wittering base (two hour windsurf tasters £55 ), and a Saturday club for children (7-12), which includes windsurfing, and other water sports (£35 for two hours). The Little Rippers Windsurfing course (for 5-7s) costs £65 for two hours. Scotland’s “sunshine” island of Tiree is one of the UK’s top windsurfing locations. Wild Diamond runs two-hour windsurfing courses here (children £30, adults £35) on flat, shallow Loch Bhasapol. Balinoe Campsite has pitches with views towards Mull and the Treshnish Isles – and a bothy and self-catering house for those reluctant to stay under canvas. Thanks to the exposed coast, the wide, sandy bay of Rhosneigr, on Anglesey’s western shore, is a great place to try windsurfing. FunSport runs lessons on the beach (weather dependent) for beginners, in groups of up to 4 people (£30pp) or one-on-one (£42.50).While Rome may look to ban visitors from taking a dip in its Trevi fountain, the UK has plenty of public paddling sites in cities where it’s possible to cool off for free. Among London’s most popular is Granary Square Fountain in King’s Cross, which is colourfully lit up in the evenings and choreographed to spurt at different heights then there is the Edmond J Safra fountain court in front of Somerset House, the Diana Memorial Fountain in Kensington Gardens, close to the Serpentine, and the V\u0026ampA’s John Madejski Garden Fountains, an oval lake with jets. Elsewhere, there’s Custom House pavement fountain in Belfast Sheffield’s award-winning Peace Gardens and the Mirror Pool in Bradford’s City Park, which is the UK’s largest urban water feature (welcoming paddlers, minus the fountain jets, which are due back on in October).Also known as underwater hockey, this water sport has clubs all over the UK and even its own governing body, the British Octopush Association. It was invented in the early 1950s by “sub-aqua ers in Southsea who got bored just swimming up and down pool lanes to get fit”. Equipment includes a mask, snorkel, fins and water polo hat. Players in teams of 10 hold a small stick in a gloved hand to push a 1.2kg puck into a tray at either end of a 25-metre pool. Most of the 120 BOA clubs in the UK run free taster sessions at local pools, including sessions for juniors.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Where are the drawbacks?Morning has broken, like the first morning, in Darvell, Sussex. The sun is shining, the air is full of birdsong and the scent of flowers. A bell rings and healthy-looking children, some barefoot, scamper happily off to school. The youngest are pushed around in wooden carts. Everyone is smiling and going about their business, taking washing to the central laundry or going to work in the workshops, offices or the kitchen garden. No one owns anything or earns anything. Everything is shared and everyone is very friendly. “Good morning,” they say, in a range of accents – British, American, some more Germanic-sounding ones among the older folk.And it does appear to be just that: a very good morning. Unless you take issue with the fact that the women here dress a bit like handmaids, with long shapeless skirts and head coverings (the men, mainly in plain jeans and shirts, look more contemporary, albeit untroubled by fashion). Or you’re bothered that same-sex relationships are a sin around here. Or perhaps you find it all a bit creepy or (whisper it) culty.I’m spending 24 hours with the Bruderhof, a radical Christian movement founded a century ago in Germany. In brief, it recognises the Bible’s authority over everything, placing emphasis on the New Testament’s Acts 2 and 4 and the Sermon on the Mount, which direct followers to embrace communal living and lifelong service to others. In its 100-year history, the group has moved around – Europe, Paraguay, North America – fleeing Nazis and wars. Now there are 3,000 or so living in communities worldwide, including some 300 here in the Weald. They have let the cameras in, for a BBC documentary, to show the world what they do. They might as well let the press in, too hence my presence.I am met at the station in a communal Volkswagen Golf by Bernard, 38, who might be called something like outreach director if the Bruderhof did titles. He lives with his wife, Rachel, 46, and their children, Esther, Michael and Jonathan (14, 12 and five) in a wing of the central building, which was once a TB hospital. I’m staying with them.For tea, after thanking the Lord, we have bacon rolls – from pigs raised on the premises – and salad, and they tell me about themselves. Rachel is from Connecticut, Bernard is British. They grew up and met within the community and were married in a field after a courtship that involved a lot of letter writing, discussion of the gospels and taking advice from pastors.They have had a couple of arguments in their time together. “One was about whether we should go for a walk when Esther was screaming as a baby,” says Rachel. That doesn’t sound too serious. “It was for us. It was devastating that we were arguing for the first time in our lives.”Rachel isn’t wearing a headscarf at home, just a long black skirt and a grey top. Does she not mind looking like a 19th-century peasant? “My identity isn’t defined by what I’m wearing, my freedom isn’t dictated by choosing the latest fashion of the high street,” she says. “What truly makes a woman free: is it choosing their clothing, or is it her personality and character?” She says she covers her head outside not because it’s the law laid down by men, but because Christ said she should when in prayer – and a lot of the day she is in prayer.But do the women look after the kids and chop the vegetables? Mostly, admits Rachel. “I don’t mind that I choose that as a Christian. My view is that men and women have different roles, but neither is superior.”There’s no TV in the house, no computers or tablets. What happens after tea? How about a gin and tonic? Oh, go on then! My kind of cul ... community. Bernard makes three large ones, and we have a quiz. Subject: life outside.Has 14-year-old Esther heard of Love Island? “Is that the one where they all go to the island and then they all have to sleep in a bed together?” Correct. She has never seen it, but a friend outside the community told her about it. Taylor Swift? Nope.Tory leadership, Trump, Brexit: all up to speed. “I think it’s really important to know what’s going on in the world,” says Rachel. “We are a part of it.” Brexit is going to affect them – the business exports, plus there may well be migration issues. “Celebrity culture is one of the things I’m perfectly happy my children know nothing about,” says Bernard. And Instagram. “The majority of parents I speak to are pretty unhappy about the effects of social media.”What about 12-year-old Michael. Would he like a TV? “A tiny bit, yeah,” he admits. He likes playing football, and sometimes gets to watch clips in the office, but doesn’t support a team.And Jonathan? At five, he can swim 500 metres in the community lake (which contains trout and carp). And he’s interested in the Antarctic, loves penguins. He sings a song about emperor penguins and everyone joins in: “To keep myself off the ice  I find my father’s feet are nice  I snuggle in his belly fluff  And that’s how I stay warm enough.” The Bruderhof do a lot of singing.I need to go to bed before I sign up. Up a wooden staircase into a comfortable room with a selection of German prayer books and a big bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk. They’re definitely trying to get me.I’m awoken by the braying of a donkey, and the sun. Breakfast is at 6.15 – more bacon, scrambled eggs, beans and a song. Then it’s off with Michael to feed Olivia the pig and her 12 piglets. Michael does it three times a day, willingly. I wonder if it would be possible to get my own boys to do something useful, three times a day, including before school? Ha! Not without material incentives.Michael likes doing it, he says. Perhaps he’s thinking ahead to when the pigs are feeding him. The Bruderhof may be pacifists, but they do enjoy their bacon.Now it’s my turn to work, in the workshop of Community Playthings, their company that designs and manufactures wooden classroom and play environments for schools and nurseries. Annual turnover is about £17m. I work with Bernard, assembling trapezoidal tables. “We’ll pay you the same as us: six-figure salary, all zeros,” says Bernard. Bit of a joker, is Bernard.Here’s Troy, who’s about to head off to Thailand to help Rohingya refugees. And Corwyn, putting together a table before opening his dentist’s surgery. And Jacob from Iraq, who used to be a Catholic, repented on the frontline in the war with Iran, became a secret pacifist, slyly not shooting anyone, and then fled Iraq just before the first Gulf war and eventually found home with the Bruderhof.No women in the workshop this morning? There will be some later, after nine, says Bernard. “So they can be at home, clean the house first.” He’s not joking, this time.I’m sent over to the polytunnels, to train tomatoes with a softly spoken man named Darius. He speaks like an American, but studied horticulture in Kent. It seems less important for the Bruderhof where they are from and more important that they are somewhere serving Christ. They get moved around depending on communities’ needs, so if Sannerz in Germany needs a builder or a doctor, and Spring Valley in Pennsylvania has a spare, they will move.Lunch is communal in the huge hall. But first, a song! I’m enjoying the singing, and the food, too – grilled chicken with rice. Beside me, five-year-old Jonathan happily eats his broccoli. How do they do that? Maybe he just doesn’t know that children don’t like greens.A letter is read out from a volunteer working with migrants on Mexico’s northern border. Then a few verses from John 3, which encapsulates what the Bruderhof are about. This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Down on the sports field, after the day’s work is done, there are communal games. I’m involved in a big game of kickball – basically rounders, only played with a football, which you kick. There are five-year-olds and 75-year-olds on my team, generations brought together by a shared vision. It’s a lovely scene – a bunch of people untroubled by money and mortgages and material matters, enjoying themselves and looking after each other.God (sorry), if I could just look past those issues – the homosexuality one, and the women looking like the one in Grant Wood’s American Gothic. Would it get claustrophobic, living and working with the same people, and with all that goodwill and kindness? I’d miss a bit of cynicism, gossip, a tiny bit of wickedness.But then I meet Bärbel and Rahel, sisters, aged 83 and 74, who are of German heritage but spent their childhood in Paraguay. It was tough there was never enough to eat. Now they have it too good, says Bärbel. Why aren’t they playing kickball? “Such a silly game,” scoffs Rahel. “I like to laugh at them when they make mistakes.”A hint of humour and defiance. It is possible. Then someone hands me a hot dog from the barbecue and a big glass of (excellent) homebrewed beer. OK, sold, I’m in. Where do I sign?• Inside the Bruderhof is on BBC One on 25 July at 10.35pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4246f6e7295b1665385a520b8c8b4e2c67e06cd3/0_0_4372_2624/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e5ffda1b8a1de3ef256b450775c9f96","title":"keeping faith series two review return of the mac","story":"The BBC’s word-of-mouth smash goes primetime ... and now, there’s been a murder in deepest WalesFirst things first: the yellow mac has not gone for good, even if it does seem to have been usurped by a sharp blue trench coat for much of this episode. That fans have come to care so deeply about an item of practical outerwear, with the same fervour as they might once have coveted Sarah Lund’s knits, says a lot about Keeping Faith, which returns for a second series riding high on the crest of its word-of-mouth success.Filmed and broadcast in both Welsh and English, the noirish thriller proved so popular last year that the BBC were forced to extend its run on iPlayer, and it became the most-watched ‘non-network’ show on the site. So here it is, inevitably bumped to primetime BBC One, where fans might finally find out what the perplexing end of the first series meant, and newcomers might jump in and discover what they’ve been missing.Eve Myles is Faith Howells, a solicitor who lives in a picturesque Welsh village, which means we’re in for a lot of coastal driving, usually in slow motion, while everyone thinks about what’s going on. The first series saw Faith struggling with the mother of all bad weeks, when her husband, Evan, vanished after leaving for work one morning, setting off a chain of terrible events. And then, he came back, the credits rolled, and viewers were left to wonder where the hell he’d been all series.This opening episode splits its time between the present day and that night, 18 months ago, when Evan returned to explain what he’d been doing. Those frustrated by the open-endedness of series one will find great satisfaction in how Faith gets the truth out of him. She ushers him into a room, bottle of wine in hand, and you’re unsure whether she’s going to glug it or slug him with it. She doesn’t use the wine bottle, but it doesn’t turn out well for Evan, either.Myles does a knockout job as Faith, who spends much of her time glowering in the rearview mirror of her car, or behind the reflection of something else in one of many arty, blurry shots or moody montages. Her don’t-mess attitude – and the fact that she isn’t squeaky clean herself – is the main driving force behind the show. But it is also very good at building intrigue, and laying breadcrumbs, and it packs an awful lot in to an hour. Newcomers should be able to jump in cold (there’s a scene that essentially recaps the first series’ many dodgy dealings, though it comes near the end), but it helps if you have some idea why Faith is in debt, why everyone is so keen to buy an energy company at a knockdown price, and what has driven Alys to her “halfway to goth” experimentations in eyeliner and dark lipstick.Given that Evan’s whereabouts have been accounted for, and he’s currently halfway through a four-year prison sentence, there needs to be a new mystery for Faith to get stuck into. As soon as that blue trench makes an appearance, it’s clear she means business. Keeping Faith is about to go Full Broadchurch with a murder case, when local farmer Will Vaughan is found dead, having been shot in the chest, and his wife Madlen is suspected of the crime, because her fingerprints are all over the gun. Naturally, Faith steps up to offer help, even though Tom points out she’s never actually handled a murder case. “Let this be the first,” she says, gamely, which is exactly the phrase you’d never want to hear from a pilot, a surgeon, or a lawyer defending you in a murder trial. When Madlen is charged with the crime, Faith does the reasonable thing and shouts “You bastards! What is wrong with you people?” at the detective who just charged her client. I am sure it will all go well.When it comes to family, though, Faith is in charge. When she tells Evan, “I’ll sort it”, there is no doubting she means what she says. Her woman-scorned determination is what will save her, in the short run, but there’s also a worry, now, that it could eventually bring her down. This is not drama with a particularly light touch, but that really doesn’t matter, given that it rips along at an irresistible pace. In an age of cinematic telly, or literary telly, Keeping Faith is telly-telly, and it is all the better for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce58005f445ba5268e5e2dcfaa4d9517678ea225/99_375_4653_2792/master/4653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0861bbda273bc7221f5387d947f99f","title":"perverts in bushes ruining nude zone paris park say naturists","story":"Users of Bois de Vincennes claim peace is being disturbed by voyeurs and exhibitionistsNaturists in a Paris park have complained that voyeurs and exhibitionists are spoiling their naked enjoyment.The nudists say they are being pestered in an area of the city’s Bois de Vincennes where for the last two years they have been allowed to shed their clothes.An area of almost two acres of the park is set aside for naturists between April and October. When it opened in 2017, City officials insisted no inappropriate behaviour would be tolerated, a message reiterated on a sign at the entrance to the zone.But a number of naturists have complained their peace is being disturbed by the “reprehensible” actions of some non-nudists.One, Bernard, told Le Monde: “Voyeurs and exhibitionists come and bother the women … of course they are afraid.” He added: “Sometimes there’s a police unit that comes by but if they don’t catch anyone in flagrant délit, they can’t punish anyone.”Others complained of “perverts hiding in bushes”.The local mayor, Catherine Baratti-Elbaz, said police had been asked to increase park patrols after reports of “voyeurism and exhibitionism”, but the police commissioner, Hugo Arer, said he had not received any formal complaints this year.Laurent Luft, the president of the Paris Naturists’ Association, who was involved in choosing the Bois de Vincennes site as a naturist zone, said the problems were being exaggerated.“After I heard of these complaints I spoke to a male friend who goes to this naturist area every single day he told me he’d never seen any sordid activity or activities that don’t correspond to the idea of naturism,” he said.He admitted the experience might be different for women. “If I was a woman I’m not sure if I’d go there, but lots of my female friends do. Any nudist area like a beach, or even an ordinary beach where there are women in bikinis, will attract an element of frustrated men.”France is one of the world’s leading naturist destinations with 4.7 million nudists, 2.1 million of them French, according to the French Federation of Naturism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab05a948fcc75a920921b91c15598ae447867858/0_64_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a2ec57e20bda3af0806adc7e04d655d","title":"philippines libel trial of maria ressa journalist critical of president duterte begins","story":"Maria Ressa faces prison term if convicted under criminal cyberlibel lawA libel trial against the editor of Rappler, a Philippine news site critical of the regime of President Rodrigo Duterte, has begun in a case widely seen as an attempt by the government to intimidate journalists and curtail press freedom.Maria Ressa was arrested and held overnight in February on charges of cyberlibel for a story published by Rappler in 2012, before being released on bail. She described the charges as “preposterous and baseless”.In a statement on Tuesday, the first day of the trial, Ressa said: “This case of cyberlibel stretches the rule of law until it breaks.”She said: “How this is decided will have an impact on all Filipinos who post on Facebook – and of course, the quality of journalism in the digital age in the Philippines.”It was the eleventh time in 18 months that Ressa had been hit with criminal charges relating to Rappler, in what many believe is a targeted, government-led witch-hunt against the news organisation.Rappler, which is one of the most influential news sites in the Philippines, has also been one of the most critical of Duterte’s administration since he took power in 2016. In particular, it has scrutinised his government over the brutal war on drugs, which officially has taken more than 5,300 lives, though human rights groups allege the true figure is more than double that.In response, Duterte has repeatedly described Rappler’s journalism as “fake news” and his government has hit Rappler and Ressa with a multitude of criminal charges, ranging from being illegally foreign-owned, to tax evasion and failing to file tax returns, all of which Ressa says are “trumped up” and an attempt to attack and intimidate critical journalists.The cyberlibel charge relates to a story published on Rappler’s website in May 2012 that alleged ties between a Philippine businessman, Wilfredo D Keng, and a high court judge. However, as Ressa and her legal counsel have pointed out, the controversial cyberlibel law under which she is being prosecuted was enacted four months after the story was written.The cyberlibel case was first brought in 2017, but initially dismissed by the national bureau of investigation. However, despite no new evidence, it was mysteriously reopened in 2018 and allowed to proceed to trial by the department of justice (DOJ).Specifically in order to charge Ressa, the DOJ extended the liability period for cyberlibel cases from one to12 years.Tuesday’s brief hearing, which Ressa did not attend, ended after testimony from two minor witnesses who were brought in by the DOJ, with the case set to resume on 30 July.Ressa’s refusal to bow to pressure from the Duterte administration has won her accolades around the world. She was among those named Time person of the year 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award and this year’s prestigious press freedom award, given by the Committee to Protect Journalists.This month it was also announced that Amal Clooney had joined the team defending Ressa against the charges. “Maria Ressa is a courageous journalist who is being persecuted for reporting the news and standing up to human rights abuses,” Clooney said in a statement.Over Duterte’s three years in power, press freedom has severely declined. Reporters Without Borders ranked the Philippines at 134 out of 178 countries in its press freedom index and its report cited at least three journalists who had been killed “most likely by agents working for local politicians”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231282f1ac177f5f5a049f482279e5417711db20/0_104_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2971aea12a9e73f2c2a23334c1f171a6","title":"venezuela blackouts new normal","story":"Country struggled to restore power after massive blackout on Monday left millions without powerWidespread electricity outages could become the new normal in Venezuela, experts have warned, as the country struggled to restore power after a massive blackout that left millions without power or access to the internet.But energy analysts were deeply suspicious of government claims, arguing instead that years of corruption and mismanagement have eroded Venezuela’s energy capacity.“This blackout is the result of negligent mis-operation of the power grid,” said José Aguilar, a Venezuelan energy and risk consultant based in the US. “These will keep happening and it will get worse before it gets better.”Other analysts express similar incredulity. “It’s hard to believe that it was an electromagnetic attack, when you’ve seen years of theft and corruption in the energy sector,” said Geoff Ramsey, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America. “This blackout shows government doesn’t have the tools to return to normalcy.”Some supporters of Nicolás Maduro have claimed that US sanctions aimed at Venezuela’s oil industry have hampered his government’s ability to keep the lights on, but many of those sanctions target iniduals accused corruption.A wave of nationwide blackouts struck Venezuela in March helped drive support for Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who is heading a movement to unseat Maduro.Guaidó swore himself in as president in January, but although he counts on the backing of the US and dozens of other western states, he has been unable to force Maduro from power, and public support for his campaign has run into headwinds.“Popular sentiment goes against politicians that cannot resolve the country’s problems,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, an analyst. “That goes for the whole political class.”Guaidó is set to hold a rally on Tuesday morning in Caracas, where he is likely to address the blackouts.“They tried to hide the tragedy by rationing supplies across the country, but their failure is evident,” Guaidó tweeted on Monday night. “They destroyed the system and they don’t have answers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says incoming UK PM \u0026lsquofailed to show\u0026rsquo understanding\u0026rsquo of Belfast AgreementJohnson as prime minister \u0026lsquoraises enormous fears\u0026rsquo for Anglo-Irish relations \u0026ndash MartinMolly Sloyan rented house, hired car and bought chemicals for sophisticated operationNoyek awarded \u0026euro44,000 in damages after minor impact collisionLatest statistics show number of dogs entering local authority pounds also fallingMinister of State Andrew Doyle has asked former chief planner with Scottish Government to do studyCouple owe \u0026euro1.2m mortgage debt on Clontarf home which they had agreed to leave by July 9thLack of clarity over research activity may prove \u0026lsquoproblematic\u0026rsquo in future reviewsCourt heard incident at Dublin school was followed by a second assault by same teacher three days laterCelebrant speaks of deceased\u0026rsquos resilience in wake of the death of his son and his brotherBundoran closed over pollution on the beach while bathing restrictions put in place at WatervilleJudge stuck out criminal damage charge saying to be trapped in a lift is a very frightening experienceCourt heard a cold bottle of wine had been used on boy\u0026rsquos wounds to cool them down during flightIsland Capital Management to waive privilege over documentVaradkar says he will not remove whip from Fine Gael TD, conscious of \u0026lsquodevastating effect\u0026rsquo of sagaLocal hero Miche\u0026aacutel Mulcahy saved the life of Michael Downes from New York in 1963Victim, who was in bed with boyfriend at time, said what happened had left her feeling angry, ashamed, worthless and dirtyPaul O\u0026rsquoBeirne and Jeffrey Morrow remanded in custody for sentencing at end of monthSewer pipe collapse causes partial drainage of canal between locks on Suir RoadPsychiatric nurses\u0026rsquo overtime ban will have significant impact on patients , HSE warns"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3965156.1563909743!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave in france an overpowering smell of rubbish and avoiding the oven","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople cool off at the Trocadero Fountains in Paris. Photograph: Alain JocardGettyParis feels like it’s burning, for the second time in a month: 37 degrees on Tuesday, 38 on Wednesday and a whopping 42 on Thursday. The last time I experienced heat that intense was in Baghdad.Thursday’s peak is expected to break the previous record for the French capital of 40.4 degrees, set in 1947.“Temperatures will be stifling in big towns at night, about 25 degrees,” Frédéric Nathan, a forecaster for Météo France, told France Info radio.Last month, temperatures in the southern Gard department reached 46 degrees, another French record.In the circumstances, you might expect climate change sceptics to shut up. But no, conservative and far-right deputies in the National Assembly boycotted a speech by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old passionara of the fight against global warming, before a non-partisan parliamentary group on Tuesday. They called her the “prophetess in short trousers”, the “guru of the apocalypse” and “laureate of the Nobel fear prize”. The deputies, Thunberg replied, “are more afraid of me than of the real problem”.Earlier this month, scientists from the World Weather Attribution project reported a direct link between climate change and heat waves, which are now “at least” five times more frequent than in 1947.Eighty of France’s 96 mainland departments were on heat wave “orange alert” on Tuesday, a record. New temperature records were set in Bordeaux, Angers, Rennes and Blois. Three-quarters of France has been forced to restrict the consumption of water because a 20 per cent drop in rainfall has created a drought. In parts of France, it hasn’t rained for a month. Streams are running dry. The electricity company has stopped two nuclear power plants because the river water used as coolant is too hot.Temperatures this week are roughly equivalent to the 2003 heatwave, though the 2003 heatwave lasted longer. According to the health and medical research institute Inserm, it caused 19,490 deaths in France, mostly among the elderly, and close to 70,000 across Europe.Those early deaths were attributed to official negligence. No government has been caught out since. The authorities provide air conditioned community rooms, leave parks open at night and set up temporary fountains and mist machines. The ministry of health has a toll-free heatwave hotline. Volunteers call on elderly citizens to make sure they drink enough water.Because high temperatures raise ozone levels, only the least polluting vehicles are allowed to circulate.Walking around the city in daylight hours, one feels as if one is being irradiated. The heat magnifies bad odours. Paris is still beautiful, but the smell of urine and garbage can be overpowering.I stocked up on mineral water, ice cream, sorbet, gazpacho, taking care not to buy anything that requires lighting the oven. I’ve adopted the routine my mother taught me, on the edge of the Californian desert. I open all windows at night, close them and draw the curtains in early morning.My greatest concern is for Spike, my frail, 19-year-old Irish moggy with his thick fur coat. During the 2015 heatwave, Spike had an epileptic fit. It was terrifying to watch my friend bob across the floor with bulging eyes. I pleaded with the vet to come quickly, and he injected Spike with water. Now I serve him chilled water from the fridge several times a day, and keep an electric fan pointed at him.I obtained the concierge’s blessing to move Spike to the ground floor entry, which is cooler, before the thermostat hits 40. I’ll take him down in the morning with his litter tray, food, water, rug and fan. My neighbours have all fled the city, so I will leave the door of the apartment open. Spike can wander upstairs if he gets lonely.I experienced a previous record-breaking drought and heatwave, in the summer of 1976, with the insouciance of a teenager on her first great adventure.

When someone craves such public attention and adulation all the time, there can only be space for one person and their ego in that relationship.Writer Rebecca Reid criticised the public nature of the proposal in an article for Grazia magazine.Edgaras Averbuchas, 27, was accused of \u0026#34bad form\u0026#34 after he asked his girlfriend of nine years to marry him during her graduation ceremony The chances are that this couple are very much in love, and that she was delighted with the proposal,” she wrote. “But what was she supposed to do if she\u0027d wanted to say no? Break his heart in front of an entire auditorium full of strangers?Hijacking a big moment with something sweet or well intentioned doesn\u0027t make it okay. Just because something is sweet or well intended doesn\u0027t mean that it is appropriate.“Years of hard work and now we\u0027re all supposed to be pleased for her. Not because of her achievement, but because she got her man. Bad form,” one Twitter user complained. However the Lithuanian couple, who met as teenagers at secondary school in their home town of Vilnius, rejected the suggestion that the gesture was outdated, with Miss Banuskeviciute saying she was “extremely happy” with the “amazing proposal”. That\u0027s so strange that Edgaras was getting a lot of criticism from people. I think that this day became even more beautiful with this proposal,” she said. I remember myself standing on the stage. I was a little bit nervous, but extremely happy.Then, all of a sudden I saw Edgaras coming, but everything happened so quickly that it took me some time to understand what actually happened.He knelt on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was in so much shock and of course I said yes.Everyone cheered and it was an amazing proposal which truly took me by surprise.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand have also announced a crackdown on plastic imports as they attempt to stem the tide of waste from European countries which are unable or unwilling to dispose of it themselves.Rohan Masakorala, a Sri Lankan businessman, was identified as the importer of the containers on Tuesday but has denied any wrongdoing and insists no human remains were inside. However, a spokesman for Sri Lanka’s Central Environment Authority said: “The waste material brought to the country under the guise of mattresses from the UK is extremely hazardous.”British waste disposal experts said disguising human remains as recyclable metals would be highly lucrative as it is illegal to export anatomical waste, such as human organs or body parts. Someone is making a killing out of this, warned Dominic Hogg, the chairman of waste and recycling consultancy Eunomia. “There is a major financial incentive to this, with hazardous material, because it was likely taken on the basis of being paid a lot of money to ensure it was disposed of correctly. You would potentially double your money if it were body parts or clinical waste.A spokesman for the British Metals Recycling Association said it “absolutely condemns” illegal exports of hazardous waste, which it blamed on a minority of rogue traders and criminals. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, containers are generally only opened by port officials if there is intelligence to suggest an illegal shipment is being attempted we believe this results in just one in 1,000 containers being searched,” added Howard Bluck, the association’s technical director. Sri Lanka customs on July 23 ordered the return of container loads of hazardous mortuary and clinical waste illegally imported from the UKIf the presence of British human remains in the containers is confirmed, it is feared they may have originated from NHS hospitals which are struggling to dispose of anatomical waste. Last year, the Health Service Journal revealed that private contractor Healthcare Environment Services Ltd (HES) had stockpiled human waste from 50 NHS trusts, including amputated limbs, human organs and infectious liquid.  HES lost all of its waste contracts and closed down in December last year, following the disclosure. The excess waste levels had exceeded 350 tonnes in September, five times the 70 tonnes limit, with the remains being stored in fridges.Garry Pettigrew, the company’s former director, has vehemently denied any involvement with the Sri Lankan exports and claimed in a message on Twitter that NHS contractors were illegally shipping the waste abroad.   It would not be the first time British waste has been implicated in a scandal over illegal exports and disposal methods. The  revealed last year that a trash mafia operating in Poland was paid millions of euros to import plastic waste from the UK and set it alight in a field near the rural town of Zgierz.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Under the proposals, employers would be obliged to take steps to cool workplaces down once the temperature hits 24C.Currently there’s no law for minimum or maximum working temperatures but employers must ensure temperatures are “reasonable” while separate guidelines recommend 16C as a minimum.The Met Office predicts temperatures will rise to 37C\u0026nbspin parts of the UK on Thursday, higher than the July record of 36.7C.The all-time UK record of 38.5C, set in Faversham in August 2003, is also “under threat”.However the soaring temperatures – caused by the jet stream pushing hot air up from southern Europe – will pose a health risk to vulnerable groups, such as older people and infants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is not expected to happen until iOS 13, which was unveiled earlier this summer and will be fully released in September, but is available in an early version now.Instead, the new update brings a host of small tweaks and security updates intended to make iPhones and iPads safer.However, hiding beneath those relatively mundane updates are two features that could change the way iPhone users interact with their phones.First among them is a new iPhone migration tool, which is intended to help people when they get a new phone. The feature allows a new phone to be placed next to the old one and have all the data transfer over, allowing devices to be quickly set up.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The new feature is described as a tool aimed at giving users\u0026nbspthe ability to wirelessly transfer data and migrate directly from an old iPhone to a new iPhone during setup, according to the release notes.New iPhone could include different Apple logo, rumour suggestsBut perhaps the most significant change is completely hidden to users. References to the Apple Card have been found in the beta version of iOS 12.4, and so the release of this version is expected to bring those same changes.That could mean that the card – which was unveiled in March without a release date – could finally be coming to the public. Until now, Apple has only offered the option to sign up to receive updates in the future.As well as the new changes, the latest update also brings back the Walkie-Talkie feature to the Apple Watch. That was pulled earlier this month when it was discovered that the Watch could be used to listen in on people, but that problem appears to have been fixed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it doesn’t mean that the island’s couples are set in stone in advance of next Monday’s series closer, with the first glimpse at tonight’s episode setting up yet another potential romance-destroying feud.In the clip provided by ITV2, the romantic tension between Jordan Hames and newcomer India Reynolds sparks outrage in Jordan’s girlfriend Anna Vakili. Over a pair of ice lollies, the “official” item confront the elephant in the room.Created with Sketch. Show all 68Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.168 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.268 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.968 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1068 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1168 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1268 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1468 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1568 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1868 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2068 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2168 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2268 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2468 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2568 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2668 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2768 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2868 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3168 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3268 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3368 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3468 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3668 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3868 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3968 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4068 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4168 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4268 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4468 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4568 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4768 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4868 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4968 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5068 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5168 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5268 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5368 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5668 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5868 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6068 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6168 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 6268 Ovie kisses new girl IndiaOvie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris6368 Michael finally admits he still likes AmberAfter spending weeks vehemently denying it, Michael eventually pulled Amber aside to tell her he still had feelings for her. 6468 Amber recouples with GregAmber was forced to choose between old flame Michael and new romance Greg. “It’s hard choosing whether to go with your heart or your head… it’s been hard,” she said, before choosing Irish rugby player Greg. 6568 Francesca savages Michael in her recoupling speechAfter Amber chose Greg, Francesca was left with only one man to choose from - Michael. She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6668 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6768 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa. Michael left on a good note with Amber, admitting he wasn’t “the nicest person” over the past few weeks and saying he was happy to see Amber getting on well with Greg. 6868 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couplesIslanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis’ relationship “staged,” that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that “bored” Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.168 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.268 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him.

Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3268 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3368 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3468 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3668 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3868 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3968 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4068 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4168 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4268 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4468 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4568 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4768 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4868 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4968 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5068 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5168 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5268 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5368 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5668 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5868 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6068 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6168 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 6268 Ovie kisses new girl IndiaOvie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris6368 Michael finally admits he still likes AmberAfter spending weeks vehemently denying it, Michael eventually pulled Amber aside to tell her he still had feelings for her. 6468 Amber recouples with GregAmber was forced to choose between old flame Michael and new romance Greg. “It’s hard choosing whether to go with your heart or your head… it’s been hard,” she said, before choosing Irish rugby player Greg. 6568 Francesca savages Michael in her recoupling speechAfter Amber chose Greg, Francesca was left with only one man to choose from - Michael. She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6668 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6768 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa. Michael left on a good note with Amber, admitting he wasn’t “the nicest person” over the past few weeks and saying he was happy to see Amber getting on well with Greg. 6868 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couplesIslanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis’ relationship “staged,” that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that “bored” Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.“I just wanna have fun with you,” Jordan tells Anna. “And I feel like maybe we lost that a little bit.” In response, Anna fires back: “The first hurdle we’ve come to because we’re not having much fun together – and you avoid me?”Here’s everything you need to know about the Love Island finalJordan to leave Anna for India? Love Island has jumped the sharkThe four biggest talking points from the latest episode of Love IslandLater on, Maura Higgins naturally throws a cat among the pigeons by letting Anna know that Jordan has been expressing interest in India, leading Anna to immediately confront her love interest in front of the rest of the Islanders.“Do you like her?” Anna asks. “Yes or no? … You just asked me out and you like her? Is that how much of a f***ing idiot you are?”“I’m having a conversation,” Jordan explains, his excuse appearing to fall on deaf ears.Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That wonky amount of interest threatens to eclipse the way we think about the moon and space exploration more generally.This was the week that the Indian space agency sent a mission that should be the first time the country will\u0026nbspconduct\u0026nbspa soft landing onto the lunar surface. And while that achievement will be a rare one, it won’t be unique: India\u0026nbspwill become the fourth country to do so, after the\u0026nbspUS, the\u0026nbspformer Soviet Union\u0026nbspand China.The moon landing anniversary received far more attention, but the US didn’t actually do anything new to merit all of the excitement. Getting to the lunar surface is of course an achievement – it might be\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspachievement of human history – but it is also one that happened 50 years ago, in another age.The week was filled up with some new announcements about the US government and Nasa’s plans to head back to the moon, including an announcement by Mike Pence that the Orion capsule that could one day carry astronauts back to the lunar surface is ready for final testing.

It gets to fundamental questions of who owns the moon, and how we should treat the new place we come across.The moon will be an incredibly valuable resource in years to come: not only does it remain a valuable object of study in itself, it is likely to serve as a stopping-off point that could make travel further into the solar system much easier. As such, it will become yet another resource for the world to fight over.As the space race hots up, that fighting is likely to rhyme with the bloody\u0026nbsphistory of colony and empire. The US seems to believe it ought to have supremacy\u0026nbspbillionaires are eyeing it as a possible escape from the dangers at home –\u0026nbspclimate change –\u0026nbspwhich threaten\u0026nbspall of Earth.How Nasa plans to put a US flag on Mars by 2033Other launches like those from China and India offer a way out of this depressing repetition, as the world fights to control valuable resources all over again. It is worth turning our attention to those other space agencies – in the hope that this time around it could be different.It would be a mistake, however, to think that having different countries in the race mean it will go any differently: it is just as likely that this time around we have different countries fighting, but all to the same selfish and rapacious ends. We should be even more ambitious, and try and change the race rather than the runners.I despair over how little has changed since the moon landingBoris Johnson claims moon landing proves he can deliver BrexitThe moon landing means everything to aspiring astronauts like meNasa and Apollo veterans are helping the push back to the moonRather than history and the achievements of decades gone by, we might do better to think a little more about science fiction. Authors like Becky Chambers have shown that, in her words, space is for everyone Kim Stanley Robinson has written about the\u0026nbspdangers of trying to ignore that fact and simply recreating our current geopolitical difficulties on a new world.The moon is an unbelievable, magic, alien world that offers the opportunity to change how we live and what we value. But so far it looks as if we are treating it with the same combination of acquisitiveness and disregard that the western world has treated any other place that could be a\u0026nbsppossible colony.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under the proposals, employers would be obliged to take steps to cool workplaces down once the temperature hits 24C.Currently there’s no law for minimum or maximum working temperatures but employers must ensure temperatures are “reasonable” while separate guidelines recommend 16C as a minimum.The Met Office predicts temperatures will rise to 37C\u0026nbspin parts of the UK on Thursday, higher than the July record of 36.7C.The all-time UK record of 38.5C, set in Faversham in August 2003, is also “under threat”.However the soaring temperatures – caused by the jet stream pushing hot air up from southern Europe – will pose a health risk to vulnerable groups, such as older people and infants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are our waters and we will protect them.”He repeated Tehran’s claim that the British had committed “piracy” over the seizure of the Grace 1 supertanker by the authorities in Gibraltar two weeks ago on suspicion that it was transporting oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions. That seems to have led to the retaliation against the\u0026nbspStena\u0026nbspImpero.Mr Zarif accused the UK of carrying out the policies of the US hawks led by John Bolton which Tehran has dubbed the B-team.Jeremy Hunt announces joint European task force to protect UK shipsPompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’Iran sentences ‘CIA spies’ to death Iran heard threatening tanker in newly released radio exchangeHe said: “We are responsible for security and freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.“That is our lifeline and it is much, much better for the United Kingdom not to be engaged in implementing the ploys of the B-team.“The B-team is losing ground in the United States and now they are turning their attention to the United Kingdom.“I guess the same policies that failed in the US will fail in the United Kingdom.”Mr Hunt\u0026nbsptold MPs on Monday that the proposed new European mission would focus on ensuring free navigation through one of the world’s most important waterways, which carries a fifth of the world’s oil and a quarter of its liquefied natural gas flow.It would seek to “complement” US proposals to protect shipping in the region, although it would not form part of the American “maximum pressure” policy on Tehran as the UK continued to support the Iran nuclear deal which the US has repudiated.“It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing this increased international presence in the Gulf, because the focus of our diplomacy has been on de-escalating tensions in the hope that such changes would not be necessary,” Mr Hunt said.He added: “If Iran continues on this dangerous path, they must accept the price will be a larger western military presence in the waters along their coastline, not because we wish to increase tensions but simply because freedom of navigation is a principle which Britain and its allies will always defend.”Meanwhile, the head of the US Central Command said a US Navy ship might have brought down a second Iranian drone in the Strait last week.On Thursday, the US said a Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.“We are confident we brought down one drone, we may have brought down a second,” General Kenneth McKenzie told CBS News in an interview.Additional reporting by agenciesStraight of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drt and the dither and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we’ve seen so far.“I want to lead us out of this mess.”The Tory leadership frontrunner sparked controversy when he announced during an interview with Sky that he believed the abortion limit should be halved.This would be from the current  weeks, down to .

The dog hasnt been seen since.And it might sound ridiculous, but I believe it wont be long before a baby becomes the next victim of Britains increasingly aggressive seagulls.As a councillor and former mayor of Worcester - where the vicious and brassy flying rats have waged war on residents in recent years - I have witnessed first-hand the problems the UK-wide epidemic is causing.One shop owner told me hed seen a gull ferociously attack a young child in a pushchair, while a constituent emailed to say her dog had been attacked - just like Gizmo the chihuahua.Elsewhere in Britain, elderly couple Roy and Brenda Pickard were reported to have been held hostage in their own home by gulls for six days last month after two chicks slipped on to the canopy directly above their door.Roy, , ended up in hospital with head injuries after being attacked by one of the birds.The truth is, people and animals up and down the country are being victimised by these gulls - some of which have been known to grow as big as dog.And at this time of year, theyre more violent than ever, as their chicks get ready to flee the nest.Its led me to one, brutal, conclusion: We must kill the bloody things.Britain is a country of animal lovers and I know some people will find my suggestion horrying. But hear me out.Seagulls are traditionally coast-dwelling birds: a day trip to the seaside would inevitably involve a throng of the sharp-beaked birds, desperate to steal a chip or your ice cream.But now theyve taken over densely-populated city streets.They walk casually along the street beside us asthey own the place, ready to pounce on any poor person who dares to eat outside.The statistics are alarming.While the number of gulls at the seaside is declining - blamed on reduced habitats and the decline of the fishing industry leaving food for them to scavenge - in the past  years the number of city gulls have doubled.Experts say the deluge in urban areas is down to hotter summers and milder winters, discarded food waste and buildings providing safe nesting sites for gulls away from predators.Take Birmingham, Nottingham and Westbury in Wiltshire for example: all very much inland, but where residents and tourists have reported being plagued by gulls. In the past few years, doctors have even warned of a spike in patients requiring treatment for seagull bites and gashes.Worcester is also about as far away from the sea as you can get - its  miles from the nearest beach resort, Weston-super-Mare - yet my constituents tell me theyre too frightened to venture into their own gardens for fear of gull attacks.Councils are taking steps to stop this - such as hi-tech gull-proof bins and plastic eggs, which seagulls are encouraged to incubate instead of their own to allow the population to decline naturally.They are forking out hundreds of thousands of pounds trying to tackle the crisis and have even created new jobs .But so far, nothing has worked - at a cost to taxpayers health and safety.Bleeding-heart liberals who hope the problem will simply go away - without offering a viable solution - will tell you that seagulls are cuddly little things who dont deserve to die.But in actual fact, theyre huge - some have been compared to Rottweilers in size.The Royal Society for the Protection of Birdssays there are around , pairs of herring gulls - the best-known type of gull - in the UK during the summer months .Gulls have been been nesting on rooftops since the s.But nearly  years on, the situation has become so dire that people are reportedly having to use umbrellas to shield themselves from gulls - and their acrid droppings - when leaving their homes.Nor is it just a peck people are worried about. The birds beaks are specically designed to pick things up - whether thats the sandwich youre about to tuck into or your beloved pet.In , a group of gulls pecked to death a Yorkshire Terrier as it played in a Cornwall back garden.And as I write this, the fate of Gizmo, the dog supposedly gull-napped this week, remains unknown.Visitors to Grimsby, Lincolnshire, also recently witnessed a psycho gull e-bombing a man, in scenes reminiscent of the Hitchcock film, where birds launch murderous attacks on humans.Some experts say the gulls have become so used to humans that theyre no longer scared of us.And they dont simply pose a health and safety risk.The birds start screeching at about am, then spend their days dropping faeces everywhere - on peoples cars , washing lines, and businesses.Its unsurprising then that tourism is taking a hit.People are avoiding eating at outdoor cafes while business owners in my constituency are coming to work to find their shops blanketed in white droppings.So as the gull infestation continues to spiral out of control, whats the solution It seems to me that the only one is a cull. And Im not alone.A YouGov poll in  found  per cent of Brits tend to support a cull on gulls, compared to  per cent who are opposed - and many consider them to be worse than pigeons.The same year, then-prime minister David Cameron called for a big conversation on the issue following a spate of gull attacks, including one on a pet tortoise, which died days later.So why has nothing been done about it In , Oliver Colvile, then MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, led a parliamentary debate on this countrys murderous seagulls, warning there could be gull wars on our high streets.He called for gull-proof buildings and highlighted the worrying impact on tourism.In Worcester weve tried everything - weve doubled the amount were spending on gull control to £, a year - but nothing is working. The problem is simply getting worse.Some Brits have become so outraged by the havoc theyve armed themselves with guns and taken to the streets to kill the birds. I certainly dont advocate this - and it is, of course, illegal.The RSPB says gulls, like all wild birds, are protected under the Wildle and Countryside Act, so you cant kill or try to control them without a licence.People who do so can face up to six months in prison or a £, fine.This March, tourist John Llewellyn Jones was handed a -week curfew and ordered to pay £ in costs after smashing a seagull to death because it stole his chips.He hurled the bird against a wall in front of horried children in Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset. Obviously, this was a horrendous and cruel attack.Government licences can be granted to allow the professional and humane killing of urban gulls as a last resort where theres a signicant risk to public health or safety.And, from where Im standing, there definitely is one.Yes, some people might think a cull is just as cruel .But with a licence, it would be done properly.If you or I were carrying out the same sorts of behaviours that gulls do every day then wed be arrested. Yet these birds can do it with impunity.As far as Im concerned, these rats with wings have been getting away with it for far too long - their time is up!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The latest untruth was about how Brussels red tape was holding back kipper smokers in the Isle of Man. But his assertion quickly became unstuck as it emerged that British rules added the extra bureaucracy. It was just the latest in a long series of half-true and outrageous stories from the buffoon who once steamrolled a -year-old boy during a rugby demonstration and got stuck halfway down a zipwire while promoting the London Olympics.    The tall tales began when he was a young Brussels correspondent. He wrote that the EU wanted to standardise coffins, the smell of manure and the size of condoms. “Everything I wrote from Brussels I found was sort of chucking these rocks over the garden wall,” he later admitted. “And I listened to this amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in England. “It really gave me this, I suppose, rather weird sense of power.” That sense of power has entranced Mr Johnson ever since, first as a journalist and then as a politician. Asked once why he wanted to move into politics, he told a friend: “They don’t put up statues to journalists.” The untruths and exaggerations did not stop, as the country learned when he led the Leave campaign.His claims that the UK was sending £million a year to Brussels and that Turkey was joining the EU helped to deliver Brexit .But his willingness to face both ways as long as it furthered his career sowed mistrust even on his own side. His decision to write two articles, one supporting Brexit and one opposing it, cast more doubt on his convictions. Many Tories suspect Mr Johnson is not a true Brexiteer at all and thatthe political wind changed so would he.    The mistrust of the new PM was further deepened when he demonstrated his willingness to flirt with right-wing populism. But he has laughed off criticism of his racist and offensive comments, including describing Muslim women wearing burkas as “letter boxes”, black people as “piccaninnies” and gay men as “bum boys”. He shrugged: “Occasionally some plaster comes off the ceiling.” Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson’s background is well known. His cosmopolitan upbringing in New York, England and Brussels as his father Stanley travelled the world with work. His fiercely competitive relationship with his siblings Jo, Rachel and Leo and his childhood ambition of becoming “world king”. But then came his artist mother Charlotte’s breakdown, his father’s infidelities and his parents’ bitter orce, which led to the young Boris being packed off to boarding school. It was while at Eton, seeking approval and comfort, that he transformed his personality into shambolic and fun Boris to hide his intellect. Now , the next PM is still described by his closest friends as needy. It explains much about how the next PM can be both deeply insecure and brashly arrogant at the same time. It also shows how he got through Oxford, scraping a : because he couldn’t be bothered to put in the work to get a first.    And also how his career survived being sacked twice, once from The Times and once from the Conservative front bench. His ambition was behind his decision to run as London mayor, which the Tories initially thought was a lost cause, but then won. Mr Johnson has repeatedly used his time at City Hall as a calling card, citing triumphs including the  Olympics or driving down crime. But his record was patchy in reality, with many successes conceived where and a mayoralty littered with vanity projects and gaffes. And while he dismissed his chances of getting to No as less likely than being “reincarnated as an olive”, it was always his aim.After eight years at City Hall, Mr Johnson ed to Parliament. Last year he was appointed Foreign Secretary by Theresa May , in a bid to keep him under control and out of the country.But his period at the Foreign Office was not a success.    Among his many errors were his role in getting British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe’s jail term extended. The most important figure in his transformation has been his girlfriend Carrie Symonds, , for whom he left long-suffering we Marina, the mother of four of his children. His marital indiscretions, which included multiple affairs and at least two children by other women, are well known. Mr Johnson is said to “yearn” for the stability his marriage provided, especially as his new relationship has been buffeted by rows, with the police even called to one. But allies also insist he is “smitten” with the former Tory PR chief. She has been credited not just with his weight loss and his smarter haircut but with helping to convince sceptical Tory MPs that Mr Johnson could not only get them a Brexit deal, but would also win a subsequent general election.

That raises the possibility that a long-feared threat - a No Deal Brexit - will become reality under our new Prime Minister. MPs may try to block a No Deal Brexit in Parliament, butthey donapost, it is still the legal default positionthereaposs no agreement by the Halloween deadline. No Deal been talked about for years. Theresa May secured a deal which MPs then voted down three times the EU delayed the date of Brexit twice and now Boris Johnson wants to reshape the deal entirely. But the whole time No Deal has been the backup plan - with Theresa May committing £billion or so, and Boris Johnson vowing to ramp up preparations further. So what does it actually mean in practical terms  If thereaposs no arrangement in time, weaposll lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and face the prospect of goods checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic. So the government published  technical notices over  and  outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats.    UK officials also unveiled aposday oneapos tarfs that would slap £, on the cost of a family car from the EU - but leave % of goods imports, including steel, tarf free. This could threaten struggling UK industries with a flood of cheap imports, but would also prevent searing price hikes that hit your wallet in the short term. Meanwhile ministers had , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Supermarkets and pharma giants were told to stockpile food and medicine. A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whoaposve written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le.  What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government canapost agree a Brexit aposWithdrawal Agreementapos by the Brexit deadline . The current -page deal, on the table since November , would have ensured businesses arenapost cut off by continuing rules in a apostransition periodapos until December . However, it came at a cost - a aposbackstopapos that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs and Boris Johnson opposed it. Mr Johnson has vowed to re-open talks on the deal, including dumping the backstop, despite the EU refusing to do so. If that fails, it leads us to a No Deal Brexit. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal aposblack holesapos where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . What is Boris Johnsonaposs plan for No Deal Brexit   Plan A is to renegotiate Theresa Mayaposs original, -page Brexit deal and come out with a deal on October . Plan B is to leave with no deal, but get a standstill arrangement from November  onwards to prevent crippling new tarfs. Plan C is to leave with no deal and no standstill arrangement. Experts say Plan B in particular is complete fantasy land. Boris Johnson claims he can use Article  of the General Agreement on Tarfs and Tradeto stop new tarfs springing up. This is called a managed no-deal - arranging lots of mini-deals to help smooth the path of leaving the EU. But GATT  says a plan and schedule must already be in place to form a customs union or free trade area, within a reasonableof time. That doesnapost include a No Deal Brexit . What does the governmentaposs financial watchdog say about No Deal Brexit  No Deal Brexit would trigger a year-long UK recession in just a few monthsapos time, the governmentaposs official spending watchdog predicted in July . The Office for Budget Responsibility said a recession would begin in the final three months of the UK leaves without agreement on October . The pound would drop in value instantly by % - while unemployment would rise by more than a quarter. GDP would fall % by the end of , around the same as the early s recession and a third of what was seen in the  financial crisis. In all No Deal would add about £billion a year to government borrowing from , the OBR said - or, put another way, £million a week. That in turn would hike the UKaposs net debt by % of GDP by March . Despite the drastic findings, OBR forecasters said their stress test was by no means a worst-case scenario.     ways No Deal Brexit could hit you DISCLAIMER: This information was gleaned mainly from government No Deal preparedness documents and advice over the last year. Some of these situations may be avoidedthere is a managed No Deal. . Martial law could be imposed with thousands of troops on standby  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention. . You need to renew your passport early  At the moment, British citizens can enter aposSchengen areaapos countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  October  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  yearsapos validity, youaposll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years donapost count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. . Pet owners must visit the vet FOUR MONTHS before a holiday  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youaposd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  . KFC and other big names could run out of food   Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply.  But thataposs not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet.  And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburyaposs, Asda and McDonaldaposs signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited.   As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.  They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeksapos inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  . You could lose your job  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues.

The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testthereaposs a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are a UK licence holder living in the EU or EEA you should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is no EU Exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there. . If youaposre an EU citizen, youaposll have fewer rights to stay in the UK  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether thereaposs a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyaposll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country. . Pharmacies and hospitals could start rationing medicine  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctorsapos prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the aposOperational Response Centreapos and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed heaposs become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar aposdisruptionapos  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnapost guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. The EU has agreed to keep permissions for services like the Channel Tunnel open for three monthsthere is No Deal, while a new agreement is negotiated. But there arenapost guarantees. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit.  Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now.  But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight.  “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note.  “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.”  . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statesthereaposs a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelandaposs Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventhereaposs a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thataposs based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youaposll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peopleaposs rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governmentaposs advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnapost result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  October . . If youaposre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  October . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between £ and £,. They will also need an import export license, which costs £. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wonapost be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in aposendangered speciesapos that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youaposd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use.

The starving child had reportedly been chained in the house by his tyrant father as a punishment. Desperate for food and water, the boy, named only as Tikhon, managed to escape when his Russian businessman father failed to correctly secure the shackles. Tikhon ran to a local shop in Velikovechnoye village, in Russiaaposs Krasnodar region, with the metal noose still clasped around his neck.  In CCTV footage from the shop, he still has the padlocked chain on while grabbing food from the shelves. Shocked checkout staff quizzed him about the shackles and he told them his father had imprisoned him in a shed. The unnamed man, , had rushed his pregnant second we to hospital to give birth when Tikhon, left home alone, managed to free himself by breaking a wooden bar to which the chain was fixed, say reports. He boy begged the shop staff not to tell his father he had fled - but instead they called police. Firefighters freed him from the chain.  The boy told officers he had been regularly chained by the neck in the cellar or shed or fixed to a radiator in the family’s home, often for long periods. Tikhon was taken for medical checks and later put into care in a social rehabilitation centre. The Kremlin’s children’s ombudswoman Anna Kuznetsova intervened to call on the Russian Investigative Committee to probe the allegations about the businessman who has ambitions to go in to politics. The child had been living with his father and stepmother, but now his real mother has demanded that the boy his removed from the businessman’s care. “I am extremely concerned about his fate,” said his mother, Viktoria. “I want him to be with me, and not with his tyrant dad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bride loses seven stone after","story":"NewsBride loses seven stone after husband couldnt get arms around her for first danceA comment from her daughters school friends was the motivation Christina Groves needed to lose weightShareCommentsByDawn CollinsonKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUL NewsBride Christina Groves was upset by her wedding photos \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman lost seven stone after being mortied during the first dance at her wedding, when her husband couldnapost stretch his arms around her. Christina Groves said her first dance was memorable for all the wrong reasons, but it was a comment from her daughter that gave her the motivation she needed to slim down. After the birth of her second daughter, her first born came home and said her classmates were asking why she was still fatsheaposd had the baby. That was a real wake up call for the -year-old. Christina had already been self-conscious wearing a size  wedding dress and weighing more than -and-a-half stone.    She said: “I just wanted the parts of the day where everyone was looking at me to be over as quickly as possible. “But I actually didn’t realise quite how bad it was until our photographer sent through pictures while we were on honeymoon and I saw the one of our first dance. I said to Jason, ‘oh my god, you couldn’t even get your arms around me’, it was so obvious, it was horrendous.” Christina had already reluctantly given up on her dream dress because she couldn’t fit into it, then photos of her wedding in October  left her cringing, but still she struggled to lose weight. “As much as I hated those pictures, that still wasn’t my biggest. I just couldn’t find the motivation to do anything.”    Nightly takeaways as Christina juggled finishing her degree with work and bringing up daughter Peyton, saw her weight creep up to over  stone. It was only after she gave birth to her second daughter Isabelle in July  that she decided something had to change.“I didn’t get the pregnancy I wanted, or the labour, I had high blood pressure all the way through and I was in constant pain with my back, legs, everything, all because of my weight,” she says.“Then my grandad came to visit me in hospital and took these photos and I looked like I was about to eat the baby, I was so huge! I thought, I have to do something.” Christina, from Crewe, joined her local Slimming World group at the end of August  weighing  stones lb.    Now, after switching takeaways for home-cooked curries and pasta, and ditching sugar-loaded snacks she has lost stones lb. “I feel like I did before I had my kids, when I didn’t have to think, I can’t shop there or I can’t wear that,” she added. For the mum-of-two, a battle with weight began when she was trying to breastfeed Peyton, who is now seven. “Peyton was born in December  and I remember on Christmas Day  I was really impressed with myself because I got back into my size  jeans. “But my milk wasn’t coming in and the midwe told me I wasn’t eating enough, so instead of eating the right stuff I just binged on takeaways, chocolate, sweets, crisps … anything I could get my hands on. “We’d go out in the car to settle [the baby] and we’d stop at the -hour McDonalds. It could be am but I’d still have a cheeseburger. “In my head I was doing it for the right reasons, and everybody kept telling me ‘don’t worry, you lose weight when you breastfeed’ but that didn’t happen for me. I must have been eating for about four. Even when she stopped breastfeeding, Christina carried on with her unhealthy eating habits and her weight kept going up. When she and Jason set their wedding date for October , she was keen to slim down.    “I’d been with my mum to look for dresses and there was one I really wanted but it was too small for me so I got my mum to try it on instead. The lady in the shop said ‘don’t buy it now, seeit motivates you’ so I tried fat absorbing tablets from my doctor, and a juice diet, but nothing worked. “I left ordering my dress until the last possible moment but eventually I had to accept I just wasn’t going to fit into it. I had to go into the plus-size section to choose another one, which was lovely but not the one I’d set my heart on.” Pregnant with Isabelle a year later, Christina wanted a home birth but was told at her first midwe appointment that wouldn’t be possible, she’d have to be on a high-risk ward, need regular scans and see an anesthetist in case of an emergency C-section. “Every scan I had they couldn’t get clear images because they were having to go through so much fat to get to her.    “Then a couple of weeks after the birth Peyton came home from school and said ‘mummy, all of my friends keep asking why you’re still fat now you’ve had the baby’. That was what it took to make me finally do something.” Now, instead of ordering a takeaway before they put the girls to bed, Christina comes home from her Slimming World group each Thursday, orders a food shop online and plans the family’s meals for the next week. “I always made sure Peyton ate healthily but I didn’t do it myself,” admits Christina. “Now I prepare all our food from scratch, while Isabelle is napping, so at teatime I just have to cook it.”  Christina says her husband has been supportive throughout her weight loss journey. “He’s always been so lovely, he never mentioned my weight even when I was at my biggest, and he’s really encouraged me since. He bought huge ‘’ balloons to celebrate my lb weight loss. “He loves our wedding photos because he says it was the day we all became a family and that makes them special, but I’d really like to renew our vows abroad for our th anniversary so we can have more taken, she said. This time we’ll do a first dance, I’ll get him to hold me so tightly and I’ll make sure the photographer gets that picture!” Before Breakfast - at least  crumpets smothered in butter and a large bowl of cereal Snacks of sweets and chocolates through the dayLunch - chips and gravy, or chips and beans from work canteen Dinner - takeaway AfterBreakfast - fruit and yoghurt Lunch - ham salad Dinner - pasta bake, curries, all made from scratch"},{"url":null,"title":"britains top 10 crap towns","story":"NewsBritains top  crap towns according to poll - does your area make the list The unscientic survey from ilivehere claims these are the UKs least inspiring towns and cities - and some locals arent holding backShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  FEB Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video britains-top--crap-towns-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brutal annual survey of the worst places in the country to live in has revealed a surprising new winner. Peterborough in Cambridgeshire came bottom of the aposCrap Townapos list with residents condemning it as backwards and miserable. The city boasts a th century cathedral, a Bronze Age village, a fossil display and a sizeable population of almost , inhabitants. Despite its impressive cultural and historical signicance, one person described it as the biggest dump in England with aggressive and inbred residents. Almost , people cast their vote for ilivehereaposs ranking Britainaposs least inspiring places to live. These are the places that make up the list...  Peterborough  The city has its fair share of detractors who say it is less than welcoming to visitors. The guide says: If booking a weekend get-away in Peterborough, it is customarya stranger holds eye contact with you for more than three seconds, to shout aposWhat apos and become extremely aggressive. Another described the people as without doubt some of the most aggressive, miserable, backwards, negative people I have ever come across. Thereaposs not a lot to love about this West Yorkshire market town, according to repsondents. One person said: Thereaposs nothing but pound shops and a few coffee shops. Itaposs polluted, unclean, full of idiots and a horrible place to live. Another local said: Itaposs a rough, boring, chavvy, c**p hole. For a demonstration of the chav scooterists trying to impress the scummy lady chavs, simply go and look in Morrisons car park from pm onwards - thousands of the cretins, unfortunately they never seem to fall off. In shortyou like your car windows, teeth, kneecaps etc. then avoid this s***e like you would a man with leprosy! You have been warned.    Rochdale  The Greater Manchester town was described in unflattering terms by those who got in touch. One person said: Take in the smells - the strong whf of tobacco and fatty foods with subtle hints of exhaust fumes, sweat and damp vegetables from the market area - and seeyou can detect a undertone of vomit, Karate aftershave and old cheese. And another said: Welcome to the cesspit of the universe, where evolution took a break and spat out this breed of useless slack-jawed yokels with less IQ than a glass of water.  Doncaster  A respondent wrote: Youaposve probably been forced to pass here on the train at some time in your le and seen all the attractions such as smack and rat-infested flats. Ah Doncaster, that s**t-hole surrounded by other s**t-holes like Hull, Barnsley, Pontefract, Scunthorpe and Rotherham. A night out in Donny is magical, with bums sitting on steps drinking White Lightning near the old strip club or the Jobcentre, and chavvettes with near nothing on, looking to volunteer to contribute to Doncasteraposs rising pregnancy rate.  Hull  Hull has made the top  every year since  and is three-times overall winner - so this is possibly an improvement. One critic said: I was born and bred in Hull and can honestly say itaposs a dump. Just spend ten minutes outside the Maternity Unit at Hull Royal Infirmary.  Rotherham  Rotherham is described as a worthy nomination by one disappointed critic: I think Iaposll head off somewhere  and get away from it all. I put as much distance between me and the population as possible after that first visit. I stopped going into the town centre - there was just no point because I like a pint without violence. After a year of reading headlines in the Rotherham Advertiser like aposChip Pan Fire Guts Houseapos, aposBody found outside Takeawayapos and aposAsbo Grandad at it againapos I decided I didnapost fit in and moved away.  Blackpool  Describing itself as the entertainment capital of the North, it was once famed for its golden mile but now according to locals, conjures up images of drunken stags and hens, falling over in the street and spewing on themselves, before retiring to a grotty seaside. One respondent said: Just walking around the town centre and seeing the result of years of inbreeding is an ordeal - we try to avoid the place unless absolutely necessary. The best thing about Blackpool is the M out. While in Blackpool all you smell is weed, McDonaldaposs, KFC - you may think itaposs a jolly seaside resort with candy floss and donkeys but itaposs a scum-bucket for the transients who come here to draw benefits in a holiday resort instead of in an inner city.  Castleford  One local reported: Highly scientic research - walking down the high street - revealed that one in three inhabitants under the age of  fits neatly into the chav box. In a town where everybody is a blood relative of the person next to them, you have to wonder whether the chavdom stems from bad breeding, or in the case of Castleford, possible interbreeding. A trip to Castleford is a real eye opener- and you need to keep your eyes open becauseyou dare to close them, theyaposd have your wallet faster than you could say aposXRi.apos If someone wanted to give Yorkshire an enema, this is where theyaposd stick the tube.  Oldham  The guide claims: This Greater Manchester town conjures up images of shaven-headed gentlemen discussing the political issues of the day in a flat roof pub like the one in the TV show aposShamelessapos and the reality is only slightly dferent. The people of Oldham look as though the government has been performing nuclear testing in the area. If you want culture and sophistication, then look no further than Yorkshire Street and the local shopping centres, where Sports Direct is the new Hugo Boss and TJ Hughes is the new Harrods.  Blackburn  The Lancashire town hold the dubious honour of being crown the least offensive borough on list. One said: The estates make Syria look calm. You can guarantee thatyou dare to walk down these down-trodden dogs**t ridden estates - and mind the needles- you will spot the inhabitants walking freely in dressing gowns, fluffy slippers and in the case of women, undoubtedly pregnant, with a fag in their gob going to pick up another free prescription from the clap clinic. And: Drug dealers, dole wasters, bums, guttersnipes, fallen women, young slappers and their steroid-pumped teenage boyfriends. Itaposs a nightmare - a cross between aposShamelessapos and the aposStar Warsapos canteen.

One in seven adults still light up and rates for pregnant women have stopped falling for the first time. A Government Green Paper on preventing ill-health says the NHS will offer aid on quitting to any smokers admitted to hospital. But it comes as Tory cuts mean only half of local authorities offer all smokers the support they need. Between   and  , spending on tobacco control and smoking cessation services fell by £.million – or %. And the Green Paper has no plan for a levy on tobacco firms to pay for services, which campaigners had called for.    Sarah Woolnough, policy director at Cancer Research UK, said: “Smoking is still the biggest preventable cause of cancer, illness and avoidable death. “The pledge to become a smoke-free country by  will require continuous and comprehensive action, including making sure every smoker has the support they need to quit. “It’s only fair that hugely profitable tobacco companies should be made to pay for these measures, to help clean up the mess they have made.” Smoking costs the economy an estimated £billion a year. The consultation on the Green Paper runs until October . It comes as Tory cuts to public health budgets mean that only half of local authorities now offer all smokers the support they need to quit.    There was no plan for a levy on tobacco firms to pay for stop smoking services, which campaigners had called for. The Green Paper said: “Thanks to our concerted efforts on smoking, we now have one of the lowest smoking rates in Europe with fewer than one in six adults smoking. “Yet, for the % of adults who still smoke, it’s the main risk to health.” Previously the government had aimed to create the first smoke-free younger generation, with rates close to zero, by . The target aimed to reduce the number of  year olds who regularly smoke from % to % or less by then. Smoking rates for adults are still falling but they have flatlined for some groups. In Blackpool one in four pregnant women smoke, while in Westminster it is one in . Smoking is estimated to cost the economy as a whole £ billion a year. This includes £. billion in costs to the NHS, £. billion to employers with the remaining cost to local authorities and wider society. The smoking ban in public places was introduced in England in  followed by plain packaging in . Recently a goal was announced to reduce smoking rates to % by . The Green Paper said: “The gains in tobacco control have been hard-won, and there’s still much to do. For the % of adults who are not yet smoke-free, smoking is the leading cause of ill-health and early death, and a major cause of inequalities. That’s why the government wants to finish the job.”    The main stop smoking support services have traditionally been provided by councils which have seen swinging cuts to their budgets. This has meant local authorities have been forced to scale back stop smoking support. These include consultations with a trained adviser on quitting including a plan working towards a quit date. Stop smoking aids can also be provided such as vaping devices and nicotine patches. Between   and   local authority spending on tobacco control and stop smoking services in England fell by £.million or %. Spending per resident smoker fell from £. to £.. People wanting to quit can also go to their GP but access to nicotine replacements on NHS prescription has been increasingly rationed.

Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and particularly John Major made mistakes in Downing Street but they were titans next to the political pygmy poised to be unveiled today as the Tory Party’s next resident of Downing Street. Neither in the  referendum nor at the  General Election did Britain vote for the catastrophic clf-edge no-deal Brexit which buffoon Johnson is now peddling. He certainly didn’t tell us this was what was going to happen back when he was lying on the side of a bus about millions for the NHS. The danger to jobs, livelihoods, trade and relationships of no-deal is serious and real. Yet it is now entirely possible the country will endure economic storms from a disorderly exit simply because Johnson would say anything to win over Tory party members – an electorate smaller than the population of Gateshead, Oldham, Derby or Swansea. Blair, Brown and Major standing up to be counted shames our other living former PM, David Cameron, who prefers holidaying to calling out his Bullingdon Club chum. As a Prime Minister, Cameron was catastrophically bad. Problem is, we’re about to be landed with one who might just be even worse. Strait mates As it all kicks off with Iran in the Strait of Hormuz, we turn to our closest neighbours and allies: Europe. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s appeal for a Euro-flotilla shows where our best interests rest. Britain is stronger with the European Union, whatever the Brexit elite pretends.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

appropriate that we are celebrating this occasion here in its shadow.ldquoThe Freedom of East Lothian is the highest honour our council can award.ldquoIt recognises those who play an important role here: those who represent our county and its values, contribute to the fabric of our civic society or who are integral to the history and tradition of East Lothian.ldquoIn granting the Freedom to the Lothians and Border Yeomanry today, the Regiment joins the Royal Scots Borderers st Battalion, renowned artist John Bellany and golf champion Catriona Matthew as worthy recipients of this rarely-bestowed tribute.ldquoLast weekend, our nation came together to commemorate Armed Services Day, which marks the important part that the Armed Services have played, and continue to play, in our

honoured to be given the Freedom of East Lothian.He added: ldquoThe day marks the reinvigoration of the strong partnership between the community and the squadron from which many of those serving, have served or represented through our long history and antecedent regiments live and work ndash we are grateful for the enduring support.ldquoIt is signicant and fitting that we are able to parade through Dunbar and also rededicate the war memorial in what is our spiritual home.ldquo[It was] a truly proud and memorable day and one which reconnects the lsquoCountyrsquos Regimentrsquo with the community

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10052408.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

But populism has nothing to do with the social origins of its leaders. Nigel Farage used to be an investment banker. Donald Trump is a billionaire. It is about the people they seek to represent ndash often dismissively labelled the ldquoleft behinds, often non-graduates in low-paying jobs in non-metropolitan areas. The force that gave us Brexit.By its very nature, populism is not a coherent political philosophy. It is more visceral ndash the inarticulate fury of people who feel they the plaything of remote forces beyond their control. Its origins lay in the disruption that followed the  financial crisis, in which bankers were bailed out but not the people. They suffered insecurity, economic uncertainty and the longest pay freeze since the Napoleonic Wars.Populists linked arms with the more traditional, reactionary nationalist politicians against the globalist, liberal-democratic ldquoestablishment, that has dominated the media and politics for the last three decades. Think of Brown, Clegg and Cameron standing in line in the  election: three identikit, pro-European, neoliberal suits. Think of the leaders of the European Union. That is the establishment against which populists believe they are revolting.:Boris Johnson is asked what furniture he would need inside Number In France, the Gilet Jaunes protest continues, after nine months of street demonstrations, violent confrontations and petition-signing. It is inchoate, unpredictable and largely leaderless. But as anyone visiting France this summer will testy ndash it is everywhere. And it is overwhelmingly white. The repressive measures used against them by President Macron would be a national scandal were they used here.As Donald Trump demonstrated last week, populism has a strong racialist strand, though it is not simply a fascist movement as many on the left claim. Donald Trump is not an ideological white supremacist . He is above all an opportunist, ready to use whatever comes to hand to promote his personal popularity. With him, ratings mean more than political conviction.But that doesnt mean he can plead innocence after his genuinely shocking attacks on the democratic ldquowomen of colour last week . This began as crude electoral politics. He was trolling the Democrat Party, and the media, by singling out the radical ldquosquad of Democrat congresswomen, as theyre known. He wants the Democrats to be indelibly associated in the public mind with its multicultural Left, the better to win over white middle Americans and moderate Latinos. But he unleashed something deeply worrying.As the chants of ldquosend them home erupted at his rally Trumps trademark smirk seemed at first to nodding along. But even he now seems uneasy about the genie he has uncorked. Not since the s has racism been a factor in US presidential politics ndash at least not overtly. Barak Obama avoided playing the race card. Trump has now placed it firmly on the table, and it isnt going to go away.Donald Trumps flirtation with racism could actually lose him the next election, because many middle Americans are appalled at his behaviour. The United States prides itself, after all, on being the most multi-cultural, multi-racial society in the world ndash one which used to welcome ldquothe huddled masses of immigrants with open arms.Iain Macwhirter: Why Irsquom secretly looking forward to seeing Boris Johnson in Number TenBut liberals shouldnt get their hopes up. There is no rule that says racism cant help win elections. These are troubled times, and politicians need to exercise responsibility so as not to conjure forces they cannot control.Boris Johnson is also often called a racist, and a homophobe. This is largely because of his describing burqa-wearing Muslims as ldquobank-robbers and ldquoletter boxes. The future PM is not himself racist, as anyone who knows him can testy, but that doesnt mean he is immune to its compelling force.As London Mayor, Boris Johnson made great efforts to win the support of Muslims in that multi-racial city. He included many non-whites in his cabinet. When he takes over this week we can expect him to make great play of his progressive liberal credentials. He will remind voters that the infamousarticle argued against banning the burqa.However, there is no doubt that his signature politics of Brexit, while not racist in itself, arises at least in part from resentment at immigration. Many of Johnsons supporters are the kind of people you might find at Donald Trump rallies. His first test as Prime Minister should be to create clear multicultural water between himself and the American President ndash his equivocation last week about labelling Trumps remarks ldquoracist does not augur well.Johnson desperately needs the White House to deliver some kind of free trade deal that will show Europe that Brexit Britain means business. His first foreign visit as Prime Minister will be to the Trump Residence to plead his case for special treatment on trade. If Mr Johnson has any integrity, he will also make clear his concern at Trumps racist rhetoric ndash but I wouldnt hold my breath.Its an open secret that Johnson is looking to an early election to capitalise on Labours internal problems, which are to do with allegations of another kind of racialism: anti-Semitism. However, Westminster is now a four party political system with Nigel Farages Brexit Party and the revived Liberal Democrats challenging hard. Boris Johnson may have to seek the support of the Faragiste MPs to form a government. That could sht British politics further to the populist right.Nigel Farages party is not an overtly racist party either, though his former vehicle, Ukip, has recently been showing clear signs of becoming one. But there is no doubt that Brexit Party supporters are hostile to immigration. Racism exists as a latent force in all parties, but in nationalist ones in particular. Our own Scottish National Party used to have in its ranks ldquoanglophobes like the poet Hugh MacDiarmid, and ldquoblood and soil factions like ldquoSeed of the Gael.David Pratt: Tracing Trumps bigotryHowever, the SNP also stands as a beacon of hope in this darkening night of populism. For the party expunged all trace of anti-English racism from its ranks in the s and s. It is now arguably the most progressive, anti-racialist political party in the UK. Of course, there are still some SNP supporters around who hate English people, but they are not tolerated.There is a huge temptation for SNP politicians to subtly exploit latent anglophobia when arguing against ldquoWestminster rule. But the SNP has shown that it is possible to conduct nationalist politics with great success by avoiding these ldquotropes as theyre called. Indeed, the SNPs electoral success has largely been built on the claim that Scotland could be more progressive and more multicultural than the UK. It has raised ersity and antiracism to the level of a national political programme. In these dficult times, we should be thankful for that at least."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-give-mps-free-vote-solve-brexit-mess","story":"It seems abundantly clear that the view of Brexit placed before the electorate at the time of the referendum could be said to have been seriously unrealistic. The House of Commons is now very well placed to say whether or not the concept of Brexit placed before the voters at the time of the referendum is still defensible, and henceone can reasonably refer to the will of the people as expressed at that time as still being relevant. Accordingly I believe that a free vote ndash a vote of conscience ndash by the House of Commons, should be held, with two clear options: either to abandon the process of leaving the European Union, or to continue on a path to departure. This move would place Members of Parliament in their proper position as inidual elected representatives in a representative democracy of deciding on behalf of all their constituents which path to follow. Before the vote MPs should, I consider, be reminded that as they represent all their constituents , they must put aside party and personal predilections, and vote on what they believe, in conscience, is in the best interests of all of their constituents, of all of the people of the United Kingdom and of the concept of a peaceful Europe. An analogy would be the vote on the abolition of capital punishment.As there has been ample opportunity for debate prior to this pivotal point, I suggest that the making of speeches before a vote might be ruled out, other than a statement setting out procedure.Professor John R Hume, Glasgow G.THIS may be too obvious to say, but somebody has to: opposition to the Tories is tragically split. The more people change to the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, the more secure the Tories become.In one General Election, the SNP took all the seats in Scotland except one. Did that get the Tories out Whatever you say about Labour right now, the party is all wersquove got. If it won all its seats, the Tories would be out.We have to accept that some people have curious enthusiasms. I cannot believe that any adult would care where a ball lands, but there it is. I cannot believe anybody would be excited about his inadvertent birthplace, but there it is, and it includes my best friends.Now Labour says it is turning Remain. Its leaders must have been reading my letters.My favourite dream is one huge united anti-Tory party, who would concentrate on socialism and European membership, setting aside meantime, anti-Semitism and kne crime. Oh, and Scottish independence.Mrs Moyna Gardner, Glasgow G.Itrsquos a pity these measures werenrsquot taken right across the th century, when Scotlandrsquos economy was directly controlled from London, and suffered much lower growth rates than the UK. As one banker put it some years ago: ldquoScotland was in recession for  years.GR Weir, Ochiltree.MANY people are critical of our politicians, with good reason, but the underlying causes of their poor performance are not clear.One possibility is that the political approach to decision-making is derived from the legal system. Unfortunately, the practice of deciding outcomes by persuasive argument is not always fit for purpose outside the courtroom. Global warming will dominate le on earth for the foreseeable future and no amount of discussion or debate will change this, yet the Chancellor of the Exchequer insists on pointing out that the costs are very high, with the implication that we should continue burning coal, oil and gas. Of course the costs are high, but the alternatives even in the medium term are much worse.Brexit is a classic example of a decision that should be made following a determined and honest attempt to establish the facts and to make those facts public. Instead we have groups of people who think that they can win an argument, based purely on rhetoric. Evenmany of the outcomes are uncertain, there should be a process of evaluation that is not based on \"winning\" or \"losing\".A second possible reason for Westminster politicians to be so incompetent is that many are very poorly educated. To go from an expensive private school to Oxford, where  weeks a year for three years may be spent studying a subject of little or no practical relevance to le on this planet, is not a useful preparation for decision-making in a technically complex world. This is exacerbated by going straight into politics, buoyed by a high level of self-confidence and not the smallest notion of what le is like for those who have to earn a living. Perhaps the worst aspect of this career path is that the ones who end up leading the pack are those with the most confidence, not the clearest thinkers.A third possible reason is that Oxford graduates tend to go back to their professors for advice. If the professors are purely theoretical in their analyses they will be unable to reflect the realities of le and all the real world uncertainties that affect the outcomes of policy decisions.A fourth potential reason is that le in politics is very stressful. This seems to lead to a kind of febrile state, in which the politician loses all contact with reality le becomes a merry-go-round, based on lies and pretence, with the object to become famous rather than to serve.These observations are not specic to one party or another. Whichever way you look at it, the Westminster system needs to be reformed.Roger Waigh, Helensburgh.FOR months you have given over a complete page to letters on Brexit even though Holyrood estimates the financial impact on Scotland will be around pound billion a year. However, there is scant discussion provided over the annual pound billion cost of a ban on gas as part of a zero carbon policy.What is of even more importance to Scottish consumers is who will pay these costsndash that is, is it the domestic consumer or will politicians insist that renewable energy is price-matched to the p unit cost of gas  Ian Moir, Castle Douglas."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Who does Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe  think he is ","story":"BBC, Monday, pm ****IN Harry Hillrsquos Alien Fun Capsule at the weekend, the big collared one described the genealogy show Who Do You Think You Are as the programme in which ldquowell known people cry over people theyrsquove never even heard of who died hundreds of years ago.If that was so, the first in the new series conformed to type.

At stake is more than poundm over the next eight years - and the partyrsquos perceived commitment to public ownership.Trade union RMT - already in dispute with Serco over its management of the Caledonian Sleeper train - has launched a bitter attack on what it called SNPrsquos ldquounhealthy relationship with the company, a claim which has angered government insiders.The union, one of few to support a Yes vote in the  referendum, has long been demanding that the in ferry argot - be fully nationalised.But its most recent attack came after a Serco subsidiary involved in electronic tagging of offenders was fined pound.m in fines and costs after a six-year investigation in to fraud and  accounting by the Serious Fraud Office. Serco has admitted to problems at the subsidiary and the SFO has welcomed steps it has taken to prevent their repetition.However, RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: ldquoOnce again, Serco, the specialists in failure, have been found out. Fraud and  accounting are serious offences that should make any Government think twice about using private companies to deliver essential public services.:Critics call for ferry overhaul following latest CalMac breakdownldquoYet Serco continue their incompetent handling of new rolling stock on the Caledonian Sleeper contract at RMT members and passengers expense without the prospect of any censure from the Scottish Government.ldquoAnd on leline ferries, Serco have never been required to state the profits they take out of Northern Isles Ferry Services contract they were awarded by the Scottish Government in .ldquoDespite this, Serco could be awarded the next NIFS contract in August, when MSPs are on holiday.ldquoWorkers, passengers and communities, especially in Orkney and Shetland, deserve the stability and certainty of a publicly operated and run ferry service, not another gamble on Serco Grouprsquos predatory empire.Serco earlier this month accepted the fine. Its chief executive, Nicholas Soames, said: ldquoThose of us who now run the business are mortied, embarrassed and angry that, in a period between six and nine years ago, Serco understated the level of profitability of its Electronic Monitoring contract in its reports to the Ministry of Justice.

There are only two potential candidates, Serco and CalMac, which operates Clyde and Hebridean ferries. A private ferry operator, however, is challenging the whole process on ldquostate aid grounds.The Scottish Government said RMT rhetoric on the Sercorsquos tagging controversy had nothing to do with ferries to Orkney and Shetland.A spokesman said: ldquoThese fines are completely unrelated to Sercorsquos contracts with the Scottish Government and attempts to connect them are misleading at best. Any bids submitted to the Scottish Government must follow robust procurement rules and be compliant with the financial requirements specied in the Invitation to Tender.Serco tried and failed to take CalMacrsquos west coast contract recently but robustly defended its performance on the northern routes.Stuart Garrett, Sercorsquos Managing Director at NorthLink Ferries, said ldquoOur track record of customer satisfaction, reliability, safety, community support and continuous improvement speaks for itself.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy. So far Prospect has continued to ask for a pay increase far in excess of what we are able to afford and that unfortunately remains the situation.“We remain committed to resolving the dispute. Our latest offer of a retention allowance of £, over a five year period remains on the table and will continue to explore potential solutions within our affordability.”“The continued industrial action is having a signicant impact on our passengers, communities and the airlines operating from our airports.

It also provided me with a competitive activity at which I could shine a bit in a school environment which leant heavily towards rugby as way of le and ... religion. So I debated for my senior school years, then debated at university, eventually ending up as President of Debates at the University of Edinburgh. At school and university, I did well enough until we had to compete against the Glasgow schools – particularly the Catholic schools or, later, against Glasgow University. Then we were always massacred, slaughtered, gubbed – call it what you like. We lost.Then I became a teacher and, once again to avoid having to run about anywhere wet and muddy, I was ‘the debating coach’. For the first two or three years, the same thing happened – my boysdid well enough until they were mercilessly crushed by the dark forces of the West. Then in , Scottish teachers went on strike and only private schools, by and large, entered debating competitions – the biggest competition in Scotland saw the number of schools taking part fall from  to  in one year. : How to bridge Scotland’s attainment gap - Dr Geetha Marcus: ‘Traditional ethos’ in Scots schools hitting attainment gap fightMy boys won that year, but they knew, of course, that the giants were sleeping. And despite the great efforts of many iniduals teachers in state schools in Scotland, over the past  years success in debating has remained, very often, in the lap of independent schools, which only educate about five per cent of the Scottish pupil population.This is a great pity for all sorts of reasons and it’s now time to do something about it, which will complement the work being done already in a small but increasing number of state schools. Now is a good time, because of the Scottish Government’s laudable intention of closing the poverty-related attainment gap. Now, it’s a fact that lots of really able kids who come from more deprived backgrounds don’t do as well at school as their middle-class counterparts. There are , reasons for this, andyou would like to sit down with me, I could explain some of them over the course of a week or two. But one crucial reason, which can be summed up in one word, is confidence. And this is where the funny, wee, niche, extra-curricular activity of debating comes in – get a girl or boy to feel comfortable debating, and they will be comfortable in interviews for jobs or for uni they will feel comfortable about arguing politics they will be happier about answering in class and they will become, in this respect, like the articulate, confident middle-class students at more privileged schools. I feel a gap closing.That is why the two charities in Scotland which promote debating – the English-Speaking Union, which has run debating and public-speaking competitions for decades, and which also encourages oracy in other areas, and Scottish Schools Debating, a smaller charity which I helped to found  years ago, with the intention of ensuring that there was always a Scottish team in the World School Debating Championships, have come together in a project called ‘Speak Up Scotland!’. The object of this exciting programme is to take debating into schools which have no history – or at least no recent history – of debating, focussing particularly on schools in more deprived areas, through a series of workshops and competitions culminating, we hope, in a two or three-day ‘debate camp’ next summer which would be free for those kids who had participated in the earlier stages. The project, which is being run by the English-Speaking Union’s programmes officer, Jordan Pfotenhauer, a young South African law graduate, who has had success running debating programmes aimed at reducing inequality in his home country is off to a great start, with over  S and S pupils having already taken part in workshops in their schools, including the Wester Hailes Education Centre in Edinburgh, Baldragon Academy in Dundee and Annan Academy. Jordan says of the work so far: “Teaching S and S pupils around Scotland how to debate over the past few months has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It’s amazing to see these young people grow in confidence over the course of just one workshop, learning crucial communication and argumentation skills in the process. We’ve covered topics ranging from school lunches to nuclear non-proleration and are certainly in for a busy coming school year at this rate!” So it’s maybe time to refresh our outdated thinking about debating – a lot of people think of it as being a fairly nerdy activity and, in truth they have a point. But Donald Dewar, Malcolm Rkind, Alex Salmond, Ruth Davidson, Michael Gove, John Smith, David Steel ... etc etc ... were debaters at school and or university. And another cultural reference – in ‘Modern Family’ the nerdy debater Alex says to her beautul and very popular sister – “remember, Haley, that one day my friends will be your friends’ bosses”. All those of us involved in ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ are hoping that this will be a leline for some of Scotland’s least well-off young people to feel more confident and – who knows  – with that confidence aspire to be First Minister, or a university student, or simply someone who feels a bit better about themselves. If you would like to know more about ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ oryou work at or know of a school that might like to participate, then please contact Jordan or Gayle at the English-Speaking Union . The programme is delivered to schools entirely free and soyou, or your company or organisation, would like to help financially, then please access the ‘Speak Up Scotland!’ justgiving page – every donation really helps us give young Scots who need it more confidence.Cameron Wyllie, a retired headteacher, publishes a blog called A House in Joppa©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

They will ask the Shetland Islands Council to declare a climate emergency, as Orkney Islands Council did earlier this year. raquoWhat an amazing turnout, thanks to everyone who participated. 👏🏻🙌🏻As long as people in power put the value of money ahead of anything then we will never cease to destroying the planet until mother nature herself decides for us. For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the .

This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per fortnight out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rte to broadcast glenanne film","story":"RTÉ is to broadcast a documentary by a West Belfast film-maker about the notorious loyalist Glenanne Gang, believed to be responsible for over  sectarian killings of Catholics during the Troubles, mainly in counties Armagh and Tyrone.Unquiet Graves will air next week, July  at .pm.The Glenanne Gang, which also contained members of the legal British Army UDR among its number, was also responsible for the Dublin-Monaghan bombings which killed  civilians in May , as well as the Miama Showband massacre in .Seán Murray’s film– which is narrated by the Oscar-nominated actor Stephen Rea – has previously been shown at An Chultúrlann and at the Movie House cinema in Belfast.Murray tweeted: “I can now announce that Unquiet Graves will be screening on RTÉ  on Monday the th of July at .pm. “This is of immense importance to the #Glenanne families# and is a major milestone on the road to justice.

According to Ms Satichis legal team the grounds given for the refusal were that her circumstances in Zimbabwe were not sufficiently favourable to cause her to .They issued judicial review proceedings, arguing that the decision was unlawful and unreasonable.However, counsel for the Home Office later told the court an agreement has been reached in the case.With the challenge resolved, Ms Symington said she was delighted the Home Office has retaken its decision and granted a permit to the housekeeper. \"She awaits receipt of the visa to be able to travel in time for the wedding,\" the solicitor said.\"Our client is thrilled to arrive in Belfast within the coming week to celebrate this happy occasion with her friends.\"Ms Symington went on to claim UK Border officials often provide \"arbitrary and demeaning\" grounds for rejecting applications made by those seeking to be reunited with family or to see friends.Pointing to the alleged reasons for initially refusing a visa to Ms Satichi, she said: \"The implication, which is not terribly subtle, is that le in Africa, whatever your circumstances, is one to be fled.\"She added: \"The obvious question remains as to how many other foreign nationals are applying for such visas and are being refused on similar spurious grounds.\"We suggest that the Home Office need to re-examine their decision making process and make changes to avoid court proceedings being brought which ultimately form a substantial pull on the public purse.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"parttime teacher who missed out on temporary promotion at assumption settles for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry.

Sarah is afraid to let her child out to play in the park as a result.“Since I’ve been there I’ve noticed non-stop partying, people taking drugs, someone was stabbed in the head, a person died over-dosing, a couple fighting outside, a paedophile overlooking the park had to be removed too.“People off their heads on drugs crashed into my car recently too when my wain was with me.

All seven charges from the first appearance on th April  remain.There is a collective view amongst residents in Balliniska Avenue and Heights that these anti-social iniduals must be removed but they feel Clanmil Housing isn’t taking decisive action.Sectarian abuse has also been witnessed in the area with people being called “Fenians” by a certain family.“Clanmil says it’s taking action but there are people who’ve been a problem for a while and they’re still living here. I don’t think they’re doing enough,\" Sarah said, \"realistically there should be strikes, but people with knives etc should be removed straight away.“How can you feel safe as a single mother with all this going on.”She added: “When I was looking for a house I had to be interviewed, so I don’t know how these people got in with criminal records.“Even today I seen the police here arresting people, it’s just constant now.“But they’re not going to force me out because I like living here.”Police responseResponding to the latest incident and addressing residents’, a PSNI spokesperson said that on Thursday, th July, police received a report of an altercation and anti-social behaviour in the Baliniska Heights area of Derry.On arrival of police there was no sign of this altercation.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.

Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
