[{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan NOT bring Lilibet Christened Church England","story":"Share this articleIn August, royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliam told the Express the couple will \u0027do things their own way\u0027 with their daughter Lilibet. He said: \u0027It seems certain that her christening will be in Meghan\u0027s home state and with the secrecy but without the controversy that surrounded Archie\u0027s christening.\u0027 The couple have never released an image of their daughter to the public, with royal commentator Richard saying the decision shows the Duke and Duchess are acting on their own terms.The latest claims come after it was revealed that Prince Harry was not expected to return to Britain next week to join his brother Prince William at a party to honour their mother. The party had originally been planned for July 1, when the brothers unveiled a statue of Diana, Princess of Wales, on what would have been her 60th birthday.Prince Harry flew back for the unveiling without wife Meghan, who had given birth to the couple\u0027s second child, Lilibet.Due to coronavirus restrictions, the plans were scaled back, with just the Princes, their uncle Earl Spencer and aunts Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes present.Harry was due to attend the rescheduled party for 100 guests, believed to include Sir Elton John, on October 19, although it is unclear if Meghan would have accompanied him.However sources this week said it was not expected he would return for this. Since attending the statue\u0027s unveiling, Harry has announced he is writing his memoirs. They are due for release next year, when the Queen will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee to mark 70 years on the throne. In February a spokesperson for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry confirmed the couple were expecting a second child together. The couple shared their announcement - aptly on Valentine\u0027s Day - by posting a black and white image of Harry resting his hand on Meghan\u0027s head as she lay in his lap underneath a tree.\u0027The photograph of the Duke and Duchess was was taken by the couple\u0027s longtime friend Misan Harriman. What wonderful news for the Sussexes!!\u0027 their spokesperson added. Lilibet – whose middle name is Diana – was born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in June.    It is understood the Queen was informed by Prince Harry that her great grandchild would be named in her honour, ahead of their official announcement which was made on their official website. However, Buckingham Palace appeared to be caught off guard by the timing of the Sussexes\u0027 news with a spokesman for the palace congratulating the couple 90 minutes after the announcement broke.    Omid Scobie, a journalist favoured by Harry and Meghan, later tweeted that the couple would \u0027not be sharing a photograph at this time\u0027 of Lilibet and that they were now on \u0027parental leave\u0027. He said the couple\u0027s office was encouraging anyone who wanted to send gifts to support organisations working for women and girls. The name Lilibet was coined by the Queen and used by her younger sister Margaret and their parents.George VI once said: \u0027Lilibet is my pride. Margaret is my joy.\u0027Lilibet arrived six days before what would have been the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 100th birthday."},{"url":null,"title":"Now Harry Meghan banking","story":"Share this article Meghan last visited the city in September 2019 when she made the surprise stop at the US Open. This came seven months after her last trip, when pals including Amal Clooney and Gayle King held a lavish baby shower for her at The Mark Hotel\u0027s $75,000-a-night penthouse suite on Manhattan\u0027s Upper East Side.The Duchess traveled to that event from London on a private jet, with the bash estimated to have cost $500,000.   During their first stop on their Big Apple trip, Meghan and Harry posed for photos in front of the One World Trade Center observatory\u0027s floor-to-ceiling windows, which offer stunning views of New York City and New Jersey. The Sussexes were joined by Governor Hochul, 63, Mayor de Blasio, 60, de Blasio\u0027s wife Chirlane McCray, 66, and the couple\u0027s son Dante, 24.  Harry and Meghan then visited the 911 memorial pools around 9am EST.  The couple inspected the large black pools, built in the footprints of the original Twin Towers, before entering the 911 Museum, which sits underneath, and spending around half an hour inside.     Harry and Meghan, who donned somber dark outfits, walked hand-in-hand around the memorial pools and museum accompanied by National September 11 Memorial \u0026amp Museum President Alice Greenwald and Patricia Harris from Bloomberg Philanthropy. The couple\u0027s two-year-old son Archie and three month-old daughter Lilibet remain at home in California.  Harry and Meghan arrived at One World Trade Center in sombre outfits, likely chosen for their planned trip to the nearby 911 Memorial afterwards. The couple exited a black SUV, and were whisked up to the skyscraper\u0027s viewing deck - which sits between floors 100 and 102 - to meet Hochul and de Blasio, who arrived moments before the royals.Meghan donned a stylish dark blue outfit, with a matching jacket, polo neck, wide-legged trousers, heels and her hair swept back into a business-like bun.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose. Anyone over the age of 12 can\u0026nbsp now register for a vaccine.

And of course it doesn’t help that some places turn a blind eye.’ Photograph: Joe Dunne Earlier this summer, before even outdoor dining was permitted, business was brisk at one of Letterkenny’s most popular coffee spots as people queued for a takeaway caffeine hit. One customer who had parked his Northern Ireland registered car outside the door was attracting a lot of attention as the only person on the premises not wearing a mask. Reminded politely about the regulations, he mumbled something about a medical condition and was invited to wait in his car until his order was delivered to him there.“He turned on his heel in a rage, hopped into his car and drove off,” according to a local.One bugbear of businesses operating close to the Border is that the Republic has always been “a few steps behind” when it comes to easing Covid restrictions, making it attractive for local customers to head North, while causing resentment among some customers travelling in the opposite direction.Last week’s announcement from Stormont that the North’s hospitality sector will have to wait until the end of this month before most restrictions are lifted, slightly behind the October 22nd date set by the Government in Dublin, has caused little jubilation.“We’re stealing a wee march on them for once, but a week is going to make no difference,” says Letterkenny businessman Enda Nicholls. “People always move ahead of the curve. In Derry now, many people are not wearing masks and there are pubs in Letterkenny who are already staying open until 12.30 and 1am.”That lack of solidarity made it even more painful when Nicholls was subjected to a barrage of online abuse after announcing on Facebook at the end of July that his Arena 7 entertainment complex, comprising a bowling alley, restaurant, bar and children’s play area, would be reopening in line with Government regulations and for “fully vaccinated people only” .The vitriol, much of it apparently from the southern side of the Border, included calls for a boycott, comparisons with Hitler and Stalin, and allegations of “medical apartheid” and segregation.In a town where many were horrified after a Covid-19 patient was “rescued” from the local hospital by anti-vaccine campaigners, only to die there after being readmitted, people sprang to Nicholls’ defence.“It was an orchestrated campaign,” he says of the abuse, adding that “around 90 per cent have voted with their feet by having the vaccine”.Many of his customers from the North check in advance to see what the regulations are but he has had to turn away a small number who arrived at Arena 7 without proof of vaccination.“When we explain the law, that puts some people off. And of course it doesn’t help that some places turn a blind eye,” he says, referring to a small number of pubs in Co Donegal who reportedly haven’t stuck rigidly to the rules.“Unfortunately the Government tells us to police it,” said Nicholls who believes that being allowed to reopen with strict rules was “the lesser of two evils”.Like many in the hospitality sector, he says, having consistently been “a few weeks behind” Northern Ireland when it comes to easing restrictions has been an ongoing challenge.PJ McDermott, the co-owner of An Grianan hotel in Burt, a stone’s throw from the Border, estimates that he lost 50 per cent of his business from Northern Ireland throughout the pandemic.“We are always two steps behind the North. We have to ask people questions. It is not straightforward. There is a little bit of resistance,” he says.While he is optimistic about a bounce once restrictions ease on October 22nd, he believes Donegal should have been aligned to Northern Ireland when it comes to Covid-19 restrictions. When An Grianan was barely operating, a premises a few minutes’ drive away on the other side of the Border was “flat to the mat” with several Donegal cars regularly seen outside the door, he says.There is also a concern in the hospitality sector that young people, long impatient with early closing time and curtailed social lives, have now discovered how easy it is to get to places like Derry and will continue to see that as an option even when all restrictions are lifted.Paddy Simpson, owner of the Brunswick Moviebowl in Derry, says the proportion of his customers from the South rose from 15 per cent pre-Covid to 25 per cent during the pandemic.“We have always been a few weeks ahead of the South,” says Simpson, who stresses that there were ups and downs throughout the last 18 months. “There were periods when people from the South seemed to think you would catch Covid if you came to Northern Ireland.”The more relaxed attitude to mask wearing among customers living in the North was noted by many in business on both sides.One northern businessman who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of offending his customers said: “Southerners are more obedient. The Northern Catholic mentality is to break the rules because they have been living under British rule for so long. Northern Protestants don’t break the rules.”One woman running a seaside cafe in west Donegal complained that “no matter how many signs you had on the door”, a lot of northern visitors had to be reminded to put on masks.“And many would say ‘why?’. You would get very smart remarks. We had to start leaving facemasks at the door,” she says. “At the start we didn’t charge but then some would take five or six so we charged €1 each.”She found younger customers to be more co-operative, offering to eat outside or in their cars if they didn’t have proof of vaccination.“The middle-aged were the ones arguing, saying things like ‘you are in the middle of nowhere here, do you really think the guards will come in?’. We did have to turn a lot of people away.”Hospitality isn’t the only area where the rules have been causing irritation. Patience is wearing thin among the GAA fraternity and one club in Letterkenny has a reason to be particularly aggrieved. Croke Park recently issued updated rules but still only six people a time are permitted into dressing rooms. Rugby clubs have no such restrictions.Letterkenny Gaels share a clubhouse with Letterkenny rugby club but while they squelch their way home in wet gear after training, their rugby playing neighbours are enjoying the comfort of dressing rooms and hot showers.“We train at the same time in the same rain but we can’t shower afterwards,” says one local GAA player.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"my budget i don t know how they expect people to afford homes when there is no housing stock at all","story":"Mary Claire O’Sullivan, Irish Rail driver. Photograph: Tom Honan for The .Mary-Claire O’Sullivan (37) is a train driver on the Connolly-Sligo and Dublin commuter routes. Her priority is to buy a home in Dublin, from where she can get to work at Connolly station quickly given she sometimes starts at 5am.She has been saving for more than two years, and watched houses she thought she could have afforded spiral out of her price range.“With my deposit, I got approval for €160,000 to €165,000… I have looked a bit further out from Raheny and Kilbarrack, but everything has become unaffordable for me.”She applied for the help-to-buy scheme but was approved for just €6,000, and has to spend it on a new-build.“And yet the Government are still allowing companies to buy up whole areas. I don’t know how they expect people to afford homes. There is no housing stock at all. I am going for mortgage approval again in the new year.”She wanted to see help for first-time buyers, especially those who have to live in Dublin to be close to work for anti-social shifts, and a vacant property tax. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said on Tuesday the Government would review its help-to-buy scheme for first-time buyers next year, after confirming that the programme would be extended beyond the end of 2021 into next year.“It is heart-breaking to see properties in the middle of town, prime retail estate which could be homes, lying derelict,” Ms O’Sullivan says.On working on through the pandemic, she recalls “a lot of tension” on trains at the start.“We were bringing a lot of frontline workers to work. There were some people not adhering to the rules, not wearing masks, and people were looking for more policing, pulling emergency chords or using the emergency intercoms when people weren’t wearing masks. But it settled down.” – KH‘Not worth talking about’Lorry driver Stephen Smyth thinks the Government could have gone further to help people managing the rising cost of living in the budget, particularly those who cannot work from home.The 30-year-old Co Louth man is building his own home outside Dundalk and is managing the rising cost of building materials along with the rising cost of diesel in order to get to work.The small benefits offered in the budget, more take-home pay for workers and increases of €5 to €10 on various allowances, do not go far enough for him.“I know they are giving a bit of an increase but it is not worth talking about. For a family struggling to get by, what addition would €5 or €10 be to a family. I don’t think it is any addition. What they are talking about is ridiculous. You wouldn’t give a fiver to a child,” he said.“What they are talking about is pennies when people’s backs are against the wall. I don’t find it useful at all.”Smyth sees the carbon tax rise, putting an additional €1.48 on the cost of a full tank of diesel, as being a penalty on people who cannot work from home where remote workers are receiving the benefit of tax relief on expenses they incur from working at home.“The budget is more helping the people working from home than the people who have to travel. There is no reward for people who have to travel up and down to Dublin,” he said.“That person sitting at home gets tax back. Builders and lorry drivers, people who cannot work from home, they are not saving anything. It is costing them more to go to work.”He plans to reduce his personal spending now to cover the higher costs and is concerned about the cost of energy, which has “gone through the roof”.“I would be far more worried about the time when I move into my house and what the price of electricity is going to be in six months’ time,” he said.“It is all a worry down the line.” –\u0026nbspSC‘Are you actually kidding me?’Beautician Lisa O’Shea does not see the budget helping her situation.A tenant of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in her home town of Cahirsiveen, Co Kerry, the 38-year-old single mother of one says she is facing homelessness because the house she has lived in for the past 12 years has been sold in an online auction.She tried to buy the house having saved for a deposit over the years for a mortgage from her local Credit Union but the borrowing limit meant she was outbid by €6,000 when the house was sold in an online auction for €135,000, well in excess of the €90,000 asking price.“The budget is not going to help me. Absolutely not,” she said.“I heard Paschal Donohoe talking about the country facing a ‘better and brighter future’ –\u0026nbspoh my God, are you actually kidding me? I don’t see it making any difference to my life.”The benefit from the higher tax cut-off and higher tax credits –\u0026nbspabout €350 per year for the average worker - will not offset the increasing cost of electricity and fuel.“It is not enough. With the way the cost of electricity has gone up, car fuel has gone nuts, home fuel has gone nuts, that €350 wouldn’t last candlelight,” she said.Plans to build 4,000 new affordable purchase homes and 9,500 new social homes by 2025 offer O’Shea no immediate help in her predicament.She would like to see the Government go much further by buying and turning vacant and derelict properties in rural towns into residential homes for people looking for homes.She says she cannot understand why the Government plans to deliver another 14,000 HAP tenancies, arguing the money should be going into building or buying social housing or helping people in HAP-rented properties to buy their own homes.“They are going to further encourage the system that is for people to buy up houses and rent them rather than giving people the opportunity to buy their own houses,” she said.“For me I just think I am never going to buy a home. I just can’t see it happening.” –\u0026nbspSC‘Bread crumbs all ’round’Alex Homits (28) who works in a supermarket in Tallaght, earning “just above the minimum wage”, describes Budget 2022 as “bread crumbs all ’round”.He says he experienced high rents and an eviction in the private rented sector, and he is now sharing with a friend where his rent is “reasonable”.Nevertheless, he says, “between paying for gas and electricity metres, food –\u0026nbspthe bills still eat up a high proportion of our collective incomes”.He will not see any increase in his weekly income, unless his employer increases pay in line with the increase in the minimum wage which will go up from €10.20 an hour to €10.50 next year.He does not qualify for the fuel allowance, and so will not benefit from the increase of €5 per week. He wants to see a cap introduced on gas and electricity prices.He says wages in the grocery sector, especially for new entrants, are “probably too low for a sustainable life” and would like to see the introduction of a statutory ‘living wage’ of about €14 to €15 an hour .“The Budget is just the same old, same old. The €5 increases won’t even match inflation. It’s farcical. I think all working people expected this is the kind of budget they’d roll out with a ide-and-conquer approach. There are a few increases for some age groups and very little for working people. For really all of us low-paid, over-worked people, this is not going to lift morale.”In health, again as a lower-paid worker, he neither qualifies for a medical card nor can afford private health insurance. He wants to see urgent roll-out of Sláintecare, to end what he describes as a “three tier” health system.‘Nothing in it for renters’Ben Fraser has been working from home since February but feels the Government could have helped people out in other ways, rather than offering tax relief on remote working expenses.The digital marketing executive will be one of the many remote workers who can avail of an income tax deduction of up to 30 per cent of heat, electricity and broadband expenses.Previously, remote workers could deduct 10 per cent of heat and electricity expenses and 30 per cent of broadband costs. It is now 30 per cent for all three. The measure is being put on a legislative basis – a recognition that remote working will be part of working lives post-pandemic.Fraser has only returned to the office for an occasional working day in recent weeks but does not see the tax relief as being a huge benefit when people face much bigger costs.“It sounds nice but in real terms and also in more philosophical terms it doesn’t really mean much,” he said.For renters like him in Dublin city centre, Fraser, who is in his late 20s, believes that the Government should have done something more meaningful for people by addressing the rising cost of rent, car insurance or healthcare.The fact that there was not a “symbolic gesture” from the Government to signal that it was at least trying to deal with a “completely broken rental market” was “incredible politically, never mind morally or otherwise”.“My main expenses are not taxation. The worries around expenses generally come from rent and other expenses,” he said.“The fact that there is nothing in it for renters and things like car insurance or health care that cost real money and fluctuate more dramatically seems counter-productive.”More generally, he believes that the Government should not have reduced taxes for the highest earners in the country.“The moment we are in doesn’t feel like a moment to cut taxes for people who have been largely protected by their employers through the crisis,” he said.“The idea that I need tax relief now when there is expenditure required in health and housing is a misalignment of priorities right now.” –\u0026nbspSC‘It is really hard to live in Dublin’Somy Thomas (45), a clinical nurse manager in a private hospital, does not see anything “helpful” in Budget 2022.From Kerala in south India, she has been in Ireland for 17 years, and has four children under 13. Her husband had to give up his job in financial services to look after the children due to the cost of childcare. They are renting a three-bedroom house in north Dublin – and are “so lucky to have a very nice landlord” –\u0026nbspbut would like to buy a house. She brings home between €3,500 and €3,800 a month, depending on the shifts she works.“I know I get a decent salary compared to many people but I feel it is really hard to live in Dublin. I don’t know how people are going to survive with the expenses going up.”On housing, she says: “There is nothing in this budget that stands out. I didn’t see anything to help. We have been trying to buy a house in Dublin but I don’t think it is possible for us. Affordable housing is €400,000 in Dublin. It’s a joke. It looks like if we want to buy a home we will have to move out of Dublin.“The income taxes changes, I don’t think they are enough because whatever I get we will have to pay more for other things.”Announcements on childcare, to keep costs static for parents, were “vague” she says, and she would like to hear more details.“For my husband to go back to work we would need childcare, but I don’t know how anything announced is going to help us.”Noting an announcement that there would be 7,000 new posts in healthcare, she is dubious. “The new grads are leaving the country. I know there is overseas recruitment to attract workers to Ireland but when they land in Dublin it’s a mess for them, with the housing and everything.”\u0026nbsp– KHStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"america needs political waverers like sinema and manchin","story":" Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema: an enigma in US politics. Photograph: Stefani ReynoldsThe New York TimesIn her 2009 treatise, Unite and Conquer, Kyrsten Sinema suggests “letting go of the bear and picking up the Buddha”. An English translation, which is yet to appear, would render this as something like “spurning tribalism for co-operation”. Her overtures to Republicans come from a “place of peace”. The now senator for Arizona burbles on like this for almost 200 pages.Faced with her vision of politics, most Democrats come from a place of nausea. Bipartisanship, after all, is not an end in itself. The middle view on a subject is not always wise. With a rare chance to grow America’s welfare state, the party is blocked by Sinema and the yet more Republican-friendly Joe Manchin of West Virginia.F Scott Fitzgerald defined a first-rate mind as one that can hold opposing ideas at the same time. To pass his test, the Democratic party has to accept that “Sinemanchin” are wrong, that their obstinacy could scupper Joe Biden’s presidency – and that the United States needs them regardless.First to their wrongness. Sinema tends not to name her objections to the Build Back Better bill. Manchin is a tad less cagey but no more persuasive. He wants bespoke help for the poor, not an “entitlement society” of universal largesse. The inference is that free childcare and community colleges, among other Biden plans, fall into the second trap.Even on its own centrist terms, this line is perverse. The social programmes with cross-party backing, such as Medicare, are open to almost all. The least popular, namely welfare, are means-tested. As in Britain, where tax credits are easy game but the NHS untouchable, it is the universal state that has right-wing buy-in. Most Republican voters would rather raise taxes than cut federal entitlements. As such, Manchin’s is a strange kind of bipartisanship.Democratic grievances with the two senators don’t end there. Public debt, or what Manchin calls “fiscal insanity”, is real. But it was he and Sinema who opposed bigger tax rises. Then there is that almost regal hesitation to be drawn on specifics. It is hard to avoid the thought that, for both senators, the basis of their opposition matters less than the fact of it. Bucking a Democratic president is what sells in a deep red state (West Virginia) and parts of a purple one (Arizona). How it is achieved is secondary.The case against the pair would be unanswerable, in fact, were it not for one thing. In a riven nation, it just happens to be all that matters.One thread holding the US together is the existence of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans. If all they do is humanise and demystify their parties for opposition voters, it is a public service like no other. Their views on policy pale next to their civilising role in the wider system. Sinema and Manchin are emissaries to Red America. Susan Collins and Charlie Baker do the same for the GOP in liberal New England. It is a mark of civic rot that I could name all such transgressive figures without testing this column’s word limit.There are 19 “blue dog” Democrats in the House of Representatives. More than 50 were elected in 2008. That year will also be the last in which a Republican presidential hopeful is as pro-immigration, or as gracious towards Barack Obama, as John McCain. A once-normal heterodoxy (Nelson Rockefeller, metro-Republican, made it to vice-president) has become career-ending. What the parties have gained in coherence, the country has lost in civic peace.Sinema is an – maybe the – enigma in US politics. Green peacenik to blue dog in 15 years, her intellectual odyssey has outpaced even her material rise. (It is disputed whether there was running water in her childhood home.) Raised as a Mormon, she is now the one member of Congress with no professed religion.To be so protean is to arouse mistrust. But politics has enough people who find their tribe around the age of 18 and call off the search. It is the changelings and waverers who act as nodes between the two Americas, or who recognise how many more there really are.Democrats are right that she and Manchin are relics. Each recalls a time when it wasn’t possible to guess someone’s region, accent, education, tastes or even opinions from the fact of their party registration. The independence that allows them to win red states, however, is the independence that chokes Build Back Better. The Democrats (would they prefer a Republican Senate?) win from the trade-off. So does a country whose trend to ever purer parties evokes the enrichment of fissile material. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"blinded groupthink does keep happening anything can do stop","story":"It is the early months of 1961, and some of the world’s most renowned strategic brains have gathered at the White House to discuss what they view as a new contagion – not a virus, but revolutionary Communism, which they fear will rip across the world. The most pressing outbreak is in Cuba, just overrun by Fidel Castro.The Americans mulling a response include the famously able Robert McNamara, the historian Arthur Schlesinger, the special operations veteran and CIA chief Allen Dulles, and of course the young president, JFK, and his brother Bobby. In total, dozens of brilliant minds relentlessly plot and plan.Their answer: the Bay of Pigs, one of the most notorious foreign policy fiascos of the 20th century, an operation so inept, so hare-brained, it now seems inconceivable that it was ever given the green light by anyone, let alone a contingent of the most eminent thinkers on the planet.“There were 50 or so of us, presumably the most experienced and smartest people we could get,” Kennedy later recalled. “Five minutes after it began to fall in, we all looked at each other and asked: ‘How could we have been so stupid?’ When we saw the wide range of the failures we asked ourselves why it had not been apparent to somebody from the start.”The answer, of course, was ‘groupthink’ – that blanket of camaraderie that smothers clear analysis, as members of a tight-knit band strive to preserve group cohesion above all else, prizing their place in the club more than anything, suppressing their own doubts and silencing those of others, while leaping to conclusions without proper evaluation and data.So neatly does the word groupthink express this concept that it is tempting to believe it has always existed. But it was not until more than a decade after the Bay of Pigs, in 1972, that Irving Janis, a psychologist at Yale University, coined the term, leaning on the dystopian ‘doublethink’ of Orwell’s 1984, which the author described menacingly as “to know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies”.Today groupthink is back, the term peppered throughout the latest, damning, joint report of Parliament’s Health and Social Care and Science and Technology Committees into the pandemic, which blames it for a cosy yet lethal consensus between scientists and Government ministers in the early months of 2020. The top brains all agreed, essentially, that it was pointless fighting the coming pandemic. Infections would be unstoppable, whatever the cost. The group, seeking quick and comfortable unanimity, soon settled on the inevitably of herd immunity, when what was required was a little immunity from the No. 10 herd.  It shouldn’t have been that hard to do. The knee-jerk response was based on planning for a flu pandemic, simply because flu had long been the outbreak deemed most likely to strike Britain. Even calm and rational minds outside the room, like Jeremy Hunt, admit to suffering. “There was a groupthink that it should be tackled like a flu pandemic,” he said on Tuesday. No one dared to stand up and point out the astonishingly simple fact that Covid was not caused by an influenza virus, but a coronavirus.If they had, it is clear, that initial, fatalistic laissez-faire policy, waved passively into being by “presumably the most experienced and smartest people we could get” would have been shelved much earlier. Instead of mirroring policy in Europe and North America, where the flu fallacy was just as dominant, we might have turned to South East Asia, site of two coronavirus epidemics in the past 20 years, to see what they were doing: early lockdown, border control, track and trace. According to the former Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Dame Sally Davies: “Quite simply, we were in groupthink. Our infectious disease experts really did not believe that SARS, or another SARS, would get from Asia to us.” And the politicians did not challenge the experts.It is easy to understand why. Standing out comes at a cost. Janis describes how, as the in-group of decision-makers settles on its preferred interpretation of events, it cloaks itself and its chosen path with morality. Dissenters become not just wrong, but somehow evil. Members of the club, meanwhile, are intoxicated by an image of themselves as both right and virtuous.Once such groupthink is identified and demolished, however, it is all too easy for a new, opposing orthodoxy to become established in its place. Thus the fallout from the delayed first lockdown – with its lack of PPE and its NHS evacuation of infected pensioners into care homes to seed the disease among the most frail – seamlessly morphed into a happy advocacy of subsequent lockdowns, even as data began to pile up showing that the young and fit were overwhelmingly spared the disease’s worst effects, or that shutting schools and playgrounds was far more damaging in the round than keeping them open. An irony began to emerge: groupthink – which historians have often credited dictators with deploying to whip up crowds and drive revolutions – was now being pressed into service to subdue the nation and keep its people off the streets. Lockdown did not prove a panacea. New variants emerged – first Kent, then Delta – just as vaccines came on line to draw new battle lines. Stopping transmission became secondary to preventing severe illness. New cases became less important than hospitalisations.And the UK’s 213 days of national lockdown, over three spells, longer than almost anywhere in the world, including much of Australia, took on new context, as hidden costs began to emerge – the tens of thousands of undetected cancers, the countless classes of lost schooling – opportunities lost and shortened lives that are still being counted today, and whose bill will continue to rise in the years to come.  Of course, hindsight is wonderful, and it can be hard to distinguish between destructive consensus and simple ignorance or ineptitude. Maybe those around the table in March 2020 didn’t have the facts or didn’t know what they were doing. The groupthink narrative is, it will surprise no one to learn, in part driven by Dominic Cummings, always keen to portray himself as the brilliant iconoclast. His closest peer is probably Anders Tegnell, the Swedish state epidemiologist who set his country on a very different Covid path to its neighbours. While Cummings stood up for lockdown, Tegnell became something of a celebrity for persisting with the anti-lockdown strategy that Britain eventually abandoned. Some there now think blind respect for Tegnell’s contrarianism became a kind of Swedish government groupthink of its own.Because in the end, the two strategies began to meet in the middle, as Sweden was forced to toughen its easygoing approach, and other countries made to realise that the disease was not eradicable, but endemic. In Australia and New Zealand, the lockdown doctrine is only now crumbling.Groupthink, though, has made its mark. Sweden has suffered 1,467 Covid deaths per million people, three times the number in Denmark and almost 10 times that in Norway. South Korea, veteran of SARS, has had just 50 Covid deaths per million. Britain has had more than 2,000.And whatever the claims of Cummings or Tegnell, it is usually not a lone prophet who leads us all through confusion and darkness to the light.Just a year and a half after the Bay of Pigs, in October 1962, news reached the White House that Moscow was placing nuclear missiles on Cuba. Kennedy’s top brass called for a huge strike to destroy the missiles. But Kennedy, who had instigated a wide-ranging inquiry into the catastrophe of 18 months before, drew on its conclusions to demand a new kind of decision making. The rules were simple: everyone had to be sceptical, there would be different groups working on alternatives which each would present to the other and even swap, and these options would often be worked up outside the White House, or away from JFK himself, so that formality of setting and follow-the-leader do not block free thinking. This time, Bobby Kennedy described discussions as “completely uninhibited”. The initial drift towards potentially world-ending military strikes gave way to the idea of a naval blockade.Reform, it turns out, is possible. Groups can avoid groupthink. More from NewsPolice officer had sex with woman while investigating her, probe findsScrap social distancing and see more patients, GPs will be toldDecades-long drop in life expectancy leaves the North more exposed to CovidGP practice shuts its doors to thousands of patients after insurance blunderTowns told to \u0026#39adapt or die\u0026#39 in face of flooding riskEddie Redmayne criticised for taking ‘queer’ role in Cabaret revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains energy vulnerability plays straight chinas hands","story":"In the mid 2000s, Britain went from being a net energy exporter to being a net importer. And that has remained the case ever since. There are plenty of reasons for this unedifying reversal of fortunes, but most importantly, in their rush to decarbonise, our leaders have failed to anticipate the continuing need for fossil fuel reserves.Why, for example, has this Government only granted one licence for development of the Jackdaw field (a gascondensate development in the North Sea) since 2016? Worse, why has the The Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) reportedly refused to approve that licence? Why do we import so much when it seems clear that the UK still has sufficient known gas reserves for at least the next twenty years, and when we have the opportunity to pursue low cost shale gas exploration?This failure to grant new licences combined with our dependence on oil imported from unreliable regimes has made us more vulnerable to price spikes, particularly when at the same time we have decommissioned lots of our storage facilities. It makes you wonder who has been doing the vital strategic thinking, if any has indeed been done. The ambition to increase the proportion of renewable energy is a noble objective, but policy makers must recognise that while we get there, energy security is no less vital. The lights and heating need to remain on and industry needs energy supplies available at reasonable prices. Furthermore, as we look to develop hydrogen as an genuine and reliable alternative to gas, we will still need gas. The problem is that governments are at the same time putting pressure on fossil fuel companies to cut their investment in carbon fuel resources, leading to energy spikes as investment in oil and gas production falls quicker than demand. Underscoring all that, we are decommissioning generation capacity as though we have already arrived at full renewable generation. Since 2010, 20 per cent of the UK’s generation capacity has closed. And by 2024, five of the U.K.’s eight nuclear plants will be shut.In short, our reliance on imported energy, without reserves and shipped on a “just in time basis”, has left us vulnerable. And, most worryingly of all, that vulnerability plays into China’s hands. Already, we are dependent on China for our new nuclear building programme and much of our batteries, wind turbines and solar energy. And, even when we get close to net zero, energy spikes won’t go away. Market volatility will move from fossil fuel to the demand for rare earth materials - the lion’s share of which are owned and produced by China. China’s rapacious demand for gas and coal is driving the current energy spike: Beijing has ordered state-owned energy companies “to do whatever it takes” to secure fuel supplies, putting further pressure on the price of gas paid by already struggling UK energy suppliers.It is peculiar that we carry on being so dependent on a country that - amongst other nightmarish behaviour - regularly trashes the global trading rules. Surely it is time we set out to cut our dependence on deeply unreliable China, a country which clearly has no intention of meeting even their own weak obligations concerning net zero. What is required now is proper strategic thinking about our energy requirements. Even as we pursue net zero, our energy policy must remain balanced, affordable and most of all, secure.More from NewsPolice officer had sex with woman while investigating her, probe findsScrap social distancing and see more patients, GPs will be toldDecades-long drop in life expectancy leaves the North more exposed to CovidGP practice shuts its doors to thousands of patients after insurance blunderTowns told to \u0026#39adapt or die\u0026#39 in face of flooding riskEddie Redmayne criticised for taking ‘queer’ role in Cabaret revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown had marginal effect telegraph readers governments covid","story":"The first major report into the UK\u0027s pandemic response has concluded that Britain did not lock down sooner because ministers failed to challenge poor scientific advice. The error led to one of the most important public health failures the UK has ever experienced and resulted in a higher death toll, MPs have said.The joint report by the Government’s health and science select committees found that many mistakes were made in the early days of the outbreak, which have only been redeemed by the successful vaccination programme.Readers took to the comments to discuss their thoughts on the report and the handling of the Government’s response to the pandemic in hindsight. Read on to see what your fellow readers had to say and share your view in the comments section at the bottom of this article.Scientific advice will advise for the pathology of Covid, its transmission and how to combat it.On top of that, and this is why we have an elected government, there are decisions to be made for the social and economic impacts which require a different kind of advice and, more importantly, common sense. Otherwise, we may as well have Chris Whitty as a prime minister.The \u0027too late\u0027 government\u0027s theme is to do nothing until panic creeps in. They do not need a public enquiry for that they will save money by asking people on the street.The UK’s timing on lockdown - relative to when the disease was detected in the country - was very similar to France and Germany. Until Italy announced lockdown, I’m not sure any Western country thought it would be enforceable here.In terms of lives saved and lost due to various decisions, I just don’t think it will ever be possible to calculate that with any accuracy.Where is the evidence that lockdown even worked? We had several lengthy lockdowns and still ended up as one of the most badly affected countries.If we were to speculate deaths would have been much higher without lockdown one would need to justify how the UK could end up as such an outlier with death rates many times more than other countries that had no lockdown.Surely the only logical conclusion is that lockdown had only a marginal effect.I still believe that if we had done nothing it would have made no difference at all.Lockdown was unnecessary and has been the cause of a far worse pandemic of missed hospital appointments, cancer diagnosis etc.Plus, the devastating effect on our economy. We should never have had any of the draconian measures put in place. They are what should go down in history as the biggest mistakes ever made.\u0027Ministers failed to challenge poor scientific advice\u0027 is pretty unreasonable. Scientists provide scientific advice, ministers make decisions based on that.The comment about closing the borders seems to overlook the statement by Mr Vallance that as the virus was already here, closing the borders would serve no useful purpose. That was the scientific assessment, subsequently changed as the situation worsened.In terms of preparedness, if the UK response was based on an influenza virus, and we and the US came out on top in the Johns Hopkins assessment, what did other countries plan for?Test and Trace was clearly not a success, and the waste of £37 billion was one of the greatest failures in the pandemic.This is what happens when the Government investigates themselves we get the answer they have been priming us for, and the answer that the gullible public are going to swallow wholeheartedly. So, exactly as expected, all politicians are in the clear, and fully in support of the ongoing narrative and future lockdowns as and when they desire.Now, when is the independent enquiry happening? The one where all options are considered by truly independent people. The enquiry that would also consider what happened in places such as Sweden.How exactly was the Government to know that it was \u0027bad scientific advice\u0027? They followed the science and would have been equally criticised if they hadn\u0027t.This report shows nothing that common sense hasn\u0027t been screaming from the very beginning... from before the pandemic and operation cygnet.What the vaccine innovation has shown us is that politics is dead. We need to be run by people who can see breadth and depth and look to the best in skills and knowledge to lead, not what currently happens where we have MPs who call on their mates or lovers to make this country great. Shambles.With the benefit of hindsight, things may have turned out differently.Why hasn\u0027t the committee looked at the damaging effects of scientific advice given throughout the pandemic? Not one of the models proved to be anywhere near reality.Lockdowns have proved to be a very blunt instrument which has led to economic disaster, mental health problems and large numbers of undiagnosed serious illnesses other than Covid. The scientists have some serious questions to answer.Hindsight is an exact science. Of course mistakes were made. But, overall, the UK has fared better than most countries throughout the pandemic. And the vaccination programme has been efficient, practical and effective. A thoroughly professional job.Lockdown probably causes more problems (undiagnosed serious illnesses and delayed herd immunity) than it averts.More from NewsPolice officer had sex with woman while investigating her, probe findsScrap social distancing and see more patients, GPs will be toldDecades-long drop in life expectancy leaves the North more exposed to CovidGP practice shuts its doors to thousands of patients after insurance blunderTowns told to \u0026#39adapt or die\u0026#39 in face of flooding riskEddie Redmayne criticised for taking ‘queer’ role in Cabaret revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day spectacular military planes flypast north korea","story":"Military planes perform a flypast during the Defence Development Exhibition, in Pyongyang, North KoreaPolice officer had sex with woman while investigating her, probe findsScrap social distancing and see more patients, GPs will be toldDecades-long drop in life expectancy leaves the North more exposed to CovidGP practice shuts its doors to thousands of patients after insurance blunderTowns told to \u0026#39adapt or die\u0026#39 in face of flooding riskEddie Redmayne criticised for taking ‘queer’ role in Cabaret revivalHuman trafficking victims can work and claim benefits in UK following High Court rulingMan accused of planning mosque attack had Hitler \u0026#39infatuation\u0026#39, says motherBrussels to offer new Brexit deal for Northern IrelandDiscount on buying electric cars could be cut with Cop26 on horizonComment: Lockdown delay was understandable, but the energy crisis is unforgivableArmy to look to football events for advice on crowd control in wake of Kabul evacuationOver-60s should not take aspirin regularly to prevent heart attacks, say doctorsQueen uses walking stick for first time in 17 years as she attends Westminster AbbeyBritain to invest £1bn in African ports as part of Western response to ChinaScotland suffers highest winter death toll in two decades, as calls for inquiry growAnti-drugs spray on trial in pubs leaves cocaine users in sticky situationDuke and Duchess of Sussex put their money where their mouth is with ‘ethical investment’Watch: Locals catch residents jumping from a burning apartment in IstanbulMatt Hancock appointed as United Nations special representative for AfricaJack the Ripper running tours stumble into uproar over ‘exploitation’ of women victimsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan invest financial markets put values action","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they are putting their “values into action” by becoming “impact partners” with an asset management company which invests heavily in social media giants Facebook and Twitter.The Sussexes have invested in New York-based company Ethic, which helps customers direct their money towards companies “that treat people and the planet with respect”.The Duke and Duchess have previously campaigned against the dark side of social media, working alongside campaign group Stop Hate for Profit and lobbying major corporations to withdraw advertising spending from “lawless” social media companiesLast year, Prince Harry wrote a 1,400-word column in which he said the cost of using social media was “very high”, with personal data traded for profit in a “relatively lawless space”.On Tuesday, the couple announced they had invested in fintech asset manager Ethic, saying they “want to rethink the nature of investing to help solve the global issues we all face”.“We believe it’s time for more people to have a seat at the table when decisions are made that impact everyone,” they said. “This is one of the ways we put our values in action.”Ethic has $6.9 million (£5 million) invested in Facebook shares, making it the company\u0027s thirteenth-biggest investment, according to a recent US filing.It also has a $32 million stake in Alphabet, the parent company of YouTube-owner Google, and a $2m investment in Twitter.Investing their own money through Ethic could mean the couple owning stakes in the tech giants, although the company does allow investors to build personalised investment portfolios that can opt out of owning certain companies or sectors.In an interview with the New York Times announcing their new deal, the Sussexes made a contrast between the upbringing of Prince Harry and Meghan.The Duchess said: “From the world I come from, you don’t talk about investing, right? You don’t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy.”But, she added: “My husband has been saying for years, ‘Gosh, don’t you wish there was a place where if your values were aligned like this, you could put your money to that same sort of thing?’”Prince Harry told the newspaper: “You already have the younger generation voting with their dollars and their pounds, you know, all over the world when it comes to brands they select and choose from.”The Duke, who is the Queen\u0027s grandson, and Meghan left the working Royal Family in January 2020, and are now pursuing financial independence in California.The couple are said to hope that their involvement in Ethic “would help democratise investing, making people - especially younger people - more deliberate in their choices and conscious of investing in sustainable companies.”Announcing the new asset management partnership, Ethic founders said they hoped the involvement of the Sussexes would see their vision “reach many millions around the globe”.“They’re deeply committed to helping address the defining issues of our time - such as climate, gender equity, health, racial justice, human rights, and strengthening democracy - and understand that these issues are inherently interconnected,” they said.“So much so, in fact, that they became investors in Ethic earlier this year and have investments managed by Ethic as well.“Now they want to shine a light on how we can all impact the causes that affect our communities, bring transparency into how the corporate world sets the tone and shapes outcomes for everyday families, and believe that more people should have a seat at the table when it comes to making progress.”Founded in 2015 by three white men who are now in their 30s, Ethic is self-described as a “erse team” which “helps wealth advisors demystify the world of sustainable investing and engage in meaningful values-driven conversations with their clients”.More from NewsPolice officer had sex with woman while investigating her, probe findsScrap social distancing and see more patients, GPs will be toldDecades-long drop in life expectancy leaves the North more exposed to CovidGP practice shuts its doors to thousands of patients after insurance blunderTowns told to \u0026#39adapt or die\u0026#39 in face of flooding riskEddie Redmayne criticised for taking ‘queer’ role in Cabaret revivalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rolling stones blues cover band says sir paul mccartney","story":"Sir Paul McCartney has described the Rolling Stones as a blues cover band and claimed The Beatles tapped into a wider array of musical influences.The singer said our net was cast a bit wider than theirs when it came to making music, in an apparent dig at the band popularly considered to be The Beatles’ rivals, but added: I\u0027m not sure I should say it.His comments, in an interview with The New Yorker, could provoke another response from Sir Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones\u0027 frontman, after the pair traded words over their legacies in jest last year.Sir Paul said in an interview with Howard Stern last April that the Stones were rooted in the blues and The Beatles were better, prompting Sir Mick to respond in a separate interview: One band is unbelievably luckily still playing in stadiums and then the other band doesn\u0027t exist.The Beatles and The Rolling Stones – two of the most successful bands of all time – were often framed as feuding with each other during the 1960s but were actually on friendly terms.In his latest interview, Sir Paul was questioned about the sophisticated compositions of many Beatles\u0027 songs, which have drawn praise from experts on classical music.Asked whether the band worked from a broader range of musical language than others such as the Stones, he replied: I\u0027m not sure I should say it, but they\u0027re a blues cover band, that\u0027s sort of what the Stones are. I think our net was cast a bit wider than theirs.It comes after Sir Paul this week blamed John Lennon for the demise of The Beatles in a separate interview with the BBC.Sir Paul has often been viewed as the driving force behind the band\u0027s split in 1970 after he revealed in a press release for his solo album that he was on a break from them.But he told a forthcoming episode of BBC Radio 4’s This Cultural Life: I didn\u0027t instigate the split.

The study, from the cross-party Science and Technology Committee and the Health and Social Care Committee, said the UK’s preparation for a pandemic was far too focused on flu, while ministers waited too long to push through lockdown measures in early . In a wide-ranging report, MPs said the UK’s pandemic planning was too “narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model” that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. Here are eight key findings from the report:Preparedness The Governmentaposs pandemic planning was too narrowly and inflexibly based on a flu model that failed to learn the lessons from Sars, Mers and Ebola. The national risk register predicted that the likelihood of an emerging infectious disease spreading within the UK was lower than that of a flu pandemic, with only up to  people dying. The report recommended that experts from abroad should help draw up plans while specialists should scan the horizon for future threats. Army logistics experts should play a more central role in preparing for pandemics. Herd immunity While allowing people to become infected early on to reach herd immunity was not an official Government strategy, there was a policy approach of fatalism about the spread of the virus. This led to a strategy of only trying to moderate the speed of infection through the population - flattening the curve - rather than stopping its spread. SAGE experts believed completely suppressing the virus would cause a second peak.Lockdowns Ministers took a gradual and incremental approach to restrictions such as social distancing, isolation and lockdowns and MPs said it was astonishing that it took so long for them to realise this was a catastrophically wrong decision that would dramatically increase the death toll. There was a  belief the public would not accept a lockdown and lack of testing meant there was little data on Covid spread. Ministers ignored scientic advice for a two-week circuit breaker in autumn which could have saved thousands of lives and meant there was a month-long lockdown - apart from schools - in November instead. The PM announced a third lockdown on January  . Restrictions The Government was too slow to bring in self-isolation rules while light-touch border controls only on countries with high Covid rates meant the arrival of more cases from countries like France and Spain. Regional tiers brought in last October were not watertight enough to prevent infection spreading. Scientic evidence for measures like the pm curfew on pubs was lacking. Tougher social distancing measures last autumn could have stopped the spread of the Alpha iant across the country and saved more lives.  Social care Social care had a less prominent voice in Government in the early stages of the pandemic than did the NHS. The decision not to test people being discharged from hospitals to care homes early on was a failure and led to deaths in care homes. Staff shortages, the lack of testing and dficulties in obtaining PPE all hampered isolation and infection control. The social care sector remains drastically in need of funding and reform - or it will be at risk from future pandemics. Health inequalities There were unacceptably high death rates among people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, the MPs concluded. Increased exposure to Covid as a result of peopleaposs housing and working conditions played a signicant role. BAME staff in the NHS, often in more junior positions, faced greater dficulty getting appropriate PPE equipment. There were also disproportionately high mortality rates among people with learning dficulties and autism - in part because of pre-existing health conditions but also dficulties accessing care. The experience of the covid pandemic underlines the need for an urgent and long term strategy to tackle health inequalities, they concluded.  Testing The slow, uncertain, and often chaotic performance of the £ billion test, trace and isolate system severely hampered the UKaposs response to the pandemic, the MPs found. Test and trace failed in its stated objective to prevent future lockdowns - despite vast quantities of taxpayersapos money. The report concluded were it not for the NHS vaccines programme further lockdown restrictions would have been needed in summer . Vaccines MPs praised ministers for identying that a vaccine would be a long-term route out of the pandemic and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance for setting up the Vaccines Taskforce to procure jabs. The Government was right to support vaccine research and development, including the Oxford AstraZeneca jab, while the NHS successfully handled the roll-out of the programme, with over % of the adult population jabbed by September . But the conclusion that the vaccine programme has redeemed many of the Governmentaposs other failings - which resulted in , deaths - will be controversial.

Professor Christina Pagel - director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at UCL, and member of Independent SAGE The House of Commons report on the lessons learned to date on Coronavirus is damning on the UK response. On the initial response in , the report highlighted four main failings. Those were: ignoring the advice and experience from the WHO and other countries where Covid hit first. Instead of scaling up our testing capacity we reduced it, so we didn’t know where and how it was spreading. We made assumptions about what level of response the British public would accept, which were not based on any evidence and turned out to be entirely wrong.  And finally, we didn’t set up a test, trace and isolate system until too late. Even once we did, it was never particularly effective. Instead of preventing infections in the first place, the focus was almost entirely on managing hospital capacity once people got sick. This did nothing to stop spread in the early stages and later led to the terrible decision to discharge elderly patients to care homes without a test, seeding Covid throughout the care home sector and resulting in thousands of deaths. In the end, despite all the advantages we had, the UK set itself up to fail in containing the pandemic, with a sense of fatalism that somehow this was all inevitable. As the report made clear, it was not.  Professor Devi Sridhar - chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh In other countries, the leadership has taken responsibility for the failings of their response to Covid-. Weaposve seen both the Swedish and the Japanese prime ministers resigning over Covid mistakes. Weaposve seen Donald Trump punished at the ballot box with Covid being the top electoral issue in the US. We live in a democracy, so itaposs up for people to look at their leadership and question whether we have the kind of leadership we want. The report is pretty clear and comprehensive on where the UK fell down. It goes into strategy, it goes into implementation and exceptionalism. And it does highlight, in quite a balanced and fair way, where mistakes are made and where improvements need to be made for the future. A positive thing is that we live in a country where MPs are able to distance themselves enough to recognise what went wrong.  Now we need to look at whataposs needed for the next crisis. Iaposm very convinced by the  Day Mission, which aims to have diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics ready to go within  days of a new outbreak. With mRNA vaccine technology, new vaccines can be sequenced and manufactured in a weekend, and then just need to be trialled and distributed. The likelihood is we in the UK are seeing Covid- receding into the background. We might have a bumpy winter but barring a new ient, by the spring we should be feeling in quite a good position with the effective vaccines and boosters rolled out. Poorer countries are probably one to two years behind us so we need to work out how to get enough vaccines to enough people around the world. Science will usually come up with a solution, itaposs just a question of finding enough time to allow those solutions to come forward.

He is understood to have been asked to step down from his role as commander of charity” following the events. But he has escaped censure from the Tories, who will not suspend him from the party. Mr Gray mixed up Iraq-born Mr Zahawi, who wears glasses and has a beard, and clean-shaven Mr Javid, whose family hails from Pakistan. When his error was pointed out, Mr Gray allegedly told guests: “They all look the same to me”. Mr Gray denied saying thisFty invited guests - who included Labour leader Keir Starmer - had been watching Mr Gray onstage, according to MailOnline.Mr Zahawi was reportedly spoke to him privately afterwards, while Mr Javid had not arrived when the incident took place. A St John Ambulance spokesman told the Mirror: “St John does not tolerate racism in any way, shape or form. “We spoke with James Gray following the event about our values as an open, inclusive and progressive charity.” It is understood that the charity has now asked the MP to stand down from all St John Ambulance activity. Mr Gray failed to respond to requests for comment from the Mirror.He told MailOnline he had not said, “They all look the same to me”, but admitted confusing the two ministers.He added: “I said, ‘I am sorry to confuse the two of you. You two look very alike’. I said, ‘I am sorryI got you two mixed up’.” A source told the newspaper: He acknowledged to the audience that his comments werenapost appropriate but in a low-key, jokey way. They added that many of the volunteers were upset. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: These comments were misjudged. We do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind. It comes after Mr Gray was forced to apologise last month for suggesting a bomb should be planted in a Labour MPaposs office. He said he meant no offence with the comment about Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds, which that he posted in a WhatsApp group ahead of Labour conference in Brighton.

Keith Burkman had planned to spend three days at the theme park in Florida, USA last month, but Jenna had to stay home and look after the dogs the couple are breeding. Not wanting to ruin her hubbyaposs fun, Jenna encouraged Keith to go on the trip alone. But he came up with a funny way to keep his we with him in spirit. Before leaving for the trip, Keith made a cardboard cut-out of Jennaaposs face and took her on all the rides with him, so she didnapost miss out. The tech worker from Dallas, Texas, even booked a aposprivate romantic boat rideapos on the Itaposs a Small World ride for himself and the cut out, who he called Mrs Flat We.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here And Jenna didnapost have to worry about her hub getting lonely, as his cardboard cut out drew lots of people towards him and he made plenty of new friends. Dad-of-six Keith said his little stunt was well received by Jenna, who felt loved and appreciated. He explained: Jenna couldnapost come because we breed French Bulldog puppies and we have two litters right now. She was unable to come with me. But she knows that I have a bucket list item - I wanted to do the park all by myself. She was very gracious to offer me a pre-holiday Christmas present allowing me to stay a few extra days and do the park by myself. Knowing his we is also a huge Disney fan, Keith came up with the idea of making the cut out of Jennaaposs head. There was a fear that the cardboard cut-out could go flying out of my hand when I was on these rides. But I kept a tight grip on the stick and the wind didnapost carry her away.  I took most of the pictures as the rides were starting up, but when theyaposd pick up speed, Iaposd have to put her down, he said.Keith posted some of the selfies on Facebook groups for Disney fans, who loved his fun idea.I got some great reactions. Some people whoaposd seen my pictures on Facebook found me in the park and got selfies with me, he said. I even had a cast member recognise me. She pointed at me as I was getting off a ride and said aposItaposs you!apos I just went along with it. She asked aposWhere is Mrs. Flat We apos She thought it was the funniest thing. She then askedIaposd done Itaposs A Small World, and when I said I hadnapost, she took me along the back pass way to the ride. Keith added: I just wanted to include my we in some way. I liked making her feel special for making me feel special. People were very gracious and very friendly. It initiated a lot of conversations and immediately they had to ask me. My entire trip was spent talking to people. Me and Mrs. Flat We met a lot of new people, and had a great time. Disney-obsessed Keith had always wanted to take a solo trip around the park after years of accompanying his young kids on the rides.  He said: The idea behind going alone was that I could decide what rides to go on. All but one of my kids are grown up now, so all of our previous trips to Disney parks have been with children. I always wanted to go on a trip with what I called aposNo kids, no we, no complainingapos.Got a story  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcI also collect Disney memorabilia, so a lot of the fun for me is to go there to take pictures of certain lamp-post signs. I loved spending time looking in areas that I wouldnapost usually, as children usually want to go on all the rides. He joked Jenna thinks he has a small problem because heaposs so obsessed with Disney. Jenna said: I thought it was very sweet when he introduced me to the concept, and it made me feel like I was a part of the trip, even though I had to stay behind with the puppies. And it had me laughing when he was texting me photos of his antics. I wished I was there a ton - and not just my head. But I had the puppies and they had to take precedent. Weaposre scheduled to go again in January - itaposs going to be a family trip. The whole family are Disney lovers.

We quickly ran out of ammunition and food and we were forced to take supplies from those who had passed away, just to make sure we could continue the fight against the Germans. “By day six my two mates on the gun with me were dead, we were exhausted out of ammunition and finally captured and taken off to a prisoner of war camp, we did our best.” Comment MORE ON Operation Market GardenWorld War Veterans of Foreign Wars\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Susan Cotter, , has cared for her grandchildren Jessica, Taylor, Kyle and Millie since her daughter Charlene developed a drug problem and passed away earlier this year. She says she feels abandoned by the system and that her efforts to get a bigger house have received little more than sympathy from authorities. She sleeps on a single bed in the living room of her home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, with her -year-old grandson on the floor, while his ,  and eight-year-old sisters share the small bedrooms.Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror.She told GlasgowLive : “I’m quite a quiet woman and don’t make a fuss about things, but I’ve had no support for myself or these children. There’s nobody helping me, all I get is sympathy but nothing actually done about it.”With Christmas approaching, she faces another year of being unable to offer her grandchildren some much-needed festive joy. After appeals to housing officials, her MP, Glasgow City Council and even the childrenaposs social worker failed, Susan turned to the local paper for help. She said: “I haven’t been able to buy anything for Christmas for the last couple years, apart from anything , there’s just no space in this house. It’s really getting to me. “We have just been left to cope on our own. Where is the care for vulnerable children  Every year is the same and I’m running out of hope. I’ve got a lot of physical problems as well. I am under the shielding category and the children have missed so much school time and had no help with catching up. I’ve wondered how long I can keep my spirits up. The children have a social worker, but it doesn’t seem to help, it’s only sympathy. I need practical help. It just goes on and on. I’m angry and I’m frustrated.” GlasgowLive contacted Susanaposs local councillor Malcolm Balfour who was unaware of her plight and horried to learn sheaposd been offered little help. He has since met with her to see what can be done, but is outraged at the lack of apparent support sheaposs received so far. He said: “Susan is doing a brilliant job raising the children in really dficult circumstances, but it hasnapost been easy for any of them. It would be so easy for them to fall into the same trap as their mum and theyaposre working really hard to stop that from happening. One of the girls is studying for her Highers, she wants to go to university to train to be a midwe, sheaposs a clever and ambitious girl with dreams. It was suggested that she get a place of her own, can you imagine what that would do to that girl, sheaposd never get the chance to fulfil that dream. This family has been through enough, they need practical support, not kind words. He added that he had discussed the situation with Susan’s landlord, Drumchapel Housing Co-operative, and was stunned to learn they canapost help because their biggest properties only have three bedrooms. He added: Itaposs just unbelievable, her family is too big for the biggest house they have, so sheaposs expected just to say in a smaller one. They tell me there are legal reasons for this, but it is just unacceptable. This family needs and deserves our support and theyaposre just not getting it, itaposs not good enough.

Father-of-two David Walker, , was subject to a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguardsorder one year ago, initiated by Hullaposs social services.According toHull Livereports, he claims this was against his will and without his knowledge.For a year, the businessman has been living in the privately-owned care home in Hull in which council placed him. He says he is kept locked up like a criminal and cannot even go across the road for tobacco and groceries unless accompanied by a carer. His daughter Dawn Walker, , said her father is fully able to care for himself and says she is also supportive of him being released.  David, who ran a building and home insulation business called Save It Insulation, said he owned a five-storey home and an expensive car and was earning lots of money - with up to  employees at his firm - at the height of his success.He said he then ran into dficulties with people owing him money and his we became poorly, and thatHull City Councilaposs social servicesencouraged him to go into respite care for two weeks.That was October . He said has been in the home ever since. Speaking to Hull Live, he spoke of how he had been “incarcerated in [his] room”, where he eats and sleeps, ever since. “Yet I havenapost committed an offence,” he said. “I am appealing it, and I plan to sue for loss of earnings.” I am now on benefits, and I want to be able to go out to work. I canapost actually believe what has happened to me. I thought I was signing details for my next of kin, I feel I have been tricked. The DoLS was without my knowledge. They now have the authority to keep me here. It is one year since I was incarcerated and I am in total limbo. I think they expect me to stay here until I go out in a coffin.”  David said it was a “miscarriage of justice”. He says he has been told an appeal can take up to six months, and he is in the process of consulting with a solicitor. Davidaposs daughter Dawn Walker, , said no-one in the family was consulted about David being shted into the care home, where she believed he was being “treated like a prisoner”. He is intelligent and knowledgeable and shouldnapost be in there. We will do whatever we can to help my dad come out, it has gone on for too long now. He is not confused, he is totally on the ball,” she said. The paperwork for his DoLS, which was initially for a period of seven days, described David as lacking capacity and states there is no mental illness present. The homeaposs manager has written in the paperwork that David canapost feed or dress himself and would be at risk of malnutrition and dehydration. But David and his daughter both dispute this. The records also say he could be suffering from Korsakoff syndrome - a memory disorder caused by a lack of vitamin B, which is easily treatable and reversible. Dawn added: He is more than capable of carrying out daily tasks of looking after himself, washing, shaving, and dressing. His knowledge and understanding is  per cent. A spokesman for Hull City Council said: “We do not comment on ongoing, inidual cases. Deprivation of Liberty Safeguardsensure that people who cannot consent to their care arrangements in a care home or hospital are protected,those arrangements deprive them of their liberty. Arrangements are assessed to check they are necessary and in the person’s best interests. Where a person is objecting to the arrangements for their care and treatment either they and or their representative can make an application to the Court of Protection, under Section A of the Mental Capacity Act. This ensures that the person’s Article  rights, under the Human Rights Act, are protected .” Comment MORE ON David WalkerLibertyHospitalsCare homesHuman rightsNursing homesSocial servicesMiscarriageVitamins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her parents were originally expected toto Britain to have their four-month-old baptised at Windsor Castle like their son Archie, two.But a palace insider has told thethat a UK christening “is not happening”.Instead, Lilibet is likely to be christened into the Episcopal Church of the US, a member church of the worldwide Anglican Communion.  The decision would make a break in tradition and make Lilibet the first of the Queen’s grandchildren or great-grandchildren not to receive a royal baptism within the church of England. It would also mean that it would be unlikely that the Queen, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would attend, according to royal biographer Ingrid Seward.She told The Sun thatLilibet is christening in the United States, “maybe” Harry’s friends would fly out.She added: “I don’t think any members of the immediate Royal Family would have time [to fly over]. Their schedules are organised six months in advance.”  If she is baptised in Calornia, Lilibet would not automatically be considered a member of the Church of England, unless she came to Britain and joined a CofE congregation. Anyone can say they are a member of the Church of Englandthey worship in a CofE church and are not a member of an incompatible religion. It would have no effect on Lilibetaposs standing in the line of succession. Princess Eugenie would be an “obvious” choice for Lilibet’s godmother, as the -year-old has remained close to the Sussexes and recently lent her support to Meghanaposs X Archewell mentorship programme.  Zara or Mike Tindall are also possible godparent choices, Ingrid said, adding that Lilibet would likely have American godparents as Meghan has “obviously got lots and lots of American friends”. Among them, “speculation is re” that Oprah Winfrey could be asked to become Lilibet’s godmother, after hosting the couple’s explosive interview earlier this year. Meghan’s friends Jessica Mulroney, Benita Litt, Jessica’s daughter Ivy and Benita’s daughters Rylan and Remi are also in the running. But the royal expert added she would be “very surprised”the couple chose to hold the christening in the US. She said: “Harry’s great-grandmother is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England - and Meghan was inducted into the Church of England. “If they wanted, Harry and Meghan could have it privately in the Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Queen is not going to say no, she may not be able to be there herself but she’s not going to say they can’t have it there. “The only reason [it wouldnapost be held in the UK] would beMeghan didnapost want to come over here with the baby. That would be the only reason I could think of.”  Either way, the Sussexes are famously particular about their privacy and unlikely to release details about their daughter’s baptism. If they do decide to stay in America, they may not publicly announce the date or details about the ceremony. Ingrid said: “If it happens in the UK obviously people will find out, butit happens [in Calornia], I don’t know that there will be any official announcement. “They’ll have their own Vogue cameraman there, there will definitely be photos but they may not release any.” Comment MORE ON Prince HarryOprah WinfreyRoyal FamilyMeghan MarkleLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair announced the move on their Archewell website and said the roles would help them put their values into action.A statement from the couple said: When we invest in each other we change the world… Be it through the investment of time , investment in community , or the investment of funds , our choices—of how and where we put our energy—define us as a global community.  We believe it’s time for more people to have a seat at the table when decisions are made that impact everyone. We want to rethink the nature of investing to help solve the global issues we all face. Our impact partnership with Ethic is one of the ways we put our values in action. It is believed that the couple were introduced to the fintech asset manager, which has .billion under management, by friends. It is unknown how much they have invested or what they are being paid.In a joint interview with Harry, Meghan told DealBook: “From the world I come from, you don’t talk about investing, right ”  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. “You don’t have the luxury to invest. That sounds so fancy. “My husband has been saying for years, ‘Gosh, don’t you wish there was a place whereyour values were aligned like this, you could put your money to that same sort of thing apos” Meanwhile, Ethic wrote on its website: Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, share a lot of values with us, and we suspect, with many of you as well. That’s why we’re so excited that they’re joining us as impact partners.  They’re deeply committed to helping address the defining issues of our time—such as climate, gender equity, health, racial justice, human rights, and strengthening democracy—and understand that these issues are inherently interconnected. So much so, in fact, that they became investors in Ethic earlier this year and have investments managed by Ethic as well. Now they want to shine a light on how we can all impact the causes that affect our communities, bring transparency into how the corporate world sets the tone and shapes outcomes for everyday families, and believe that more people should have a seat at the table when it comes to making progress.  With their partnership, our shared vision for a world in which all investing is sustainable investing can reach many millions around the globe.Harry and Meghanaposs new project is the latest in a string of business deals theyaposve signed since stepping down as senior royals and leaving the UK to head to Calornia. One is with Netflix, which they will work with to create content that informs but also gives hope. It is unknown exactly how much the deal is worth but it has been reported it could be worth  million.  The couple has also signed a deal with Spoty, said to be worth £million to produce podcasts that promote “erse and inspiring voices” under the coupleaposs brand Archewell Audio. Last year, Meghan enlisted the help of her billionaire chat show friend Oprah Winfrey to help sell a vegan brand of coffee she had invested in. The Duchess backed the firm Clevr Blends – a start-up that makes instant oat-milk lattes – as she reportedly “begins to build a portfolio of startup investments”. However, the value of the deal is unknown. She also wrote a childrenaposs book called The Bench, which was inspired by a poem she wrote for Harry shortly after son Archie was born. It is unknownMeghan received an advance for the book, but a branding expert told MailOnline an advance could have been worth £,. Meanwhile, Harry took a job as the chief impact officer at Silicon Valley start-up BetterUp that focuses on coaching people on their mental health to help peopleaposs performance. His salary has not been revealed but a tech expert revealed it could be around £ million. He is also writing a memoir, although the proceeds from that are going to charity.Comment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Since then, his hair has only got longer and more voluminousCharlie needed to get his first haircut when he was four months old Image: Kennedy News and MediaByHelen Le CaplainChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA mum has said she is regularly stopped in the street by strangers who think her son is a doll or that he is wearing a wig thanks to his wild mop of brunette hair. Emma Mooney, , said nurses and midwives were surprised when her son Charlie Foster was born with black hair. Since then, the nine-month-oldaposs hair has only got longer and more voluminous, Emma said. The mum, who works as a certication manager, said she is stopped every time she leaves the house as other people think her baby is either a le-like reborn doll or that he is wearing a wig. The mum, from Kettering, Northamptonshire, claims she and her son were once stopped by strangers  times in a day. She said: People stop us in the street all the time, itaposs like having a little celebrity. We canapost go through a supermarket shop without people stopping us. Some people in a shop think heaposs a doll and that Iaposm just pushing a doll round in a pushchair. Iaposve been askedhe wears a wig and he gets constantly mistaken for a girl despite dressing him like a boy. When people askheaposs wearing a wig I do think aposwhy do you think that  No-oneaposs putting babies in wigsapos. I used to say he looked like one of the Golden Girls because he had this incredible, enormous head of hair. It looked like heaposd had it blow-dried at the salon. I was in Ikea the other day and someone walked past and she said aposoh my god your babyaposs hair is amazingapos, I get that quite a lot. I donapost mind the attention at all, itaposs lovely. She said: It takes me ages when I go out shopping with him. We went to Asda a couple of days ago. I only needed some bread and some milk and we were there an hour and a half. I think the most Iaposve been stopped in one day is  times with people stopping to ask about it and they want to touch it.The mum-of-one, who lives with -year-old transport planner partner Colin Foster, once shared a charity shop bargain on Facebook modelled by Charlie.The post was flooded with comments from baffled social media users asking Emma whether Charlie was a doll or was wearing a hairpiece. Emma said: In my Facebook post people said they thought he was a doll and askedhe was wearing a wig. Within a few minutes it reached  comments, it was crazy. After posting her Facebook advert, she had to update it to read: Edit: he doesn’t sit in it for long periods, thank you for your advice and yes, I promise he’s a real baby and that’s his real hair! Thank you all SO much for the lovely kind comments about baby Charlie we’re very, very lucky. One Facebook user wrote: He’s lovely, I actually thought at first glance he was a pretty doll! Glad you got him a bargain! Another commented: I thought he was a doll at first and then a real baby wearing a wig and actually itaposs a real baby with his own hair. Just soooo cute. Another user wrote: The kid is nine months old and has better hair than me. Sad times! Great find BTW [by the way].Emma suspected Charlie was going to have a lot of hair when she started experiencing severe heartburn during her pregnancy.She said: I had heartburn when I was expecting him. I had to send Colin out late at night to get me some Gaviscon in the last month. Itaposs completely true, not an old wivesapos tale at all. Iaposm convinced it was Completely true, not an old wivesapos tale, Iaposm convinced it was because he was so hairy.  He was born in January with a full head of hair and all the nurses and midwives all commented about how much hair heaposd got. When I first saw him his hair felt like thick layers of silk. It was amazing, it was the softest thing you could ever possibly imagine touching. Obsessed with Charlieaposs flowing locks, Emma admits she now finds it odd seeing other bald babies. Emma said: When I see another bald baby I just think aposoh my god whereaposs your hair apos, itaposs so weird. Iaposm completely obsessed with his hair. Itaposs more noticeable to me when I see another baby that doesnapost have any hair.  Charlieaposs locks grow at such a rapid rate that Emma had to book him in for his first haircut at the tender age of just four months old. Emma said: He hasnapost lost any hair at all since he was born, itaposs just got bigger and bigger and longer. By the time he was four months old he had to have his first haircut as it was getting into his eyes and you could see it was annoying him. I remember taking him into the salon. I hadnapost got an appointment, the hairdresser just looked at me and said aposwhat would you like doing apos  I said apositaposs not for me itaposs for the babyapos. She took one look at him and her jaw dropped to the floor. She said Charlie needed a second haircut at six months as his fringe was going into his eyes and covering his ears. Emma said she often has to brush Charlieaposs hair and when she washes it with shampoo, she uses a towel to dry it and let the rest dry naturally. The mum said Charlieaposs hair has also caught the attention of companies looking for hirsute tots to model their products. The toddler will experience his first Halloween in just a few weeks and Emma said his luscious locks give her a few options of what to dress him up as. Emma said: Weaposve got a little pumpkin costume for him for Halloween, but I think heaposd make a good draculawe put gel in his hair and swept it all back.

Clare Nadia Childes, , was found dead at home on March  two hours after having a telephone consultation with Dr Gwilym Evans. At an inquest into Mrs Childeaposs death in Caernarfon, Wales, Dr Evans said he was hesitant to refer the mum-of-three to a mental health crisis team because she was intoxicated.Dr Evans - who said he was concerned for Mrs Childeaposs wellbeing at the time - added that with hindsight he would have made an immediate referral, North Wales Live reports.On the day of her death, Mrs Childes had drunk a large bottle of alchol and told her sonaposs girlfriend Llinos Packam - who lived at the same property - she was struggling to cope. Ms Packham advised the mum-of-three to call her GP and Dr Evans responded to her with a callback within  minutes. Dr Evans told the hearing: I had never spoken to Clare before that day but I could hear tension in her voice.She told me she was stressed, felt very unwell and was thinking about killing herself.She numbered problems with her personal le including her drinking, that she was smoking cannabis every day, had financial troubles, had lost her father and had a breakdown in the relationship with her partner. She also said that lockdown had made her feel more unwell.I was concerned for her and told her I would speak to the mental health team and said Iaposd give her a ring tomorrow.She told me she might hang herself later on that evening but I was concerned that the mental health team would decline to see her because she had been drinking so I said I would ring her back as soon as I could. After the conversation, Ms Packham said she tried to comfort the -year-old by telling her to focus on her grandchildren. She left the property after Mrs Childes told her she would not harm herself.Miss Packham said: I reminded her that she had a grandson and a granddaughter on the way and that she should try to concentrate on that.She told me she wasnapost going to do anything and I told her to call meshe needed me.Mc Packham ed home  minutes later and found Mrs Childes hanging and unresponsive. She then called the emergency services who pronounced her dead at the scene. Before her death Mrs Childes had been crying and saying she couldnapost cope and felt she wasnapost fit to be a grandmother, her daughter, Kimberley Childes, said in a statement.She said: She had a history of poor mental health which worsened during lockdown.After Christmas she went downhill.Mam begged the doctor to do something but she was told to wait until the next day.I never imagined she would do something like this.She loved going out and socialising and will be sadly missed by family and friends.At the inquest, Dr Evans said he had taken a suicide prevention training course after hearing of Mrs Childeaposs death. Following the incident, Dr Evans has given presentations on how the mental health reporting system could be improved. He saidhe faced the same situation again, he would make the referral straight away now. At the time I was concerned about the presentation of Clare as she told me she had drank a lot and I was concerned they would not be willing to accept a referralshe was under the influence of alcohol, he added. He didnapost believe her to be in immediate crisis, because she hadnapost indicated she might take her le immediately. Dr Evans also said he wanted to wait until the effects of the alcohol had worn off. The doctor said he called her back at .pm but the call went straight to voicemail. Concluding that Mrs Childes had died as a result of hanging, acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland said she was struggling with financial concerns, her alcohol intake and relationship breakdown. Though a referral was not made to the crisis team, Ms Sutherland said the process of being referred was in Mrs Childeaposs mind at the time of her death. She was then left alone for  minutes before being found at .pm, Ms Sutherland adds. Although she had a supportive family, Mrs Childes was clearly troubled for a long time despite the support around her, Ms Sutherland concluded. The coroner has now requested more evidence to determine whether or not to make a Preventing Future Deaths report.

It is speculated that the tracks, in Barmouth Wales, belong to a long lost railway which has been submerged by sand for decades only appearing due to shting sand patterns First to notice the mysterious tracks was local roofer Dicky Sharp stating he had found the “railway to Cantreaposr Gwaelod - the legendary ancient sunken kingdom of Cardigan Bay.After posting his findings to his Facebook account, many people begun to question the purpose of the railway tracks.Many locals believe that the tracks are actually from the ’s where tracks were laid down so sand and debris could be removed by cart.  Former Snowdonia National Park officer and local Historian Hugh Grfith Roberts debunks this theory, however. Instead he said, the railway tracks pre-dated the sea wall by at least  years and were almost certainly laid in the late th Century for the town’s new sewage system.Since Dicky’s discovery last weekend, a third section of rail track has become visible on the beach at low tide, along with a pair of wheels reports Wales Online.Their re-emergence, after so many years, has also underscored ongoing concerns about the area’s coastal processes and the resulting impact on Barmouth’s infrastructure. The profile of Barmouth beach is under constant threat from high tidal streams and strong currents, with a longshore drt carrying sand northwards.  The West of Wales Shoreline Management Plan notes that Barmouth promenade was built “too far to seaward at its northern end”. According to Mr Roberts, cracks have begun appearing “all along the promenade”. “It’s being undermined by the sand’s disappearance,” he said. Last March a ft hole opened up on the northern promenade following high tides and strong winds. Emergency repairs were carried out after investigations found  sq metres of the prom had collapsed. Inspection of the resulting cavity identied confirmed that  sq metres of the sea defence, promenade and adjacent highway had been undermined.

The pair married in a grand ceremony at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in  with her ied guest list including her grandmother the Queen, supermodel Cara Delevigne and singer Robbie Williams.In fact, more than  people packed into the chapel exactly three years ago to see Eugenie and Jack exchange their vows.Butyou look closely enough at pictures from the day you can see one prime seat at the front of the chapel in front of the Queen was left empty. However, it wasnapost down to a no-show on the big day - it is actually down to the Queen herself. Thataposs because traditionally the Queen and the rest of the royals sit on the right-hand-side of the quire in St Georgeaposs Chapel.Her Majesty is said to prefer to sit in the second row of seats, as, according to The Sun, she finds the front row uncomfortable.

Click here to sign up .And with tradition dictating that no one is allowed to sit in front of the Queen and obstruct her view - this is why the seat was left empty.The same seat was also left empty months earlier when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married in the same chapel. However, there was actually a member of the royal family missing on Eugenieaposs wedding day - the Duchess of Cornwall. Instead, she attended a school harvest festival in Scotland, which she had agreed to make an appearance at before Eugenieaposs wedding date had been confirmed.Since marrying in , Eugenie and Jack have moved into Frogmore Cottage in Windsor and earlier this year welcomed their first child - a son called August Philip. And in a sweet moment in a documentary that aired last month honouring Eugenieaposs late grandfather Prince Philip, she revealed young August got to meet his great-grandfather shortly before his death in April.August was born on February  this year and holding back the tears, Eugenie explained: We named August, August Philip because grandpa has been such a huge, inspiring character in my le. I brought little August to come and meet him and told him that we had named him after him and it was such a lovely moment. We were very lucky to do that. Last month, Eugenie also became an aunt for the first time after her sister Princess Beatrice gave birth to a daughter she named Sienna Elizabeth.

The Queen, , was spotted using the same walking stick back in January , when she used it to assist her walking following a knee operation but has rarely been seen using one. Her Majesty was handed the stick after stepping from her state limousine, and appeared to be moving freely as she walked to her seat for the start of the service.  She used the stick again as she left. It is believed to be the first time she has used a walking aid at a major public event.She did not arrive by the traditional great west door but via the poetaposs yard entrance, a shorter route to her seat.Both developments are understood to be tailored for the Queenaposs comfort.

Click here to sign up.The Royal British Legion has been a leline to the nationaposs armed forces, veterans and the wider military family. The legion is also famous for its poppy appeal, which encourages public donations infor the red flower worn in memory of the UKaposs war dead. Retired Lieutenant General James Bashall, the RBLaposs national president, said the centenary was a very proud moment for all those associated with the legion and it was an honour to have their patron the Queen and Anne as guests at the service. He said: In our centenary year, we remain committed to our mission to ensure that those who have given so much for their country get the fair treatment, support and recognition they deserve. And, as we look ahead to the next century, we invite the next generation to continue our vital work in the years to come. General Sir Nick Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, was among the congregation for the service and the outgoing head of the armed forces was joined by members of the military, veterans and their families from the UK and the Commonwealth. RBL supporters, volunteers and partner organisations were also sat in the pews for the service led by the Dean of Westminster Dr David Hoyle. Readings were given by Colour Sergeant Johnson Beharry, Sir Nick and Sara Jones, whose husband Lieutenant Colonel Herbert H Jones was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery at the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands Conflict. Princess Anne gave a scripture reading on the theme of service, and there was a rededication from the RBLaposs national president, reaffirming the legionaposs commitment to its work. Naomi Hall, an RAF and Afghanistan veteran supported by the RBL as she recovered from physical and mental health injuries, also gave a reading. Ms Hall said: It is a great honour to be asked to help mark the centenary of an organisation that has done so much for me and my military comrades for the last  years, and a privilege to do so in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen. When I was at my lowest ebb, the RBL was there for me and has been ever since. My road to recovery has been a long journey and I could never have imagined it would lead to this day. The RBL was founded on May , , and brought together four national ex-servicemen organisations established to care for military personnel and their families after the First World War. The physical injuries of the ing servicemen were not the only issues that needed addressing. Some men found it dficult to find work, which left their dependants in need. During the following decades the charity has helped members of the armed forces from every major conflict. The past few weeks have been busy for the Queen after she carried out several engagements in Scotland, including attending the opening of the Scottish Parliament on Saturday.It came after her annual summer holiday to Balmoral came to a close and she spoke publicly for the first time about late husband Prince Philip, describing the many happy memories they shared in Scotland.She then travelled back to England and last week started the Queenaposs Baton Relay for the  Commonwealth Games at Buckingham Palace.

Tfany Olszweski decided to take on the daunting DIY challenge with her husband, after the pair received a seemingly hefty quote from a local company.She saved hundreds of pounds on the guest bathroom makeover by taking advantage of deals on eBay, Amazon and BM.Tfany detailed the bathroom revamp with big sales marketplace LovetheSales, sharing her DIY money-saving experience.Tfany, from Aberbargoed in South Wales, told the Liverpool Echo she was “so shocked” when she saw the quote.“There was no way we were going to fork out that amount of money for such a small job, that’s why we decided to do it ourselves,” she said. “It turned out to be a lot of fun and it saved us a lot of money.” The couple had moved into their ex council house two and a half years ago, and Tfany said the downstairs bathroom had quickly turned into a “dumping ground” for shoes, coats and other mess. “I was fed up with it looking so cluttered and I hated that we werenapost utilising the space properly, so it was definitely time for a change,” she said.To get some design ideas, Tfany turned to social media, scouring Pinterest and dferent DIY Facebook groups for inspiration.“Once I knew what direction I wanted to go with in terms of design and decor I had to get all the necessary materials,” she said. We started by painting half of the wall before adding the ling. I found a great deal on paint, £ for a can which I got from BQ. I also got the primer for the same price at Screwfix. I love a good bargain. My favourite find was the wallpaper we got from eBay and Amazon which combined only cost £.. As well as being cheap it was very easy to install. All I had to do was peel and stick. Normally wallpaper installation costs hundreds of pounds, so I’m really happy with the result and the fact that I didn’t have to pay a small fortune was even better. I wanted the flooring to tie in with the wallpaper and that’s when I found the patterned floor pops on Amazon for only £..” Taking on the project helped Tfany realise it was possible to make things look stylish and tasteful without breaking the bank, she said. The decor stuff ended up being the most pricey but they were hardly expensive. I got the light shade for £, the round shelf for £ and the gold mirror for £ all from BM. I managed to get them all on sale. The black mirror I got from Dunelm for £ and the monkey light pull for £ from Argos.

Jacob Hyatt, seven, wants to be able to ride a bike and swing between monkey bars in the park with his friends. Earlier this year he had the opportunity to trial a state-of-the-art ‘superhero arm’ designed by Open Bionics. Jacob’s family are now trying to help him buy a new arm arm in time for Christmas. Mum Bernice, , said: “I have always taught Jacob you don’t have to fit in and that it’s good to be unique and he should be confident. Have your say on this story in the comment section “But there are things he struggles with, so the second he tried on the bionic arm, he was desperate to get one. “Since then, we knew we had to try everything possible to get one for him.The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

She has tried to make le as easy as possible for him by buying clothes with zips not button and Velcro shoes. But as he grows older Jacob is becoming increasingly frustrated by his disability.Bernice put her son’s name forward after spotting a Facebook post about a bionic arm trial.  In August he tested the new £, Open Bionics limb for the first time. Bernice said: “They put sensors on the arm muscles that would control his lower arm, and as soon as they explained how to move the arm, Jacob got it moving straight away. “I nearly cried when he began picking up and dropping tennis balls and doing the ‘OK’ hand sign - his eyes completely lit up.  “I remember him saying ‘mum, look what I can do!’ and I knew we had to get one for him.” The high-tech bionic arm comes with a protective shell decorated to match Jacob’s favourite superhero Iron Man. Mum-of-two Bernice, from Eaton Bray, Bedfordshire, has already received more than £ worth of donations. Her family hope to raise the rest of the money in time for Christmas.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Bernice said: “I was a bit anxious setting up the fundraising page but after seeing how happy that arm made Jacob I had to try everything to make it happen. “The response so far has been amazing - I can’t believe how much money has already been raised.” Anyone wishing to help Jacob should visit the GoFundMe page.

The residents of - Dufouraposs Place, Soho, have not had their leak fixed and have become increasingly concerned about their health.They claim their ceilings have bubbled from the damp and flies have swarmed their flats, My London reports. Sam Taylor has been housed by Westminster City Council for  years and has been experiencing damp in his home since August. Mr Taylor, who is in his seventies, first realised he was experiencing damp six weeks ago in his kitchen and his ceilings and walls have been affected.  Talking to MyLondon, he said: Some days it was like a small river coming down it would last for about an hour.He claimed that, despite efforts to get rid of the damp by mopping and wiping it, the sealant on his bath came off and his walls were bubbling. Mr Taylor says he has also been experiencing a fly infestation and said: I donapost like killing them but they wonapost go out the window.  The issue has been raised with Westminster City Council three times, and a number of plumbers have visited the property but the leak remains unresolved. He said: I just want them to stop the water coming in. Itaposs gone on a bit too long. According to Mr Taylor, this is not the first time something like this has happened in the building. A neighbour, Claude, , also claimed he had been experiencing a similar problem for two months which is coming from above. Since he lives next door to Mr Taylor, they could be affected by the same leak.  Claude said: It’s stripped away all the paint, it’s come through the light fixtures. The place is full of insects and flies because of this. We have a bucket to hold the water coming in through the ceiling. The smell is okay for now because we can keep the windows open. My concern is going to be when it gets colder outside. He continued: There is mould on the walls and I am worried about the respiratory issues that could arise from that. It’s where I cook my food, so now I’m reluctant to prepare or cook food there because of the insects. It’s coming down into the cupboards, which are developing mould, and the rest of the wall. I think pretty soon I’m not going to be able to stay in the apartment.  Claude fears his home is unsafe as the water has leaked into his electrical fixtures and light fittings. He added: You’ll hear popping sounds and the fuse will cut out. If you turn on the light it’ll start crackling. I don’t know how much of the electrical wiring that I can’t see is being affected by water. Claude claims he has been repeatedly reporting the issues to the council, but it remains unsolved despite plumbers attending the property. He added: It’s not clear what the origin of the leak is. Apparently no one can see anything so we’ve been told it must be coming from inside the floor or walls. Westminster City Council has been contacted for comment.

Bobby has spent most of his le locked away in a tiny crate wearing a shock collar to stop him barking - but has since been freed and is now undergoing rehabilitation. The team at the Barn Animal Rescue in Newtownards, Co Down, are getting the loveable Springer-Jack Russell Terrier cross back up to peak condition so he can eventually get a new forever home.His carers are currently working to help him strength his back legs with swimming lessons alongside the team from Vet Rehab NI, reports BelfastLive. And to make sure he is settled in his new surroundings he is allowed to investigate the hydrotherapy suite, including working out who the other dog is in his reflection. Joanne Ford from The Barn said: Little Bobby will sleep well tonight after his first hydrotherapy session at Vet Rehab NI. Bobby is the sweetest, friendliest eight-month-old Springer   Jack Russell Terrier cross who came into us a couple of weeks ago. He has spent his whole le in a tiny crate with a shock collar on.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Due to this he cannot stand properly and his back legs are very weak he spends most of the time crawling on his tummy or dragging his back legs behind him. It was heartbreaking seeing him like this. We decided to help him along and try to make sure he is as fit and healthy as possible for his new home by building up his muscles with hydro. Susan was fantastic and so gentle and caring towards Bobby and really made our first visit very enjoyable. We highly recommend them and will use them again for any of our other dogs that need help.

Jared and Kristi Owens were flying from Texas to Las Vegas at the beginning of the month, but were told by staff at the Southwest Airlines counter at Lubbock airport that the bag on the scale was about two kilograms overweight. Not thinking too much of it, Jared said: Really quickly we are like aposoh, we have got to rearrange some stuffapos. But when they unzipped the bag to see what they could remove, the familyaposs tiny chihuahua named Icky popped her head out of one of Jaredaposs shoes, with the couple having had no idea she was in there when they packed it. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Incredibly, Southwest Airlines staff member Cathy Cook, who was helping the couple at the check in desk when the discovery was made, even offered to look after Icky while they were gone to ensure she remained safe. Jared was blown away by the gesture, saying: They have got a heck of an employee in Cathy. She went above and beyond and never made us feel, you know, they could have turned us in saying we were trying to smuggle a dog to Vegas or something. Never acted like that, they were extremely gracious. Like I said, she was willing to watch our dog for us while we were gone. Jared said the overweight bag check almost certainly saved Ickyaposs le and the pair were thankful they never boarded the plane with the stowaway in tow. But he said that hiding away in small places was not out of character for their lucky pet, adding: She’s the burrower, that’s what she does. She burrows in clothes, she burrows in obviously suitcases now.

Just this year, one unlucky couple claimed to have missed out on no less than £million after their card payment didnapost go through. Previously, unknowing winners have even binned their tickets, while one woman unwisely blew thousands after mistakenly thinking sheaposd scooped the jackpot. Couple miss £m jackpot as card declined Rachel Kennedy, , and Liam McCrohan, , were left “absolutely heartbroken” in March after claiming theyaposd missed out on a £million EuroMillions jackpot. The couple, from Hertfordshire, realised their usual numbers of , , , , ,  and  had come up but there was one major catch - their ticket payment hadnapost gone through. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersThey had played the same numbers for five weeks in a row, before all seven digits appeared in the draw. Rachel explained how she had set up her account to automatically buy a EuroMillions ticket for each draw - but when payment for the winning ticket was attempted, the lottery account did not have enough funds.Checking her account after the draw, she was greeted with a message saying her numbers were a winning match - however, her heart sank when she realised the glitch, The Sun reported. Rachel, a business student at Brighton University, said: I called my boyfriend Liam and my mum into the room and they couldnapost believe it either so I was like, aposoh my god I need to call themapos.  I called the number thinking that I had won £million and they said aposyeah youaposve got the right numbers but you didnapost have the funds in your account for the payment of the ticket so it didnapost actually go throughapos. I was on top of the world when I thought I had won, but when I found out I hadnapost, Liam was actually more upset than me. Rachel said they were absolutely heartbroken - and now thinks of her usual weekly numbers as unlucky and has decided to change them. Camelot, which has operated the UKaposs state-franchised national lottery since its establishment in , has wished Rachel the best of luck in future draws. A company spokesman added: Weaposre aware of Rachelaposs story and hope she gets in early to buy a ticket for the next big draw. Marriage breaks down after losing £m ticket It took Martyn and Kay Tott six months to realise they had won over £million on the National Lottery back in . The massive realisation finally dawned on the Totts, from Watford, after they spotted an appeal for the winner to come forward.  There was, however, one big problem – they had lost the winning ticket. Dubbed ‘the unluckiest couple in Britain’, Martyn and Kay were able to prove via computer records they were telling the truth and the case soon gained national attention.Sir Richard Branson and even Tony Blair spoke out in support, but, without the actual winning ticket, they were unable to collect a single penny of their fortune.Sadly, the coupleaposs marriage later broke down, but Martyn eventually explained he was glad he didnapost win.Having that money taken away was torture, he told the Mail on Sunday.  For a long time I lost sight of who I was and what I believed in. But I can honestly say I’m glad I didn’t get the £million now. There is no guarantee it would have brought me happiness. Pals furious after binning m ticket Two friends in America threw a million-winning US Powerball ticket in the trash. Salvatore Cambria and Erik Onyango of New York later tried to sue the Lottery Commission of New Jersey, the neighbouring state where they regularly went to buy their tickets.  The pair decided to throw the ticket out after checking the winning numbers on the New Jersey lottery website in . Unfortunately, they were checking their numbers against the wrong results as the website had not yet been updated. It wasn’t until the following day the pair realised they had actually won, by which time, as their lawyer put it, “their money was headed to a garbage dump somewhere in Canada. Woman goes on shopping spree thinking sheaposs won Itaposs one thing realising youaposve just missed out on the big prize - and another mistakenly assuming youaposve won. Back in , a delighted lottery player in France reportedly splurged thousands of Euros on clothes, jewellery and perfumes after believing sheaposd scooped a huge EuroMillions jackpot.The woman - whose identity was not disclosed - wrote out cheques for her expensive purchases, believing she would be covered by her winnings, according to Lottery.Unfortunately, after splashing out more than €,, her husband pointed out that one of the digits didnapost match those in the draw. In an attempt to avoid criminal proceedings, the woman tried to claim her handbag had been stolen and that she hadnapost written the cheques at all - but was foiled by CCTV footage. She was hauled before a French court, which gave her a four month suspended sentence as well as community service and an order to repay her debts in instalments Plumber left m ticket behind pipe Staten Island plumber Anthony Perosi left a winning lottery ticket stashed behind a basement pipe for six weeks before realising he had won million. Anthony had all but forgotten about it until word spread that an unclaimed winning ticket had been traced back to the same store where he made his purchase in . Suddenly remembering, he headed to the basement where he found the ticket pinned behind a pipe. It was only then that he realised he was in fact the lucky winner.  “I tried to breathe in and nothing would go in,” he told the New York Times.“I thought I was having a heart attack and my heart stopped. So I grabbed the ticket, figuring they would find it in my hand.” Fortunately, Anthony was able to claim the prize and decided to split the winnings - with his son.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON EuromillionsNational Lottery\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was so embarrassed. My own mum didnapost even show, she wrote in the caption, before adding: Had a baby shower today just to wait there looking stupid, and end up having nobody show.

This is where you move away and forget to tell them, one TikTok user suggested. Find somewhere with love and support. Blood doesnapost equal love all of the time. Another added: Just remember your baby loves you more than anyone  ever could. Honour that baby by doing better for your baby than your mum did for you. Thataposs what Iaposm doing for my daughter. Unfortunately not everyone was quite so supportive, with several TikTokers suggesting Annieaposs story didnapost quite add up. So a family member planned this, invited people and literally not one person showed up  Definitely not doubting your story, just seems bizarre, one wrote. Annie replied: That is why I was so surprised and disappointed, I invited a good amount of people and nobody showed.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A report released in Australia this week points out the dangers posed by Covid- in the long term and says the pandemic will not end for anyone until it ends for everyone. According to the document, a survey of  epidemiologists from  countries found that two thirds believe Covid could mutate within a yearauthorities do not act fast enough.The report, published on Monday as New South Wales lted its coronavirus restrictions, says low-income countries will not manage to vaccinate  per cent of their populations until after not helped by richer nations. Experts have called on the Australian government to promise to share another  million vaccines and invest an extra  millionin Covid- Vaccines Global Access . The report says: Speed is of the essence. If we vaccinate the world faster, the likelihood of mutations drops. It is within our power to limit the chance of the next mutation from being so deadly and disruptive. Reverend Tim Costello, a spokesman for the campaign group End Covid For All, said there is a risk of more iants emerging due to a large gap in vaccination rates around the world.  He said: The Delta strain, and the havoc it has wreaked across Australia, shows we cannot allow Covid to run rampant and mutate overseas. The last thing we want, on freedom day in NSW, is the prospect of further deaths and lockdowns because we didn’t do all that we could to vaccinate the world. First, because that is morally wrong. But also because, sooner or later, the consequences will be felt here. That is why we must play a leading role in aggressively responding to this pandemic on a global scale.  It comes as several countries, including the United States, Israel and UK, have begun offering Covid- vaccine booster shots. The UKaposs Health Secretary urged people to get their flu jab and Covid- booster shot to give themselves and their loves ones the best possible protection in the months ahead. Sajid Javid said he had done his bit after having his flu vaccination at a pharmacy in central London.Mr Javid said: Alongside the Covid- booster jabs, we are rolling out the biggest flu programme in our history, with a record  million people in England eligible for a free flu jab to keep them safe this winter. Iaposve done my bit by getting my flu vaccine, and itaposs vital that all those who are eligible come forward for both their flu and Covid- booster vaccines, to give themselves and their loved ones the best possible protection in the months ahead. The Government has launched the biggest flu programme in the NHSaposs history, with more than  million people in England eligible for a free vaccination.

To join, all you need to do is answer a few brief questions and our Europe Talks algorithm will do the rest. You’ll be matched with someone who thinks dferently about the world as well as being from another European country. You then arrange your own meet-up by video call – andyou want to, you can tell us how you got on. Last year, as the UK reached the end of the EU transition period, we reached out to our nearest neighbours to pair , people across Europe, including , from the UK. This year, the number of media partners taking part in the project has doubled to .To join, see mirror europetalks To kickstart Europe Talks , we tracked down two of the people who made the most powerful contribution to ET – frontline doctors Roberto Cosentini, an ICU director from Lombardy, Italy, and London junior doctor Shaan Sahota. When they met over Zoom a year ago, they bonded instantly over their traumatic experiences of treating ICU Covid patients. “It was such a privilege,” says Shaan, . “To hear this man that I have no connection with but who has this parallel experience, to hear what got it him through and how hard he’d found it, was very powerful.”  Speaking between shts at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, in Bergamo, northern Italy, Roberto, , explained how Europe Talks had helped him. He said: “Sharing experience is something that belongs to our job and makes us feel useful not only for patients but also for our colleagues, it’s fundamental. “Even though we knew almost nothing about the disease, we treated patients. “People felt they were being cared for.”  A year on, and things are still busy but less fraught for both medics. After caring for Covid patients through the UK’s second and third waves of the pandemic, Shaan, of Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, North West London, is about to start studying for a tropical medicine diploma, allowing her to work as an international volunteer. She wrote a play that drew on her experience of looking after Covid patients, Under the Mask, which was performed earlier this year in London. She remembers finding Roberto’s words inspirational. Shaan said: “It was important for me to hear how overwhelming it was for someone of that level of expertise in the emergency department. How he felt having this sense of responsibility, ‘We have to teach the world what we’re learning’ but also just his recounting on a personal level of what they did to keep morale up. “I had not heard that, the idea they thanked each other, that was really moving.”  Over in Bergamo, things are quieter, with a couple rather than hundreds of admissions a day. Still, Roberto thinks Italy is entering a fourth wave of the pandemic. Like Shaan, he managed to take a break over summer and spend time with the family he had been separated from. And both medics say they are finally feeling more optimistic about the future of public health. Speaking from Bangkok where she is visiting her actor partner, Shaan says: “I went back in for the terrible wave we had in January. That was quite intense. “We had more treatment, it was all geared up faster, it was less upsetting and confusing. “But it was hard, a lot of people died, and everyone was running on empty. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.“The vaccine has really transformed things. Even though numbers were going up in June and July, it wasn’t translating into as many people being really sick. It feels like the world is coming back.” Getting ready to head back to the ward, Roberto adds: “I think it will fade away, at least in Italy, where we’re going to vaccinate even more people. “Unless there will be some new, strong and virulent strain that will become resistant to vaccination, Covid will fade away within one year.” We also checked in on our two youngest participants from last year – British schoolgirl Rachael Chun, , and Spanish counterpart Sara Martinez Quevedo, . They discovered a shared love of books and frustration at being trapped in their tower-block homes in lockdown. Rachael, from Birmingham, says: “Things are better now – it’s much more like before. We went camping to Somerset in the summer.  “Meeting Sara was a really good experience. We live in dferent places but a lot of the things that were happening to me were happening to her too. I’m glad she’s doing OK.” For Sara, who lives in Madrid, the last year has been about ing to “normal”. After some localised lockdowns at Christmas, she’s been able to play outside with friends. During the summer Spaniards were able to travel again so she enjoyed time away with her family in France and Portugal, and other parts of Spain. Now she is booked in to be vaccinated in January and smiles as she looks back on her chat with Rachael. Sara said: “We shared experiences and I really liked knowing how things were going somewhere , in England. I liked meeting her and talking. It was very nice just to meet new people, especially someone in a dferent country.

Reaching out to a European stranger might sound daunting but the overwhelming feedback from participants was that people who signed up for Europe Talks had their courage rewarded many times over.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

who had just announced Stephen Hatfield as their new manager - forced three corners in the opening stages as they aimed to make an instant impression for their new boss.But Gala weathered the initial storm and with just four minutes on the clock Calum Hall cut in from the left and drilled a -yard pile-driver into the bottom corner of the net.After that, the visitors totally dictated the play, pinning Gretna back deep into their own half with skipper Jack Beaumont spraying passes across the park as Gala probed and pressed for the breakthrough.And it came on the ninth minute mark when Ciaren Chalmers burst through the home defence and his shot squeezed over the line.The dominance continued and a third goal arrived in the rd minute when Zander Murray spectacularly erted a Beaumont delivery into the roof of the net with a volley.After the interval Gretna retreated into their own half to try and keep the score down and the plan worked.Although Gala should have scored a fourth on the hour mark when they were awarded a penalty for handball.Daryl Healys spot kick lacked power and the Gretna keeper pulled off a fine save.Gala continued to dominate but Gretna were dangerous on the break and almost pulled one back when a shot struck the inside of the post but bounced back along the line.And Gala had keeper Dean Beveridge to thank for a brilliant slide tackle to foil a Gretna forward who had evaded the offside trap.However, the visitors were coasting to victory with Gregor Jordan and Lewis Hall outstanding at the back with the game outcome out of sight.Unfortunately, a stramash in the Gala goalmouth in injury time as a corner was about to be delivered ended the game on an ugly note.The result was four yellow cards - two for each team - with one of them to Gala right back Sean Docherty, currently on loan from Hearts, but as he had been booked earlier he ultimately received a red card which was a disappointing end to the game.With five wins in a row, Gala now have a huge Lowland League encounter against Civil Service Strollers at Netherdale on SaturdayThe Edinburgh side are the surprise packets of the Lowland League this season and are currently deservedly fourth in the table with another midweek win against Caledonian Braves.

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate. The new proposals will still represent a signicant investment in Tweedbank and the Scottish Borders and will bring jobs to the local area. Irsquom sure everyone will welcome the new investment and will look pragmatically at the new proposals in light of the current economic backdrop.Premier InnA spokesperson told us: ldquoThe contract we agreed with our development partner has now expired and having re-appraised the proposed -bedroom hotel in the current economic climate, it is currently unviable for [owner] Whitbread.

This week, reporter Hilary Scott speaks to two men who, for several years, have helped people in the Borders...Itrsquos hard to believe that the Peeblesshire Foodbank has been running for almost a decade.When Francis Mordaunt and James Adams decided to join the small team of volunteers, they all thought the foodbank would be short-lived, a stop-gap while the economy recovered from the financial collapse.But the desperate crisis of people going hungry continued to rise, and the impact of the pandemic was felt most deeply by poorer households.Former manager Francis, and team leader James, have now retired from their roles.This week, they told me how the foodbank went from operating from a garage with a few referrals, to becoming a registered charity with premises in Cavalry Park, feeding hundreds of people across the county.The foodbank was formed in  following a meeting held at St.Peters Episcopal Church, initiated by the Rector Rev Jim Benton-Evans.Rev Jim was chairman, Katie Buckingham was secretary, and the manager was Gillian Hughes. The board of governors included several clergy, a headteacher, a local councillor and several others, who decided to operated under the auspices of The Trussell Trust, who were involved in many other foodbanks in the UK.Francis retired to Peebles that year and joined the congregation of St Peterrsquos.ldquoHaving told Rev Jim that I was interested in becoming involved in the community, he invited me to become a volunteer, he said.ldquoMany years earlier, while living in Edinburgh, I had helped at the Old St.Pauls Ritz Cafeacute that provided breakfasts during the week to the homeless men and women in the Grassmarket and central Edinburgh. So volunteering at the foodbank in Peebles appealed to me as it was another opportunity to help those who for whatever reason were going hungry.Initially, Francisrsquos voluntary role was packing food parcels at the Bakehouse Hall and delivering them.ldquoIn those early days, the food was stored in Enid Clariersquos garage in March Street Lane, he said.In Autumn , local MP David Mundell officially opened the Peeblesshire Foodbank, and Francis was appointed treasurer.Francis said: ldquoI inherited a positive bank balance from the initial fundraising efforts before I became a volunteer. Unfortunately, our costs were almost non-existent, so there was little to do the first purchase I remember was a set of scales as the Trussell Trust required us to weigh all food donations in and out and record them on a central database.The foodbank soon moved to more permanent premises in Cavalry Park with storage space for food donations.Francis added: ldquoWe now had a modest rent to pay, insurance costs and a mobile phone but few other costs. The Trussell Trust required us to become a charity, and Rev Jim asked me to complete the application to the Scottish Charity Commission.The Peeblesshire Foodbank became a registered charity in January , and two years later, Rev Jim handed over the reins of the foodbank.Before departing, he set up a management structure to ensure the foodbank continued to run smoothly.Francis, who was appointed as manager, worked with team leader James Adams.Rev Callum MacDougall was the chairman until his retirement in , when Father Tony Lappin took up the position.ldquoOnce the pandemic hit the premises at Cavalry Park became hopelessly small, and Father Tony arranged for the foodbank to move temporarily to St Josephrsquos Hall, explained Francis.ldquoSo one of my last actions for the foodbank before retiring was to arrange the rental of the new much bigger premises in Cavalry Park where the Peeblesshire foodbank is now located.Since its inception, the number of people reaching out to the foodbank for help has grown rapidly.ldquoIn the early years, we had up to two referrals a week, about  a year with an average of two people fed per referral. That meant we were feeding about  people a year, said Francis. ldquoBy , that had increased to nearly  people a year, and by  it was over .Francis said the role made him quite emotional at times: ldquoIn several cases, the recipients burst into tears on receiving their food parcels delivered to their doors. It meant a lot to me to see the gratitude as the foodbank was meeting an urgent need.Jamesrsquos involvement in the foodbank echoed Francisrsquos, as he retired to Peebles from Belfast in  and joined St Peterrsquos Church.He said: ldquoMy we and I were anxious to get involved with the community and make friends, and to help with a foodbank seemed a worthwhile opportunity.Recalling the old days when they used a garage to store food, James said: ldquoIt had no heat or light and littleany shelving, but it was a base. Donations were mainly from Tesco collections.ldquoThere was a book recording parcels issued, and my memory was that perhaps only four or five were issued in an average week, and there was a description of the call and the circumstances. I donrsquot think the availability of the Foodbank was well publicised at that time.However, he says there was a dficult period when he and Francis struggled to keep up with demand.ldquoWe ended up covering  days at a time, which was not sustainable. We were, on average, delivering around eight parcels per week at that time.Appeals for help brought in big-hearted community volunteers.James said: ldquoWe were able to move to a four-week rota, and Billtook responsibility for uplting donations and collecting empty boxes. In addition, positive steps were taken to advertise the foodbank and increase usage, and leaders met at intervals to discuss all aspects of the foodbank. This was, I believe when things began to move forward.Although the charity had an army of volunteers, financial constraints were a concern.ldquoIn the beginning, money was scarce, and there was always a worrywe could continue to afford the premises when we moved to Caly Park, said James.However, both have paid tribute to ldquosuper fundraiser, Nancy Fenton.James added: ldquoNancy held a coffee morning and progressed from that to raising money by selling a wide iety of items online. The work she put in was phenomenal, as was the cash raised, but these efforts raised the profile of the foodbank as well. Her efforts gave us a very secure financial base which has provided some security as the Foodbank progresses.In addition, local churches, businesses, charities and iniduals raised funds for the foodbank, usually on their own initiative.And iniduals have been making financial donations directly to the bank account via the website.Francis added: ldquoDonations of food, particularly through the local supermarket collection points, always continued at a high level, and shortages were only ever confined to a relatively few inidual items. The generosity of the Peeblesshire community has been incredible.Reflecting on his days delivering food parcels to those in need, James said: ldquoThere were people, mainly those living alone, who I delivered to more than a few times. I rightly or wrongly felt that they found it dficult simply to cope with le in general, and the foodbank was essential to simply feed themselves.Ultimately, COVID and age marked the end of Francis and Jamesrsquos incredible journey with the Peeblesshire Foodbank.The Trussell Trust stood down everyone over the age of  years.During the pandemic, one thing thatrsquos brightened our lives has been the stories of the everyday heroes doing their bit to support people through these dficult days.Together, these two selfless gentlemen worked tirelessly for several years making sure struggling families had a meal to put on the table.They are the retiring heroes behind Peeblesshire Foodbank, who helped countless people."},{"url":null,"title":"former-jed-forest-star-completes-ninth-charity-marathon","story":"FORMER Jed-Forest star Chris Laidlaw is now three quarters of the way through his lsquo in  marathon challengersquo.Laidlaw, who hails from Jedburgh has been running a marathon each month this year to raise funds for three charities which mean a lot to him - the Murrayfield Injured Players Foundation Marie Curie and Alzheimerrsquos Scotland.His first marathon took place on New Yearrsquos Day on a -mile course near Edinburgh and since then he has run another eight.This was ato happy territory for him as he set out from Fisherrow Harbour in Musselburgh and finished at Hallhill, home ground for Dunbar Rugby Club, where he spent three years as Development Officer.He said: ldquoThe marathons donrsquot get any easier.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

When they called me for a pre-programme chat, I was asked how my age affected my parenting. I was askedI had less energy as an older parent and got very tired. My response was that every parent, no matter the age, gets very tired!I agreed to do the show. Their intentions were good and I was treated very fairly, and I think the host was sympathetic and supportive. Irsquom not the oldest parent in the land, but I do concede that Irsquom older than most, at least in terms of my younger children, the youngest of whom is six.But the experience raised some interesting questions for me about how age is often used to define us and our abilities, and indeed how we can define ourselves by it.Thankfully, these days society is far more erse and also, I believe, less judgmental, of people who donrsquot conform to stereotyped roles. But the truth is, recently I have begun to feel the cold wind of ageism affecting how I see myself and my opportunities.This radio programme was just the most recent example of my age being regarded an issue. Of course, as we age we do change in our abilities, nobody could deny that. But that can be for the better as well. Being seen as older is relative to the context, I get that. As a dad of young children, I accept the label of older parent. But it was the assumptions about how my age must negatively affect my capabilities as a dad which hit me hard.I felt uncomfortable even acknowledging these feelings to myself. Then I realised that was part of the problem: that people who are older can feel they have no entitlement to speak out against the unfair judgements they feel are attached to their age. Societyrsquos message can be brutal: as people get older, they need to give way and quietly fade .Irsquom nearly , not very old really, but certainly getting on. This is not about denying my age. I would not want to pretend to be younger. I am who I am. Actually, Irsquom quite proud to have made it this far and hope to have a couple more productive decades, at least,my luck holds out.But I fear that so far Irsquove only had a taster of what is to come with assumptions about my age. It seems to begin in earnest when someone reaches their s.Finding work after the impact of the lockdowns is a massive challenge, and huge source of anxiety, for millions of people. Those who are older, I suspect, will find their age a source of subtle discrimination, regardless of their actual abilities and family responsibilities.And the key word here is lsquosubtlersquo. Few employers will say out loud that they think someone is too old for a job, eventhey have the abilities to do it well. There is anti-discriminatory legislation in place now to prevent that. So itrsquos unspoken and structural ndash the discrimination is so ingrained that most of us donrsquot see it or realise discrimination is taking place. Its most powerful effect is the internalisation of it by older people themselves, who donrsquot even apply for jobs they know they are fully qualied and able to do, because of the fear they will be seen as ldquotoo old.I myself have only come to understand this as I have grown older and experienced it personally. I was once young, of course, as all older people were, and I was as guilty as anyone  of judging older people because of their age when I had youth on my side. So I speak from no moral high ground and some may say itrsquos just the way of things.Thatrsquos the pernicious nature of this kind of discrimination: it can be seen as a sad but inevitable rite of passage part of the circle of le in which we will inevitably be marginalised by society in a host of dferent ways as we get older.But I donrsquot believe it need be this way, and part of changing it is talking honestly about it, and calling it out when it happens. Age is just one part of who we are. It doesnrsquot completely define us or our abilities, capabilities or suitability for a job or le responsibility. And let us not forget that age discrimination doesnrsquot only affect older folk. Young people, including teenagers, can suffer from it too from older people.There are cultures which revere the contribution and abilities of older people, rather than dismiss or diminish them letrsquos try and make our society one of them. I donrsquot say this for me, but for everyone out there who is experiencing that gradual push into the margins they feel they just have to accept, regardless of what they can actually do.Itrsquos about inter-generational respect and it has to go both ways to be effective. In a sense, we would all be winners with this change, as we all learn,we are lucky enough to become older, that time truly does fly."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraiser-raises-700-walk-scott-foundation","story":"Iain Donaldson-Elder, , a former Musselburgh Grammar School pupil, participated in this yearrsquos recent Walk with Scott.Walkers covered  miles across East Lothian and Iain joined at Haddington as they made their way to the town rugby club after following the Longniddry to Haddington railway walk.Accompanied by Jim Liddle, from Leuchie House, a respite centre near North Berwick for people with MS and other long-term conditions, Iain ldquorolled his wheelchair for about three miles and was delighted to receive a certicate as a Scotter of the Year from Councillor Colin McGinn.Iain told the Courier: ldquoThe walk itself was wonderful, emotional and, although short, very rewarding as I got to meet people that I had only known through Facebook.

In his pocket is an excoriating acceptance speech, with which he intends to settle a few scores at the televised ceremony. But before he even gets there, he gashes his hand, his son is arrested and he assaults a member of the public. Simons has created a memorable character in the brash but sensitive author, interspersing the setbacks of his big day with flashbacks revealing the wounds he carries around and those hersquos inflicted on others. In an irony lost on no-one, least of all himself, the theme of Jakersquos shortlisted novel is the responsibilities we have to those who love us. Simons skilfully handles the delicate balancing act of romping through the comical mishaps of Jakersquos whisky and codeine-fuelled day while eliciting sympathy for his well-realised protagonist.THE PURPOSE OF POWERAlicia GarzaPenguin, pound.One of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter, Alicia Garza grew up in Northern Calornia, watched the  LA riots on TV and writes here about her inspirations and the path that led to the creation of BLM. More importantly, she draws on her -plus years of experience as an activist to examine the steps needed to create a sustainable movement which can progress from protesting to acquiring political power and bringing about social change. Social media is no substitute for solid organisation and community involvement, she insists, while discussing how to negotiate the pitfalls of activism, such as internal power struggles, the lack of women in leadership positions and people who are reluctant to act in their own interest. With racial and generational discontent growing on a global scale, the wisdom and advice in this book will assist progressive movements of all kinds tomore effectively.WELCOME TO COOPERTariq AshkananiThomas  Mercer, pound.After ratting out his drug-dealing partner, Detective Thomas Levine has been transferred from Washington DC to the nowheresville of Cooper, Nebraska ndash where, on his first day, a woman is found dead with her eyes gouged out.

The real killer is still out there somewhere, but Levine now has to contend with his own colleagues and a ruthless drug cartel too. Ominous and compelling from the start, this debut novel from an Edinburgh solicitor nails the blunt, noirish prose of the hard-boiled thriller.

We are committed to ensuring our people who keep our communities connected are properly rewarded, particularly after their contribution to the country over the past  months of the pandemic.“We have worked tirelessly to protect the jobs of our people during the pandemic and done everything we reasonably can to hold constructive discussions with Unite to reach a sensible and sustainable pay agreement across our bus depots.“We are leaving no stone unturned in a bid to reach a settlement. That is why we are putting a fresh pay offer to Unite in talks scheduled to take place next week.”According to Stagecoach, bus services are facing a continuing challenging financial environment with passenger levels signicantly down on pre-COVID levels. Passenger fares are signicantly short of what is needed to cover the day-to-day costs of running services without Scottish Government support.Mr Beaton added: “We would urge Unite to end the uncertainty for our people and the customers who rely on bus services.“Strike action is completely unnecessary and would simply damage the lives and livelihoods of hard-working people, including our employees, as well as the region’s businesses.#We would urge Unite to put communities first and talk, not walk.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But the fourth industrial revolution, the rise of China and environmental, economic and geo-political events have outpaced global economic governance.ldquoEconomic resilience is delivered by ersication, co-dependence and public-private partnerships within well-governed, open and integrated global markets.ldquoThe lsquoCornwall consensusrsquo reflects that insight and recommends investment, standards and inclusive governance to meet the challenges and opportunities of the mid-st century.The report says climate change, bioersity loss and the next health crisis are poised to destabilise domestic and global economies.It adds: ldquoPreparing for the next crisis requires a fundamentally dferent approach to economic policy and international collaboration.

It says the extension of Covid support schemes, such as the eviction ban, helped prevent such an increase but it adds that now some support schemes are winding down there is a fresh concern.The report says that every , new social rent homes built delivers the equivalent of pound. billion to the public finances over  years, which includes savings in housing-related benefits, tax receipts from the construction industry, and the wider impacts of getting people into higher quality and more energy efficient housing.The LGA is also calling for the Government to reform Right to Buy and allow councils to retain % of receipts.LGA spokesperson Councillor David Renard said: ldquoWe are concerned that as le s to normal there could be an increase in homelessness cases in the coming months.ldquoWe want to work with government on a cross-departmental long-term homelessness prevention strategy and tackle our housing shortage as we recover from the pandemic.ldquoGiving councils the powers and resources to build , social homes for rent each year, including further reform to Right to Buy, would not only help to reduce homelessness but deliver a third of the Governmentrsquos housing target.Mr Renard added: ldquoThere is a desperate need to build more social housing in this country, which should be a central part of the Governmentrsquos ambition to level-up and build back better following the pandemic. Social housing gives families the security and stability of a decent home, as well as being a route to owning your own home through Right to Buy.ldquoNow is the time to reverse the decline in council housing over the past few decades. The benefits are clear ndash a programme of , social homes a year would shorten council housing waiting lists, reduce homelessness and cut carbon emissions, while delivering a multi-billion long-term boost to the economy.Labourrsquos shadow housing secretary Lucy Powell described the Conservativesrsquo record on social housing as ldquowoeful.She said Labour would give local authorities powers to buy and develop land for housing to ldquoempower communities.A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: ldquoWe are building more social housing and taking action to reduce waiting lists, which have fallen by almost , households since .ldquoWersquove delivered over , affordable homes for rent, including , for social rent. But we must go further, so wersquore investing over pound billion in affordable housing over the next five years ndash the largest investment in affordable housing in a decade.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We canrsquot sit back and watch whole British industries go to the wall.The former Labour leader, who was at the troubled Copenhagen UN climate summit in  as UK climate change secretary, will say the Government has not properly set out what Cop in Glasgow should achieve ndash and is undermining its own case as it tries to call for action.At Cop, countries will be under pressure to increase ambition and action to meet the goals of the Paris accord to keep global temperature rises to well below C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to keep them to .C ndash beyond which the worst impacts of the climate crisis will be felt.In his speech, Mr Miliband will warn that to meet the C target, we need to cut emissions by  billion tonnes a year in  and  billion tonnes for achieving the .C goal.But on the basis of pledges made there will only bea maximum reduction of four billion tonnes of greenhouse gases by , he will warn.ldquoThis is the undeniable and frightening maths of Glasgow, he will tell the event hosted by the think tank Green Alliance.ldquoWe cannot let Cop be the greenwash summit.ldquoItrsquos time for the Prime Minister to get off his sun lounger, be a statesman and make Glasgow the success we need it to be. This summit must succeed.ldquoIt still can. But we need a step-change in action from our government and governments across the world.And he will warn: ldquoAbove all, finally, at the th hour, the Prime Minister must treat this summit with the seriousness which it deserves.He will also criticise the Government for cutting its aid budget at a time when trust between developing and developed countries is key and the UK needs to persuade others to step up to deliver climate finance for poor countries.Mr Miliband will point to a trade deal with Australia, which does not include Paris temperature commitments, and the potential new coal mine in Cumbria just as the UK, as Cop hosts, is pushing for an end to coal.ldquoThe Government have been at best bystanders and at worst, contributors to global inaction, he will argue.His comments come after Cop President Alok Sharma urged major economies to come forward with new climate action plans for  to keep the .C goal within reach.Mr Sharma has said the Glasgow summit must have a negotiated outcome which drives increased ambition up to , countries must take action on coal, protecting forests, clean transport and methane emissions, and deliver a long-promised  billion US dollars a year in finance for poorer countries.A Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Prime Minister has made tackling climate change his personal international priority and has been focusing his efforts on ensuring that world leaders can come together and deliver for our planet in Glasgow.ldquoHe has been clear that Cop must be the moment that every country, and every part of society, embraces their responsibility to protect our shared future and is looking forward to meeting with leaders ndash from big emitters to climate vulnerable nations ndash to make sure Cop counts.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633967490726.jpg--covid_19___mon_11th_october_figures.jpg?1633967490000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211011newscovid 19 mon 11th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows Five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

The building was the home of UTV from  until , when the broadcaster relocated to City Quays.

Credit: Simon Graham Harrison PhotographyRead MoreSave Havelock House group wants it listed for th anniversary Developer of old UTV Havelock House HQ fights refusal by plannersThe plans attracted dozens of objections, many due to the cultural and historical importance of the site, and the size of the proposed building – eight storeys. Belfast City Council planners recommended the application for approval, but it was rejected by members of City Hall#s Planning Committee.Locka Ltd appealed the decision however this was recently dismissed by the Planning Appeals Commissioners.The council raised several concerns over the application, firstly relating to the height, scale and design of the proposed building.They argued it would have an overly-dominant impact on the Grade B listed Klondyke Building to the east, and the Grade B+ listed Rose Cottage in Walnut Court to the north west.The planning commissioner said: In my opinion the height and massing of the proposal would be inappropriate, seen in juxtaposition with the Klondyke building the detailed design does not respect the setting of the listed building in terms of scale, height, or massing and this conflicts with [council planning policy]. I judge that the council’s first reason for refusal is sustained.Another council concern was that the proposed building would not fit with its surrounding context and would have an overly-dominant impact when viewed from Ormeau Road and the residential streets to the west and north west, unacceptably harming the character and appearance of the area”.The planning commissioner ruled that the proposed development fails to respect the surrounding context and said this conflicts with sections of the council#s planning policy.I judge that the council’s second reason for refusal is sustained. I acknowledge that the design of the proposed building was deemed acceptable by the council’s planning officers during [pre-application discussion] however, the council itself decided to refuse the planning application for the reasons stated in the decision notice it is this refusal that I have considered, the commissioner#s ruling said.Campaign group Donegall Pass Community Forum welcomed the decision to dismiss the appeal.This outcome may be seen as the beginning of positive change for the community. The community is very appreciative of the result. They view this as an opportunity for the developer to engage with the communitythey are willing, the group said in a statement.Only through engagement can a design solution for the site, which benefits the majority of interests for all parties, be achieved. Donegall Pass Community Forum would welcome such a conciliatory move from the developer as a step to improve relations with the community.This encouraging decision focuses the need to change current legislation to embed communities’ views within the planning process. Belfast City Council is not legally required to undertake community engagement.This is seen as a discretionary decision by its Planning Department. Existing planning law offers only a tokenistic nod to the community’s views, particularly in large-scale developments which affect whole neighbourhoods. Current legislation is outdated allowing developers to force through poorly thought out design solutions.This reinforces ision and exclusion within communities exacerbating their further decline.”Olympian Homes has been contacted for comment.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City Council PremiumAlmost half of Belfast businesses don’t believe prospects will improve in coming months – survey PremiumPest control costs in NI have risen by % in the last five years PremiumMarathon organisers face criticism after single-use plastic bottles left on east Belfast streetTeenage boy held at knepoint during south Belfast robberyNI council axes £k spend on diaries and Christmas cardsMost ReadNigel Farage: I was hoaxed into ‘Up the Ra’ birthday greetingBelfast restaurant Top Blade slammed for posting image of woman’s underwear on social media jobs to go as Co Down firm goes into liquidationFormer UTV studios on Belfast’s Ormeau Road saved from demolitionGarfield Beattie: From UVF Glenanne murder gang member to painter of republican iconsTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Emergency services attend incident at house in GulladuffPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVF \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news caa .ece AUTOCROP wh ddebddbacffefd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news caa .ece AUTOCROP wh ddebddbacffefd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police attend the scene of a car crash in west BelfastLatest Belfast BeatAlmost half of Belfast businesses don’t believe prospects will improve in coming months – surveySinn Fein JJ Magee’s fish supper dinner makes appearance during Belfast council universal credit debateKicking down road ‘laughable,’ says Sinn Fein as bonfire motion fails: PUP councillor blasts attempt to ‘undermine unionist culture’City Quays Gardens: Vibrant urban project to take root along Belfast’s waterfrontFirm linked to ex-KFC tycoon Michael Herbert given the green light to transform Belfast church hall into apartmentsLatestHenrietta Lacks’ memory honoured by special WHO awardWhat the papers say – October Daughter of s Stonehenge custodian shares her memories of historic siteIan Baraclough bemoans ‘ragged’ display and tells side to give Northern Ireland fans something to cheer after Bulgaria defeatSquid Game achieves Netflix’s biggest launch for a series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

Brae Clinic in Derry is working from a waiting list which commenced on July and there arecurrently  patients waiting to be seen. The waiting lists consists of  face-to-face consultations and  telephone consultations. googletag.cmd.push SineadMcLaughlin, SDLP, said: Waiting lists and waiting times for access to contraceptionservices in Derry and the wider Western Health area have become excessively long. “I am extremely concerned to learn that there are nearly  patients waiting to be seenand that this represents a nine-week queue for access.” She continued: While I am very sympathetic to the situation facing the Western Trust as a result of the pandemic and staff vacancies, lack of access to contraception services may lead to serious social and medical dficulties for many patients. “Family planning is an incredibly important service. It is essential that the Western Trust acts urgently to bring waiting lists and waiting times down as quickly as possible. Health Minister, Robin Swann addressed Stormont regarding the current waiting times for contraception services after McLaughlin addressed the issue. He said the COVID- pandemic had placed “immense pressure on an already reduced service.” Western Health and Social Care Trust have seen immense staff shortages over the last few months. An appeal for staff was released on September  afterAltnagelvinHospital wasunder extreme pressure caring for patients. Commenting on the contraceptive services, WHSC said: “Due to staff sickness and shortages clinics had to be cancelled and clinic capacity reduced based on available staffing levels.”     On June , at Brae Clinic,  patients were waiting for their cancelled appointment to be rescheduled and as of th September these patients have all been seen and the current waiting list wasintroduced. Contraceptionclinics in Omagh and Enniskillen are also experiencing similar problems. On average they are receiving - enquiries per day from patients looking to book anappointment. Vulnerable patients who contact or arereferredto the service are prioritised for treatment.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The new greenway will start at St. Columb’s College,through TheHawthorns to Templemore Road and across to Templemore Sports Complex to UpperGalliaghRoad. The development will continue along the line of the former LoughSwillyrailway line, acrossSkeogeLink Road, and on toElaghBusiness Park. googletag.cmd.push Planning officers had providedseven reasons for refusal. One highly discussed reason to refuse was that the new greenway would run through Zoned HA housing lands. Sinn Fein Councillor Christopher Jackson said: “This is a greenway and something we have been promoting right across our city and district as a positive piece of infrastructure to allow people to choose more sustainable modes of transport.If there is zoned housing there, we should be incorporating the greenway through it.” Head of Planning Maura Fox explained: “The proposal is on housing zoned land. By severing the site with one aspect of the development, you are potentially disallowing houses in part of the zoning which has already been protected for housing.” Ken O’Sullivan, Project Manager, speaking on behalf of the Council said: “We know that the housing master plans for these lands is not yet available and we believe our proposals could be easily incorporated into any future housing masterplans on the lands.” After y debate, Councillors voted nine against refusing the planning officer’s recommendation to refuse, with four voting to for refusing the application.     The Councillors approved the application to go ahead, with conditions. The application had been previously deferred in July this year to allow for a site visit. This proposed greenway will be a part of a wide range of new greenway connections between Derry and the South.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Just a few weeks after completing his incredible Ironman challenge, Danny has hit his target, an amazing sum of money which has been raised on behalf of Pieta and the Bogside and Brandywell Health Forum. googletag.cmd.push Over the course of  days in August, Danny did  Ironman challenges, completing massive numbers which overall consisted of . miles of swimming,  miles cycling and . miles of running. He achieved the incredible feat on the tenth anniversary of his father Colm’s death, and in doing so created a groundswell of support locally and nationally. His efforts have inspired the community, so much so that donations have continued to pour in in the weeks after he finished, leading to the pound, mark being surpassed on Saturday. “This has been one of the hardest and most rewarding few months in my le,” Danny said “I feel like a broken record here but once again, I am simply in awe of the generosity, gratitude and charity of the people of Derry and Donegal. “To everyone that donated from the businesses that had the means to donate large sums right down to the men and women throwing in a pound here and there.

Chamber President Dawn McLaughlin said: “The pandemic has had a hugely detrimental effect on the North West economy, but I have been heartened and filled with pride by the way in which our local business owners and leaders reacted to the crisis before them. “The dinner is a fantastic occasion and opportunity to celebrate our resilience, recognise the strides we have made collectively over the past  months, and commend the efforts made by our local business community in protecting jobs and keeping their companies afloat in the most dficult of circumstances. “As we begin to come out the other side of the pandemic, the time is now for our ministers and our elected representatives at Stormont to prioritise the North West and deliver for our region.     “While the signing off of the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the opening of the School of Medicine at Magee earlier this year were welcome first steps, there is much more that needs to be done to address regional inequality in Northern Ireland and level up the North West City Region. “Ahead of the next Assembly election in spring next year, candidates from all political parties must commit to properly invest in our city, create and attract new jobs to our region, and address deficiencies in our economy. Opportunity “This includes committing to the full expansion of Magee, transforming our physical infrastructure to improve our connectivity to and from other economic hubs, marketing our region to businesses and investors across the globe as a prime location to do business, and properly supporting our businesses as they recover and rebuild post-pandemic. “There is now an opportunity for all key partners in our region – business leaders, elected representatives, educational institutions, civic leaders – to work together and make sure the North West builds back as strongly as it can after Covid, prioritising jobs, investment and prosperity for our businesses and our communities.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Drumboe left Whitehead in Co Antrim, where it has been restored, early on Saturday on its way to the Donegal Railway Heritage Museum in Donegal Town where it will go on display. googletag.cmd.push The -tonne engine, which travelled on a low-loader, passed through Derry, Strabane, Stranorlar, Ballybofey and Barnesmore Gap, before arriving in Donegal Town. It stopped at the Tinneys in Strabane, the former site of the railway station to which it made its last journey in December . The engine also stopped on Barnesmore Gap, the scene of many iconic photographs of the engine in its heyday. Following its arrivial in Donegal Town, Drumboe will be lted into position on a new presentation  at the museum. The Drumboe engine was one of half a dozen built for the Donegal railways in  and . It has become the iconic steam engine of the era of railways in Donegal.Two years in the making The project tothe engine into the county cost €, with funding from Leader on top of fundraising. Theof the engine has been more than two years in the making. As well as the restoration of the engine, the project has included the building of a new presentation  and canopy at the museum. The manager of the museum Nial McCaughan explained there is a lot of excitement about theof the engine.     “This is a big thing for the museum but also for the county,” he said. “This is the first Donegal steam engine to be back in the county. It’s also the very engine that sadly left on the very last journey on December,   - the very last passenger service that left Donegal Town for Strabane. So it has come full circle - it is coming back to Donegal Town and it is a great thing for us all.” He said there are plans that the engine, which has been restored “from a rusting hulk,” will be run again on tracks in Donegal. Most of the engine has been fully restored to an operational state so that when funding becomes available, it could go back into steam. “We would love to put Drumboe back in operation - that is that plan,” he said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Greacuteasaacuten and Gael Linn – one of the main Irish Language organisations in Ireland – have published an open letter to the Department in North asking them to intervene. The letter was signed by over  teachers, speakers and activists. googletag.cmd.push In it, the letter said the  disapplication of the requirement for all pupils to study an additional language at GCSE, “had detrimental consequences for the study of languages and Irish in particular”. The letter also cited a  per cent reduction of students studying Irish at GCSE level since  and called for the  disapplication to be reversed so that pupils must pick a language as one of their GCSE choices – be it Irish, French, German or Spanish. Sinn Feacutein MLA Delargy said: “I have great admiration and respect for the teachers who have signed this letter and are demanding better from the Department. “The figures presented in the letter make for stark reading, it is clear the emphasis of the curriculum has placed on STEMsubjects over recent years to the detriment of languages. “There have been numerous shortcomings from the Department over the last number of years in relation to the language, these trends must be reversed. “While the Irish medium sector continues to grow unbounded, it’s time to look at the language and other languages within the English Medium Sector.     “Sinn Feacutein supports the demands made in the letter and will engage with the Department as they encourage our pupils to study a language.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Foyle MLA also confirmed that Sinn Feacutein will bring a motion to the Assembly on Monday calling for action to end this crisis. A drop in the number of HGV drivers, due to European workers now seeking work in EU member states following Britains exit from the EU, has led to supermarkets and petrol stations in Great Britain reporting of shortages. googletag.cmd.push The north of Ireland is in a dferent situation as due to it retaining its Single Market status post-Brexit, goods and petrol have been in supply. However, Delargy said the norths own economy needed HGV drivers from the EU to ensure that shoppers and car drivers can still have at-point-access to goods and fuel. He said: “Boris Johnson and his government’s Brexit has created a crisis in the production of agri-food and the transporting of goods through lorry driver shortages. “Alongside the reckless move to end freedom of movement with its xenophobic undercurrents which has seen many EU citizens leaving, the Tories are refusing to recognise the need to ensure skilled workers from across the EU who want to work here can do so. “The British Government needs to find a solution to the problem of labour shortages which they created through their hard Brexit and ensure EU citizens can work in the north. “Sinn Feacutein’s Assembly motion calls on the Economy Minister to put pressure on the British government to act to end the labour shortage crisis and resolve the issues facing workers and local businesses.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Imagine a student in France being told they could not study French or through French. It just would not be tolerated.ldquoThis situation is compounded by the fact that, outside of the post-primary sector, not one single centre of learning in Derry City is providing A Level Irish for adult learners or ers.ldquoHow has this situation been allowed to develop and where will our future naacuteiscoil, bunscoil and meaacutenscoil teachers, not to mention our university lecturers, come fromurgent remedial action is not taken to reverse this sad decline  I do not understand how anyone, with direct or indirect responsibility for Irish education, has allowed this to happen.Speaking to the Derry News, Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the Director of Education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the ldquocritical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who ldquofelt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action.They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Gael Linn is a non-profit and non-governmental organisation focused on the promotion of the Irish language and the arts.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein said: ldquoThe legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals will have to realise that the Irish language is more than a school subject. In some schools in the area this is already the case.ldquoFor many, Irish is their native language and, therefore, they should have every opportunity to learn it to the highest level in education. It needs to be facilitated, not made dficult. If the system makes it dficult or less desirable to study a given subject, what will happen inside a number of years is that there will be a decreased demand, where there was once was a greater organic demand.ldquoConversely,we start with the view, whatever happens, we must offer Irish in our school, things will be better for the Irish and its learning.ldquoThe problem of Year  students, in other areas, who chose Irish A Level being unable to study it as a result of time-tabling issues, between schools and their area learning community, has been brought to the attention of Gael Linn. It often starts further down the school when pupils choose Irish and by doing so miss out on another language or subject, or choose another subject and miss out on Irish.RELATEDAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonldquoThere is a perception Irish is marked more severely than other subjects and both teachers and pupils know it may be more dficult to achieve and A*. If students do not study Irish in the first place, for instance, they will not take it later on or at college.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein added that the system made it dficult for pupils to opt for Irish and other languages and then claims there is little or no demand for the subject.ldquoI do not think this is equitable, he said. ldquoEvery effort should be made so that all pupils can study Irish, or other languages, to A Level and in the case of pupils from Gaelscoileanna, it is obvious that the continuity in language learning should be in place.ldquoIf there was legislation in place to promote Irish language rights, as promised in the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, these are precisely the issues a Commissioner for the Irish language would address. A Commissioner could ensure equitable access to Irish language as far as University, which is more than just a school subject.ldquoUlster University, Magee, has an excellent reputation for the study of Irish and one would have thought, therefore, that all the schools in the area, where Irish would have been traditionally offered, would do their best to offer Irish to A Level as a key into university, the local university in particular.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein was confident the situation could be reversed.He recalled: ldquoIn , Irish teachers and supporters came together to campaign for the overturning of a proposal, which at the time was being brought forward by the then Minister of Education, Brian Mawhinney. The proposal would have marginalised and downgraded the Irish language. This campaign was successful.ldquoWhat is happening now across the North is Mawhinney by the backdoor, in my opinion. Irish and other languages are being marginalised and their importance downgraded. This makes me sad but ready to campaign for our special native language to have its rightful place in our education system, along with other languages.ldquoIf students dont get to study Irish, few will end up going to spend time on residential courses in the Gaeltacht, such as those organised by Gael Linn. These courses represent an important rite of passage for thousands of students each summer. However, they rely on students studying Irish at GCSE and A Level to remain viable.ldquoThe Foyle Learning Community has, apparently, failed children who wanted to study A Level Irish because authorities in the area have not been allowing for the rightful signicance of the Irish language in the lives of many pupils in that area and in other areas also. They must have overlooked the signicant cohort of Gaelscoil pupils who would naturally wish to take Irish at GCSE and A Level.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein reiterated that Irish was more than a school subject. He said it should be made available.ldquoNothing short of maximum availability will suffice when it comes to the Irish language, our native language, he said. ldquoWe are all aware of the importance of lelong learning and there should be pathways to GCSE, A Level, diploma, degree and postgraduate study for adults and young people who wish to continue learning Irish while working or after leaving post-primary education. There should be incentives for institutions to offer Irish in this way.ldquoIrish, as a taught subject, is in danger of being available to fewer and fewer students as time progresses. This stems from the disapplication of the requirement to take a language at GCSE taken by the Government in Westminster in , coupled with the excessive emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathssubjects.ldquoIt began to impact in , at the same time as the economic crisis, followed by Brexit confusion and, more recently, Covid-. The crisis in Irish language learning cannot be allowed to deteriorate further. It is too important to us all, even though we dont all realise this as much as we should.ldquoIf this situation continues, fewer students will continue to study Irish at university and this despite the increased demand for Irish in the workplace across the island.

It often starts further down the school when pupils choose Irish and by doing so miss out on another language or subject, or choose another subject and miss out on Irish.RELATEDAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonldquoThere is a perception Irish is marked more severely than other subjects and both teachers and pupils know it may be more dficult to achieve and A*. If students do not study Irish in the first place, for instance, they will not take it later on or at college.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein added that the system made it dficult for pupils to opt for Irish and other languages and then claims there is little or no demand for the subject.ldquoI do not think this is equitable, he said. ldquoEvery effort should be made so that all pupils can study Irish, or other languages, to A Level and in the case of pupils from Gaelscoileanna, it is obvious that the continuity in language learning should be in place.ldquoIf there was legislation in place to promote Irish language rights, as promised in the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, these are precisely the issues a Commissioner for the Irish language would address. A Commissioner could ensure equitable access to Irish language as far as University, which is more than just a school subject.ldquoUlster University, Magee, has an excellent reputation for the study of Irish and one would have thought, therefore, that all the schools in the area, where Irish would have been traditionally offered, would do their best to offer Irish to A Level as a key into university, the local university in particular.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein was confident the situation could be reversed.He recalled: ldquoIn , Irish teachers and supporters came together to campaign for the overturning of a proposal, which at the time was being brought forward by the then Minister of Education, Brian Mawhinney. The proposal would have marginalised and downgraded the Irish language. This campaign was successful.ldquoWhat is happening now across the North is Mawhinney by the backdoor, in my opinion. Irish and other languages are being marginalised and their importance downgraded. This makes me sad but ready to campaign for our special native language to have its rightful place in our education system, along with other languages.ldquoIf students dont get to study Irish, few will end up going to spend time on residential courses in the Gaeltacht, such as those organised by Gael Linn. These courses represent an important rite of passage for thousands of students each summer. However, they rely on students studying Irish at GCSE and A Level to remain viable.ldquoThe Foyle Learning Community has, apparently, failed children who wanted to study A Level Irish because authorities in the area have not been allowing for the rightful signicance of the Irish language in the lives of many pupils in that area and in other areas also. They must have overlooked the signicant cohort of Gaelscoil pupils who would naturally wish to take Irish at GCSE and A Level.Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein reiterated that Irish was more than a school subject. He said it should be made available.ldquoNothing short of maximum availability will suffice when it comes to the Irish language, our native language, he said. ldquoWe are all aware of the importance of lelong learning and there should be pathways to GCSE, A Level, diploma, degree and postgraduate study for adults and young people who wish to continue learning Irish while working or after leaving post-primary education. There should be incentives for institutions to offer Irish in this way.ldquoIrish, as a taught subject, is in danger of being available to fewer and fewer students as time progresses. This stems from the disapplication of the requirement to take a language at GCSE taken by the Government in Westminster in , coupled with the excessive emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathssubjects.ldquoIt began to impact in , at the same time as the economic crisis, followed by Brexit confusion and, more recently, Covid-. The crisis in Irish language learning cannot be allowed to deteriorate further. It is too important to us all, even though we dont all realise this as much as we should.ldquoIf this situation continues, fewer students will continue to study Irish at university and this despite the increased demand for Irish in the workplace across the island.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The balance on how to create nutritious, easy-to-prepare school lunches five days a week that kids will love too is a continuous challenge. Healthy Heroes, the lunchtime nutrition programme from the Irish Bread Bakers Association and Bord Bia, offers plenty of simple suggestions. googletag.cmd.push Their latest programme is already underway in hundreds of primary schools around the country aiming to help children improve their eating habits for the better and increase their fitness levels. Studies show that just one in ten Irish childrenmeet the national physical activity guidelines, while at least one in five nationally are still overweight or obese. Created by teachers and behaviour change experts, with the support of Dr Mary McCreery, one of Ireland’s leading consultant nutritionists and dieticians, the schools-based lunchtime programme recognises the importance of intervening early so children develop healthy eating behaviours before they leave primary school. It aims to increase the nutritional value of the lunch box with useful tips and suggestions on ways to include fruit and vegetables in lunch boxes as well as easy – to- understand information on the food pyramid and the contents of the ideal lunch box. The programme involves a novel peer learning approach with sixth class students mentoring younger students on the importance of nutrition and being active. This provides the younger children with important role models, while the older children have an opportunity to foster valuable leadership, teamwork, and communication skills. According to Dr McCreery, school lunchtime is an important opportunity to develop positive attitudes towards food choices and nutrition, leading to le-long eating habits. She offersthe following tips to parents when it comes to school lunches:     Set a good example by eating a iety of foods yourself and make your own lunch at the same time so your child knows how much you enjoy them.Introduce new foods without any special comment so your child can make their own mind upthey like them or not. Make sure you have a wide range of foods available at home. Try to offer dferent foods every day. Shopping in advance is the best way to ensure you have plenty of iety for lunch boxes. Include a carbohydrate, a protein, dairy, fruit, and veg in their lunch boxes. To provide a balanced diet educate your child that treats are for weekends and special occasions. Involve your child in the food shopping to encourage themto pick healthy options for their school lunch. And here are some balanced lunch suggestions from the latest Healthy Heroes programme.

A European Studies student from Waterford, Maireacutead Butler, will use the opportunity to raise awareness with Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin about the challenges still facing girls and women. Speaking about the event, Maireacutead said it isnt good enough that no woman has ever held the office of Taoiseach, but that she was delighted to be part of the takeover. googletag.cmd.push She said, I hope girls across the country will see this and be able to envision themselves in this office one day. The  year old, who is a member of Plan International Irelands Youth Advisory Panel, will also discuss the results of the groups recent research into sexual and reproductive health misinformation in Irish schools. She said, Im grateful to have the opportunity to present the findings to the Taoiseach today.Most concerning were the responses we received about consent, contraception and LGBTI+ identities. “The reality is that when young people are not armed with the right info on sexual and reproductive health, girls and young women are at particular risk of being subjected to sexual and gender-based violence and early pregnancy. Similar takeover events are taking place around the world today, giving girls and young women the chance to sit in the seats of leaders in politics and business, particularly traditionally male-dominated positions.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Local NewsPolice launch murder investigation after County Derry fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Hollywood star Jamie Lee Curtis could be making an appearance at s Derry Halloween event to promote the final part of the Halloween film trilogyLocal NewsScream Queen Jamie Lee pencils in Derry Halloween date overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Plans for the new greenway between Derry and ElaghDerry NewsCross-border greenway between Derry and Elagh approved overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jimmy Carr will be back with his new show at the Millennium Forum Derry NewsJimmy Carr, Rob Beckett, Nathan Carter and many more set to take to the Derry stage overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  People will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s National NewsPeople will quit their jobstheyre not getting what they want, Expert predicts raft of resignations as office work s overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Drumboe about to leave Whitehead in Co Antrim where it has been restored PICTURE: Donegal Railway Heritage MuseumLocal NewsFamous steam engine begins journey back to Donegal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates. The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"‘Huge stress’ for families to find affordable home  ","story":"THE growing need to address the districtrsquos social housing crisis is urgent, Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason has warned.She says there are many across communities who are struggling to access affordable housing which is having a huge impact on their lives.She also says she has been contacted by many people who are unable to find an affordable home, with some revealing that they have had to relocate to other areas after having lived in their home village all their lives.She said that having to move has caused ldquohuge stress for some families and can simply not be allowed to continue.ldquoFor far too long now, the current wastewater systems in Drumaness and Loughinisland have been operating at full capacity and are no longer fit for purpose. This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address.

Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table.

Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances.

She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions.

Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out. She finished in . after reaching half way in . setting a negative split in her enthusiasm to reach the finish.She mentioned that her husband Johntook part in the Festival of Running laid on for the supporters and said that this would be another reason to recommend the event to anyone considering an entry in the future.With all the talk of mileage, we mustnrsquot forget that challenges come in many dferent forms.Neil McCartan is highly unlikely to do a marathon as for him speed is king. He sticks to the track with m his preferred event with races up to K the norm.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a

confirmed a public inquiry would not be ordered into the project being spearheaded by Ravenblack Developments, which is also proposing to provide a new cafe, craft and chandlery shop and a mill house.It is understood local planners, who are currently examining the detail of the plan, could make their decision before the end of the year.The developers say they are confident the scheme will

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13096193.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsDUP Ministers urged to quit roles by unionist rival Jim Allister after High Court rules boycott of North-South meetings unlawfulMan accused of killing cyclist Shaun Mullan, , by careless driving acquitted‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyWorkman sent videos of himself masturbating over women’s photos in their homesMost PopularUK could suspend Northern Ireland Protocol to safeguard peace, says FrostPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedDonaldson against ‘having to accept laws of court over which we have no control’Almost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannAurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach Earth                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The resulting health crisis shows the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. The tendency to shirk responsibility, to think short-term and to ignore hard choicesOn Saturday, I fell off my bicycle and smashed my left wrist. As a result, firstly I was sedated and given a procedure to stabilise and reposition the bone. Then, the next morning, my joint was rebuilt during several hours of surgery at Royal Victoria Hospital. I’ve written about the NHS quite a bit over the years. But an up close and personal experience always helps put things in a sharper perspective.That’s primarily because, as a patient, you can’t help but be struck by the kindness, dedication and professionalism of almost every member of staff you meet in hospital.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...They really are remarkable people, with reserves of caring and empathy that most of us can only wonder at. It’s all the more impressive that they display these qualities under such challenging circumstances.For example, the nurses who show endless reserves of patience through the small hours of the night while they are abused and sometimes even threatened by distressed patients. These are often older people, confused and delirious, who are not in any way responsible for their behaviour, but they still say hurtful, potentially intimidating things. It’s a special skill to be able to deal with that, calmly and firmly, in the middle of a busy sht.When you are in hospital receiving care, you see that staff are working incredibly hard, often without breaks, while remaining helpful, interested and sympathetic to every patient. But there are dficulties with the system too. It is busy and struggling to cope.I was unfortunate, or perhaps not, that I had an open wound on my broken joint. There was a risk that it would become infected and that was why I had my operation quickly. The surgeons were blunt that,it hadn’t been for the cut, I would probably have had to wait much longer. Indeed, many patients were waiting considerable s of time, some of them in terrible pain, for essential operations on broken legs, hips and other bones or joints. The lists for emergency surgery are long and growing.There is clearly considerable pressure on beds, with some people waiting in discomfort in A  E or in inappropriate wards or bays. But, at the same time, it can be a y and frustrating process being discharged, even after that decision has been taken and plans have been made to fill the bed. Everybody’s doing their jobs with the utmost professionalism, but there are snags and bottlenecks that hold everything up and give an impression of inefficiency.For an explanation, we have to go back to Stormont and the failure of successive health ministers to reform the NHS in Northern Ireland. Since at least , and the Transforming Your Care report, but arguably as long ago as  when the late Maurice Hayes published his recommendations, experts have repeatedly pointed out what needs to happen.We know that there should be a smaller number of acute hospitals with a greater concentration of expertise and more resources should be directed at providing care in the community. In addition, there are dficulties with staffing, particularly in certain jobs and specialties. Rather than act on these requirements, the executive at Stormont repeatedly delayed taking necessary but potentially unpopular decisions.In , the Donaldson Report made specic recommendations to close facilities and reorganise services. It was parked, due to one of Stormont’s periodic crises, and when the assembly got back to some sort of normality, in , the new minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill, commissioned a new review, Bengoa, which made broadly the same points, but presented them in more general terms. It’s an endless, circular process sustained by politicians who refuse to take responsibility for dficult decisions, like closing smaller hospitals. The latest incumbent at the health ministry, Robin Swann, has had to deal with Covid, so you can understand perhaps why reform has not taken priority, but no great change seems imminent. Remember that, just before coronavirus arrived, in December , there was already a nurses’ strike and medics predicted that the system was close to breakdown.The pattern is clear, and Stormont’s refusal to act has allowed NI’s NHS to become outdated in comparison with services in the rest of the UK. Our politicians have let down its brilliant employees badly and repeatedly. Indeed, the crisis in health offers a neat case-study of many of the inbuilt problems with our devolved institutions. Their tendency to encourage shirking responsibility, thinking only about the short-term, taking the easiest choices and ignoring more dficult ones, blaming everybody .Unavoidably, the unionist parties’ most pressing problem at the next election is the protocol. However, in terms of making Stormont work, an honest, responsible approach to government that confronts long-term problems, rather than denying or ignoring them, is something that voters will think is long overdue.Royal Victoria HospitalNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularDennis Hutchings challenges evidence in trial over  killing that identies him as a soldier in witness statementsDUP Ministers urged to quit roles by unionist rival Jim Allister after High Court rules boycott of North-South meetings unlawfulMan accused of killing cyclist Shaun Mullan, , by careless driving acquitted‘If police could stop Al Capone a century ago, they can stop SEA UDA today’ – Sammy Wilson hits out as inquest reveals tragic last days of Carrick loyalist Mark GourleyWorkman sent videos of himself masturbating over women’s photos in their homesMost PopularUK could suspend Northern Ireland Protocol to safeguard peace, says FrostPan unionist legal challenge to NI protocol on hold as changes expectedDonaldson against ‘having to accept laws of court over which we have no control’Almost all medicines in Northern Ireland will be disrupted by the EU border in the Irish Sea, warns Stormont’s health minister Robin SwannAurora Borealis: Northern Lights could be visible in NI as geomagnetic storm expected to reach Earth                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is an historically recognised fact that Fr Reid was instrumental in helping to broker the IRA ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. He was persistent in his efforts to persuade the republican movement, and indeed loyalists, to lay down their arms and pursue their aims exclusively through democratic politics. Fr Reynolds also reached out tirelessly to his brothers and sisters in Christ within the Protestant Churches and built many bridges to draw them together in greater respect and practical partnerships. Indeed, Fr Gerry and Fr Alec contributed signicantly to the growing openness that prevails today and to that dream of a more peaceful, integrated and flourishing society to which many now aspire.The increasing numbers of Protestants and unionists who attend Clonard’s social, cultural and spiritual events indicates that the monastery’s “reputation with unionists” was not “sullied” but rather enhanced by the friendship and ministry of Fr Reid and Fr Reynolds. It is today respected as one of the most open, welcoming, and inclusive sacred spaces in the city for those of ious religious, social and political convictions, and none. Those of us who have lived our lives for years in the company of Fr Alec and Fr Gerry, and who know from personal experience the thinking of their minds and the aspirations of their hearts for peace and reconciliation realise how hollow and painful are the baseless allegations made against them. But for those who have not had this privilege, we would encourage you to read the inspiring accounts of their lives for yourselves and draw your own conclusions One man, one God: the Peace Ministry of Fr Alec Reid by Martin McKeever Unity Pilgrim: The le of Fr Gerry Reynolds by Gladys Ganiel.

Jim Dennison Simon Community Chief Executive, Upper Bann SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly, Lurgan Councillor with Armagh,Banbridge and Craigavon Council Cllr Ciaran Toman and Director of Homelessness Services for Simon Community Kirsten Hewitt.There’s also a floating support service that covers the local area, helping people secure and maintain their tenancy. Floating Support Officers provide practical support and advice to vulnerable people within their own homes and the community.Currently, the charity has no private rental homes in the Portadown region however an Assets Manager will join Simon Community in November to begin identying need and affordable housing options for clients in the area.The charity’s Chief Executive, Jim Dennison, met with MLAs at Parliament Buildings to outline plans, which includes recruiting an Assets Development Manager who will oversee the acquisition and management of rental properties in areas of highest need.Mr Dennison said: “We are in a homelessness crisis. The NIHE’s own statistics show that homelessness services are currently not meeting demand, and that demand is predicted to grow in the coming years. This initiative is a response to that crisis.”Jim Dennison Simon Community Chief Executive, Upper Bann DUP MLA Diane Dodds and Director of Homelessness Services for Simon Community Kirsten Hewitt.Upper Bann MLA John O’Dowd said: “I commend the Simon Community for the work they have done and continue to do in tackling homelessness. The charity’s latest scheme to become landlords for those in housing need will undoubtedly bring a roof over the heads of those in need in conjunction with a caring supportive landlord.”Simon Community is also calling on local businesses to support its Creating Homes programme by providing funding for paint and building supplies to create a valued home for people within their communities.

freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
