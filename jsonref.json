He admired her very much then, and he admires her to this day. Judge Kavanaugh and Ms. Dolphin attended one high school event together and shared a brief kiss good night following that event.‘They had no other such encounter. The language from Judge Kavanaugh’s high school yearbook refers to the fact that he and Ms. Dolphin attended that one high school event together and nothing else.’However, Dolphin also contradicted the assertion by Kavanaugh’s lawyers that the two shared a brief kiss in high school.‘I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,’ she told The New York Times through her lawyer.Kavanaugh was one of 13 graduating seniors who reportedly mentioned Dolphin in some way in the yearbook. One former student, Michael Walsh, wrote a poem in his yearbook that said: ‘You need a date  and it\u0027s getting late  so don\u0027t hesitate  to call Renate.’According to a person close to Dolphin, she was aware of the poem being recited by her former classmates and requested that they stop saying it.Kavanaugh has come under intense scrutiny lately for allegedly sexually assaulting former classmates Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.

View days: Multiple sources tell DailyMail.com that Rosie O\u0027Donnell is the top choice, while other names being floated around include Ann Curry and Lisa Ling (O\u0027Donnell and Barbara Walters on The View)          Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism.

Here’s all you need to know about her, including her relationship with Kavanaugh and the allegations she’s made against him.Who is Julie Swetnick?Julie Swetnick is the third woman to publicly allege that U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct.Swetnick, 55, currently lives in Washington, D.C. and attended the University of Maryland and Montgomery College.She’s reportedly spent years working for the Federal government in Washington, D.C., including currently at the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Mint and has previously held security clearances for the Department of Justice, the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security.Additionally, she’s also believed to have previously worked with the Vietnam War Commission and is reportedly one of the first 100 women in the entire world to have earned a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineering Certification.While attending high school in Gaithersburg, Maryland between in the early 1980s, she claims to have met Kavanaugh at a house party in the Washington, D.C. area and says she was present when Kavanaugh and his friends, including Mark Judge, allegedly drugged girls’ drinks and participated in gang rapes.According to a sworn declaration released by Avenatti on Twitter, Swetnick alleges: ‘I first met Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh in approximately 1980-1981. I was introduced to them at a house party that I attended in the Washington D.C. area.‘Following that first introduction, I attended well over ten house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present…‘On numerous occasions at these parties, I witnessed Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking no for an answer. This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 26th SeptemberWhat\u0027s coming to Netflix October 2018: New releases on the streaming siteSaina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap announce wedding after revealing \u002710-year relationship\u0027A replica of Meghan Markle\u0027s engagement ring is on sale at The Royal Collection shopSony allows cross-console play on PlayStation 4 starting with FortniteWho is Chloe Zhao?

A native of Sacramento, Honnold grew up near El Capitan and called it the ‘pinnacle of climbing.’ Honnold is pictured here on top of El Cap looking down          It took Honnold a year and a half to prepare for the free solo - meaning alone and without any equipment - climb of El Capitan. He told DailyMail.com that he climbed the mountain with a rope around 60 times (pictured with Honnold in red on the left with his climbing partner on the right) and he rehearsed his moves for the challenging parts of the formation over and over again          A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 shows how Honnold (pictured) would ultimately be the first person ever to climb El Capitan without a rope and alone, where one slip would mean death. On June 3, 2017, it took three hours and 56 minutes for him to scale the iconic and daunting rock formation          Honnold (pictured) told DailyMail.com that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died. He said that is why he prepared so vigorously, working on difficult sections until they felt comfortable so that he would be able to solo the route. For one challenging part called the boulder problem, Honnold explained that he practiced on that section 12 times in a rowThe preparation to scale El Capitan without any equipment was vigorous and Honnold explained that he climbed it with a rope around 60 times, but ‘in a lot ways that doesn’t really do justice to how much I actually rehearsed because that’s only counting actual ascents where you start at the bottom and climb all the way to the top. I had many many days where I would hike to the top and then rappel back down to the ground just to work on one section.’If the route did not included certain sections, he said he would have been able to climb it immediately.Honnold said: ‘I would just go up and work on them in whatever way I could, so sometimes that meant climbing from the ground, sometimes that meant rappelling down from the summit, like hiking to the top and then rappelling down and… then one by one I just sort of worked on the sections until they felt comfortable, and then eventually, you know, once they all felt comfortable, was able to solo the whole route.’For example, for what is termed the boulder problem, which included doing a karate kick with no rope on the rock face to continue the climb, Honnold explained that he hiked to the top of El Capitan, rappelled down and then practiced it 12 times in a row.Masters of rock: Climbers shatter El Capitan\u0027s speed record...Daredevil climber makes history as the first to scale...Share this articleHonnold grew up in Sacramento, California, which is near El Capitan. In the film, he describes himself as shy and melancholic, often playing with Legos. He told DailyMail.com he started climbing around 10 or 11.‘To me it represents the ultimate in climbing and it has for many years,’ he said of El Capitan. ‘I’ve been thinking about it for, well, since 2009, which is pretty long time to be dreaming of something.’He called the documentary ‘very honest’ and a ‘very real look’ at the last two years of his life.In the beginning of the documentary, which starts in spring 2016, Honnold is living in a van - which he has lived in for nine years, six of those in a Walmart parking lot - and says he is \u0027trending\u0027 toward having a girlfriend, but that he \u0027will always choose climbing over a lady.’That girlfriend is Sanni McCandless, who meet Honnold while he was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. When McCandless asked him to sign her copy, she gave him her number.The documentary traces the journey of their relationship: McCandless climbing with him, hanging out in Honnold’s van, how they navigate the risk of death associated with his lifelong passion and dream, the hiccups along the way when he gets injured twice, and getting a place together in Las Vegas.In the film, McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death. ‘I’m not super stoked when he goes soloing because he’s already a big part of my life,’ McCandless says in the film.Before his first free solo attempt, which would not be successful, McCandless asks, ‘Would putting me into the equation actually ever change anything?’ Honnold says no, and that he wouldn\u0027t want to have ‘weird simmering resentment’ that ‘the things you love most in life have now been squashed.’           The documentary looks at Honnold\u0027s relationship with his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless (right). They met while Honnold (left) was on tour for his book, ‘Alone on the Wall,’ in Seattle. Here, as seen in the film, McCandless is cutting Honnold\u0027s hair before he attempts climbing El Capitan for the first time, an unsuccessful attempt that he ultimately bailed on   A new documentary, \u0027Free Solo,\u0027 features both Alex Honnold and Sanni McCandless (above) and their relationship. The film chronicles how Honnold climbs El Capitan without any safety gear, and McCandless grapples with how to support Honnold in his pursuit while she worries that the endeavor could mean his death          At the time the documentary was filmed, starting in late 2015 until his successful free solo of El Cap in summer 2017, Honnold had lived in his van for nine years (pictured above) but not because of financial necessity. Toward the end of the film, he buys a house in Las Vegas, which he shares with his girlfriend Sanni McCandless          As of now, Honnold told DailyMail.com that he has climbed El Capitan with a rope 80 times. Above, is Honnold (right) with Tommy Caldwell, (left), who is a professional climber, preparing with practice runs with equipment before Honnold\u0027s historic climb of the rock formation without a rope on June 3, 2017When Honnold does make the climbing attempt that ultimately proves successful, McCandless leaves Yosemite. In the film, Honnold says he didn\u0027t ask her to leave but that she understands it is easier if she’s gone. Tears form as she drives away, contemplating the \u0027weird thought\u0027 of that possibly being their last hug. By the time she is being interviewed, she is crying, and wondering what if something happens and she doesn\u0027t see him again.Honnold told DailyMail.com he is still with McCandless and ‘she’s awesome.’ After seeing the documentary, he reflected on his conversations with her and his family and ‘it’s a good reminder that I could maybe be a little more thoughtful or a little more kind.’He added: ‘It’s funny because I think my experience watching it is kind of the opposite of most audiences in that, I find all of the, you know, the first hour of so is my relationship and just my personal life, I find that really challenging to watch, but then the climbing I think is amazing and I love watching it. I think that it seems most audiences feel deeply uncomfortable watching the climbing but the rest of it they find enjoyable.’ Honnold’s father, who often took him climbing and whom Honnold describes in the film as a \u0027teddy bear,\u0027 died when he was 19. His parents orced before he died. His mother, Dierdre Wolownick, a French professor, says in the film about his free soloing, ‘That\u0027s when he feels most alive, the most everything (and) how can you even think about taking that away from somebody.’The documentary opens with Honnold climbing, his orange shirt bright against El Capitan’s granite rock – the only sounds are his breathing and the call of birds.‘I feel like anybody could conceivably die on any given day - soloing makes it feel far more immediate and much more present,’ Honnold then says during an interview in the film, and adding later, ‘That’s kind of one of the appeals of free soloing to take something that seems difficult and dangerous and make it feel safe.’Honnold processes fear differently - to the point that he gets a MRI during the film to see how he responds to risk. Free soloing is dangerous, and Honnold notes in the film that everyone who made free soloing a part of their life has died. The film also shows a montage of free solo climbers - John Bachar, Sean Leary, Dan Osman and Dean Potter – who had died.  When asked about this, Honnold pointed out to DailyMail.com that they didn’t all die soloing - some died attempting other high-risk activities such as BASE jumping.He said that he thought ‘extensively’ about the risk: if he fell, he would have died.‘I mean that’s why there’s a year and a half of preparation, that’s why it was so important to me to make sure that when I did it, I did it right because, you know, obviously, I don’t want to die,’ he said.           Free soloing - climbing alone and without equipment such as a harness or rope - is a dangerous endeavor. A \u002760 Minutes\u0027 segment, featured in the documentary, of Alex Honnold (pictured in red, right, with a member of the documentary film crew, left) stated that free soloing is so dangerous less than one percent of people who climb, attempt it. Honnold has done more than 1,000 free solo climbs, according to the segment          Documentary filmmaker Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (left) directed \u0027Free Solo\u0027 with her husband Jimmy Chin, (right) who is a professional climber. Chin and Honnold have been friends for years and have worked together before. Vasarhelyi told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project - a character portrait of Honnold - together          A behind-the-scenes look at the documentary, \u0027Free Solo\u0027 (pictured). The project started around October 2015, said Vasarhelyi, one of the film\u0027s directors, with filming in Yosemite began in earnest by spring 2016. She said the project took about three and a half years  to completeElizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who co-directed the film with her husband, Jimmy Chin, said they both ‘took time to reflect on whether this was something we would even participate in because of all the ethical questions around it because the stakes were just simply so high.’Vasarhelyi, who is an award-winning documentarian of five films before ‘Free Solo,’ told DailyMail.com that they envisioned the project together.She said: ‘There’s this original anecdote about Alex as a kid where he found it scarier to speak to somebody else to ask them to be his partner than to go to climbing by himself and hence without a rope... It still always brings tears to my eyes when I think about this anecdote because I feel like we all have that in our lives, and the idea that this inidual, this kid went from that to free soloing is staggering for me, for us.’ Chin, a professional climber, and Honnold have been friends for years, and have worked together before, but Vasarhelyi had only met him once socially. It was when they got together before the project began that Honnold mentioned how he wanted to climb El Capitan without a rope.‘He had never said it out loud,’ before, she explained. ‘He truly believed there’s nothing worth making a film about unless it was El Cap. But it changed the game, you know.’Vasarhelyi said the questions were whether they trusted Honnold or not to make the right decision in the moment, and whether they trusted themselves that they could execute it well enough as well as brave the worst case scenario.‘It comes down to the existential question at the heart of the movie itself, which is the idea of a life well-lived. Alex thinks a lot of death, he knows exactly how he wants to live his life… and we both respect that deeply,’ she said.In the documentary, Honnold’s first attempt to climb El Capitan isn’t successful, and he ends up bailing.‘In some ways it’s kind of reassuring that Spock has nerves,’ Chin says in the film, referring to Honnold\u0027s stoic nature.          Jimmy Chin, (pictured), is a professional climber and has known Honnold and worked with him for years. Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold to film was an elite professional climber as well as a cinematographer          Initially, the documentary filmmakers, Vasarhelyi and Chin, did not intend to put the crew into the film (shown above, right, with Honnold, left in the red jacket). Chin said that it became clear while editing it that the crew was an integral part of the story. The film showcases Honnold\u0027s climb of El Capitan without a rope, and it also shows the crew - many of them professional climbers themselves - as they film and watch Honnold. Tension runs high because if Honnold had made a mistake, he would have died          El Capitan in Yosemite National Park in California (pictured) is considered the center of the rock climbing universe for many. Honnold, who was the first ever to climb it alone and without rope, said it represents the ultimate in climbing to him, and he has been dreaming of the free solo climb since 2009 Vasarhelyi, who has two children with Chin, recalled the project starting and her telling Honnold she was pregnant.‘We began filming about when I was seven months pregnant so like October 2015,’ she said.Filming, she said, began in earnest in Yosemite by spring 2016, and they spent three and a half years on the documentary.Chin told DailyMail.com that everyone who went up the mountain with Honnold was an elite professional climber and a cinematographer.He said: ‘It’s a small circle and so we all know each other. Several of them have been Alex’s climbing partners, I mean, they’re at that level. But Alex is at a totally different level. But the thing is it was a very close knit team, you know, part of why it worked so well, it was a very family, kind of intimate feeling production.’The crew is also featured in the documentary, building tension at the end as they watch Honnold make the historic climb.‘We went into the project not intending to put the production – myself or any of the crew - into the film,’ Chin said. ‘In the edit, you know, we really started to see that it was kind of an integral part of the story because it was kind of this group effort and this journey together and to exclude it, actually felt like it wouldn’t be an honest film.’Chin, who said he has been filming and working with top athletes for 20 years, said he has never seen anything like what Honnold pulled off.‘It’s hard to contextualize, it really in my mind is one of the greatest athletic feats,’ he said. ‘The stakes don’t get higher than performing perfectly when the stakes are that high for that long - that’s truly an incredible feat.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/14/11/4D21013100000578-0-image-a-13_1528972598534.jpg","title":"Move pound shops rise 5 store only5Pounds","story":"    Only5Pounds has opened its first bricks-and-mortar store in Northampton (pictured above)          Only5Pounds mostly sells home and DIY products as well as some electricals and toysThe first Only5Pounds shop is up-and-running in Northampton, selling most of the same products it does online as well as some store-exclusive food and drink items - around 2,400 items in total. The business hopes to target other areas in the south such as Harrow, Luton and Watford in the near future, before venturing into the Midlands next year.It told This is Money that it is making a beeline for the shops that were left vacant by Poundworld when it sunk into administration earlier this year.Does the demise of Poundworld portend gloom for all \u0027value\u0027...How did John Lewis – the UK’s High Street darling – have...Estate agent closures to add to High Street malaise as...Share this articleThe collapse triggered around 5,000 job losses and left 350 UK stores up for grabs.Managing director Vinod Chopra said: \u0027The aim is for people to feel that they are getting good value for money. \u0027We want to bring online prices to the high street so everyone can benefit from the savings.\u0027 While the move into physical stores may seem counter-intuitive, Only5Pounds is not the first online business to make the shift from \u0027clicks to bricks\u0027.Online furniture firm Swoon has set up shop inside Debenhams stores, Made.com continues to open showrooms across Europe and even Amazon has touched down on the High Street with its own book shops and the acquisition of Whole Foods.  The retailer said its stock will \u0027always remain at £5\u0027, but the fixed-price model has proven a bind to some retailers in the past.Poundworld, for example, was stung by the falling value of sterling in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. As well as being guilty of over-expanding, Poundland was wed to its £1 price point for too long, which meant it had very little wiggle room and its margins suffered.    Fixed price retailers like Poundworld have struggled to manage the falling value of the poundHowever, Chopra insisted that the model keeps it \u0027simple and consistent for the customer\u0027. He added that by buying products directly from the factory, the business will be able to offer low prices – even when it has additional costs associated with stores – business rates and rents, for example.The Only5Pounds shops will double as click-and-collect points so shoppers can order online and pick up in store. Another website also sells products entirely at a £5 price point - everything5pounds.com - which specialises in fashion.Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/08/0294720B0000044D-6209077-image-m-21_1537947247987.jpg","title":"England home worlds two universities","story":"    Where the top ten UK universities sit in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings          Oxford claims top spot for the third consecutive year. Magdalen College in the city is pictured          Cambridge retains second position this year.

The brightly-coloured abstract window of yellow, red, blue, pink, orange and greens, features hawthorn blossom and stands out in its historic setting  Hockney was commissioned to create the stained glass window at Westminster Abbey to celebrate Queen Elizabeth\u0027s reign The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, added: \u0027I\u0027m excited by it.\u0027I think there\u0027s absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and different.\u0027Some of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautiful, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.\u0027He added: \u0027It\u0027s going to be here until the end. I mean, who knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future! The Abbey\u0027s only been here just over 1,000 years.

Meghan closing her own car door before walking into the opening of \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts Royal experts are thrilled that their cast of characters is being expanded as Kate Middleton is returning to ‘work’ soon after her maternity leave - apparently those appearances at posh weddings were ‘private’ events, in case you wondered.This week the royal watchers went into overdrive, signalling that September 2018 will go down in the history books as the moment when a smiley mixed race woman finally dragged the British monarchy into the 21st century.It was accomplished with a simple- some might say humble- gesture, one that summed up (according to sycophants) her totally ‘modern’ approach to her new toff status. Yes, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, CLOSED HER OWN CAR DOOR!JANET STREET-PORTER: It may be a Rotten public image, but let’s salute King of Punk John Lydon for letting it all hang out – and sneering at the Instagram generationJANET STREET-PORTER: Rees-Mogg\u0027s nanny-botherer is a nasty piece of work but I\u0027ve still got more time for him than Serena pretending her tantrums are a political protest JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an unfortunate few minutes of television turned into a terrifying witch-hunt of one of the nicest women I knowJANET STREET-PORTER: If Harry, Meghan and Eugenie want to live it large like reality TV stars they\u0027d better have a Plan B... when the paying public has had enough JANET STREET-PORTER: Boris Johnson is a buffoon but if there\u0027s one thing we all need to agree on it\u0027s that our society is built on the absolute freedom to disagreeJANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become anti-social yobs, their parents must pay tooThe nanny-state panic over Britain’s heatwave makes my blood boil, says JANET STREET-PORTER. They know how to cope with the sun Down Under… so it’s time to send for the Aussies! JANET STREET-PORTER: If there was any evidence against Cliff he should have been tried in court, not on the BBC news by a hysterical reporter and a bunch of publicity hungry copsJANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises, two-faced Theresa and duplicitous Boris have tossed their green principles in the trashArriving at London’s Royal Academy on her first solo engagement, to open Oceania, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of the Pacific, Meghan stepped out of her limo - the door held open by a flunkey - then, turned around and closed it.Job done, she could get on with meeting a lineup of important people, delivering a short speech, and rubbing noses with a group of maori dancers and performers.Immediately, the Sun’s Royal Correspondent was congratulating the Duchess for showing she could still ‘take the time’ for these simple little tasks. Etiquette expert William Hanson offered up his take on door-gate, in case we hadn’t understood it’s importance - ‘it is usually done by others for security reasons’.I find that closing the car door is also a good idea if the weather is windy, in case it blows back on your leg, wrecking your £25 Wolford designer tights, or (worse) mows down a passing cyclist, who will start shouting obscenities.Meghan had clearly practised for this earth-shattering moment. Arriving at the launch of a charity cookbook in aid of the Grenfell survivors with her mother a few days earlier, she leapt out of the back seat and quickly shut the door.I’m sure security staff are already mulling over the implications of her impetuous actions - more of this kind of behaviour could result in staff redundancies.          The gesture generated praise for Meghan\u0027s humble attitude, but Janet Street-Porter is not convincedSadly, Meghan is not the trail-blazer we hoped - it has emerged that the Duchess of Cambridge has been shutting her own car door for some time, even whilst carrying Princess Charlotte in her arms back in 2016.Meghan might be trying to send a message that she’s the same simple girl, but as etiquette expert Mr Hanson reminds us ‘life is very different for Meghan now she’s joined The Firm -‘ no more selfies or autographs.No vote and no public social media’.Meghan says she’s a feminist who fights for women’s rights, but she signed away her chance to vote for our democracy. Maybe the chance to wear a procession of couture outfits costing thousands of pounds and live with a multi-millionaire made that bitter pill easier to swallow.          Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft, according to Janet Street-PorterAnd those four inch heels? They are not footwear women can fight in, they are unsteady and uncomfortable. A woman can wear what she chooses, but in Meghan’s position - cue the car door moment - everything she doessays and wears will be picked over.Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft. Meghan wants other women to feel comfortable and be themselves, not conform to hackneyed stereotypes, but she needs to lead by real example, not car door handle moments.She projects a very narrow, version of glamorous femininity, in complete contract to her mother, who seems much happier in her own skin and who has her own relaxed style.Fans gushed that the ‘door closing’ moment showed that Meghan was ‘humble’ and ‘down to earth’…’just like the rest of us’. According to the etiquette expert ‘she’s going to be doing things her way and helping to adapt and progress the British Monarchy’.As Private Eye would say, pass the sickbag. I find it’s easier to be modern when wearing a £2500 Givenchy dress and channelling Audrey Hepburn, although it’s not a look I plan to emulate on the London Underground any time soon.When it comes to Royal transport, Meghan is a fast learner, having made a mistake on her first public engagement with the Queen, by faffing about next to their car, and then asking Ma’am which side she fancied sitting on.Apparently the Queen ‘always sits behind the driver, although etiquette stipulates that the most senior person in a car should sit diagonally behind the chauffeur’.Just keep that pearl of wisdom in your mind, when you’re arguing about who gets the most leg room in the Uber home after a night out. And make sure you shut the door."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/22/15/4472740-0-image-m-10_1537628121278.jpg","title":"Benny beluga Whale watchers force Arctic giant swam 2 000 miles","story":"    A beluga whale breaches in the river Thames close to Gravesend, Kent,          Concerns were growing for a beluga whale spotted in the River Thames estuary  But despite initial fears the \u0027very lost\u0027 mammal\u0027s life could be in danger, the RSPCA  assured watchers Benny (left) has moved out towards the estuary, \u0027which is a good sign\u0027. Pictured right is a stock image of a beluga whaleNicknamed Benny, although its sex is unknown, the whale that popped up in the river this week is a rare treat for wildlife enthusiasts.There are 150,000 belugas, but they’re usually found near Greenland, Russia and North America.Yesterday, Benny had moved several miles upstream from where it was first spotted on Tuesday by ecologist Dave Andrews, on the other side of the river, by Coalhouse Fort in Essex. We watched in breathless silence as the whale breached one to three times every four minutes. We saw its ‘spiracle’, or breathing hole, on the back of its huge, bulbous ‘melonhead’ and the ridge along its 5ft back.Benny spent the morning feeding around three barges – belugas are partial to cod, octopus, squid and herring – while moving slowly down towards the estuary, towards freedom and the Arctic Circle.‘The whale can feel the cold, saline water of the incoming tide which it prefers to the warm, fresh water of the Thames,’ said Clare Dew, of the RSPCA.The whale doesn’t know where it is in relation to the North Pole, but with luck it will navigate home using temperature as a guide. For the moment, Benny seems safe enough – but must be lonely. Belugas are sociable creatures and travel in pods of ten or more. In summer, they gather in groups of hundreds or even thousands.

This is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world and on the Essex side lies the port of Tilbury.Exactly why Benny has strayed so far from home is a mystery, said Miss Dew. ‘It might have been in a small pod that was following a food source, but got thrown off course by Hurricane Florence.

I wanted to write it for grandparents everywhere – and the kids – so it gives you something to read to the grandkids at bed time.”Explaining the title, the former Beatle said: “I’ve got eight grandchildren and they’re all beautiful and one day one of them said to me “Hey Grandude!”. I said “What?” and I thought, I kind of like that, so from then on I was kind of known as Grandude.“So I thought, you know what, it’s actually a nice idea for a book, so I started to write some stories, and then I talked to the book publishers and they liked what I was doing.”The picture book is set to be illustrated by Kathryn Durst, who said she was “thrilled” to work on the project. “I have wonderful childhood memories of my dad taking my siblings and me on exciting adventures, just like Grandude does in the book. I am very excited to be able to work with Paul McCartney on this project. It has been such a treat to collaborate with such an inspiring and accomplished artist. We both want to make an exciting and beautiful book that kids will want to read again and again!”McCartney is just the latest in a line of musicians to mellow into children’s publishing, with fellow former Beatle Ringo Starr and Rolling Stone Keith Richards also having released picture books with varying degrees of success.McCartney has previously put his name to children’s books before: he teamed up with author Philip Ardagh and illustrator Geoff Dunbar in 2005 to produce the ecological picture book High in the Clouds, which followed a squirrel called Wirral and his attempts to win back his woodlands from developers.Hey Grandude will be published globally in September 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e76b5cedab96750c3b9df2b38f2c895f53863d7d/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad65f1a2c5bd86760681a18ae0dcf6f6","title":"brexit watch hang on to your hats experts debate data","story":"Two former members of Bank of England’s rate-setting committee give views on UK growth•How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy: September verdict•Growing disconnect between economic and political realitySenior economic adviser at accountancy group PwC and member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee (MPC) from 2006 to 2011There is a disconnect at the moment between the political process which is aimed at delivering Brexit and the latest economic news. On the political front, the government has produced a raft of papers on “no-deal” scenarios and the talks with the EU seem to have reached an impasse. But much of the economic news is reasonably positive.One explanation for this pattern is that UK consumers and businesses are resilient, and are not paying much attention to the latest political ups and downs. This would be quite rational, given that we have all been living with Brexit uncertainty for some time.On the other hand, this may be the lull before the storm. If Brexit negotiations do go badly, there could be a sharp downward correction in the UK economy in the first half of next year.The most likely scenario is that we are heading towards a Brexit deal, but it will say much more about the terms of separation from the EU than the future relationship with our European partners. In that case, businesses may well start to take some actions next year which reflect longer-term uncertainty about future trade and investment relationships with our EU partners.We may therefore be heading into a period of increased volatility, in which consumers, businesses and financial markets are continually changing their assessment in a rapidly shifting political environment. Things don’t look too bad now, but hold onto your hats as we move from autumn into winter. It could get choppy in the next few months.Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, and member of the Bank’s MPC from 2006 to 2009The big economic news on the month was that oil prices continued their inexorable rise, with Brent crude rising to more than $82 a barrel. A barrel of oil was under $60 as recently as October. Petrol prices and inflation are poised to rise as a result.Rising interest rates inevitably have a downward impact on mortgage costs and hence on house prices as the price of money rises. The latest data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows that sales volumes across the UK were the weakest for five months, while house price growth across Britain is slowing and the London market – which is the most exposed part of the property market to Brexit uncertainty – has slumped.The growing likelihood of failure for Theresa May’s Chequers plan represents significant downside risks to growth. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, rightly warned the cabinet of the risks to growth from a chaotic Brexit. The imposition of a three-day week by Jaguar Land Rover and the indications by BMW Mini that they will shutter their factories if a hard Brexit occurs are likely the tip of the iceberg.Brexit continues to represent the biggest downside risk to UK growth. Six months to go and counting and still the government has no credible Brexit plan. Sanity needs to prevail and soon. A no-deal Brexit would be a job and economic output killer.In addition, the outlook for world trade is sharply deteriorating as the US becomes more protectionist and imposes import tariffs on Chinese goods. The Chinese then retaliate and down we go. Rising protectionism is likely to make life difficult for the UK to negotiate trade deals outside the EU. Good news is still hard to find."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af8e2fcae6506000b0d20160baa92959390265b/0_52_3150_1891/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49427bd97b1f38f5b7ec6abdb14cd7c0","title":"wall street v high street goldman sachs launches 15 online saver","story":"US investment titan’s entrance into UK retail banking pressures British challenger banks to up their ratesThe launch of an online savings account by Goldman Sachs has raised hopes of higher returns for Britain’s long-suffering savers, putting pressure on other banks to up their savings rates.UK savers have seen returns dwindle in recent years as the Bank of England kept its base rate at record lows for almost a decade.

The first is that, three years into the Corbyn revolution, Labour has now been radically transformed into a party in the leader’s own far-left political image. The second is that Labour’s many factions, interest groups and traditions are nevertheless mostly managing to work together in a surprisingly pragmatic way.There was evidence for each of these claims in Corbyn’s speech. The left radicalism was there in the attacks on privatisation and outsourcing – the “racket” on which a Corbyn government would call time. It was there in the enormous list of uncosted government spending commitments, which covered housing, police, childcare, public sector pay, universal benefits for older people, and investment in transport and green energy. And it was there in the well-trailed section denouncing the political and economic elite (by implication New Labour as well as Conservative) that kept the banking system afloat after the financial crisis a decade ago.But the practical pluralism that allows Labour’s differing interest groups to all leave Liverpool in something like good order was there in the speech, too. Labour was a broad church, Corbyn acknowledged, invoking an idea that many thought had now gone. The party achieved nothing by being ided, he insisted. So it should not seek out ision. It had to draw a line – easier said than done, but said nevertheless – under the bitterness around antisemitism over the summer. Instead, Labour embodied “the new common sense of our time”. It was “the new majority”.These are mere phrases. Yet many observers of the Liverpool conference will recognise that they chimed with something real in a successful week for Labour. As Corbyn delivered his leader’s speech, the historian David Kogan was highlighting not just the unimaginable shift in Labour policy stances since the Blair-Brown era but also the spirit of give and take that ran through many of the proceedings, not least in the handling of Brexit and in the relationship between the trade unions and the Momentum-dominated grassroots on many policy and process issues, often behind the scenes. Labour is a volatile coalition but even Corbyn seems up for a bit of distinctly Blairite triangulation these days.The important thing to grasp about the Labour party of 2018 is that the two generalisations – Labour as left party and Labour as broad church – have not yet become incompatible. Corbyn’s speech juggled them rather effectively. If the party of today was the fully Corbynised body that some claim, there would be little room or appetite in it for habits of pragmatism, compromise or experimentation. Yet there is still that appetite.All this could change. But Labour’s leaders appear to have calculated that an all-out confrontation with sitting MPs over reselection, for example, is not in its interests. Fear of the formation of a new centre party is real. Its creation would prevent the election of a Corbyn government and leave its social democratic programme stillborn. Hence the relative ecumenism on show at Liverpool – with no big splits and almost none of the jeering of the early 80s. Hence the unions’ successful efforts to rein in some of Momentum’s demands on reselection. Hence the open-armed parts of Corbyn’s speech and the role of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, in pushing to widen their embrace.The reality, which has been obvious for some time but which was also powerfully apparent at Liverpool, is that Labour is a more complicated party than many of Corbyn’s supporters – and enemies – like to pretend. It is also worth pointing out that this has often been true in the past, too. Labour has never been all one thing or all another, even in the New Labour ascendancy. Two separate sessions on Tuesday on the conference floor embodied this dynamic complexity. In the first, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, electrified the conference by saying that “nobody is ruling out remain as an option”. The standing ovation that greeted the comment took even him by surprise. The issue dominated the news cycle and every nuance of Corbyn’s speech regarding Brexit was put under the microscope to see if it aligned. They did, sort of.In the same hall on Tuesday afternoon the delegate from Harlow, Colin Monehen, moved a motion on Palestine in a fiery speech. He, too, brought the hall to its feet. He, too, stirred prolonged cheering and chanting. All of a sudden there were more flags being waved in the Labour conference on Tuesday than they have in the Albert Hall on the Last Night of the Proms. It was hard to tell which was the larger outburst.The lazy thing to say is that the part of the conference that gave Starmer a standing ovation in the morning was the Labour right, while the part that waved the Palestinian flags was the left. There’s some truth in that, of course. Labour moderates are passionate pro-Europeans, while the Labour left has always seen Europe as the right’s issue. By the same token, the Palestinian cause has always been principally that of the left, while the Labour right has been more pro-Israeli.Yet my unscientific impression, sitting there, was that plenty of people in the Labour conference were equally roused by both issues. The support for each was spread wide and randomly within the hall. That’s hardly unreasonable or weird. You can be passionate about the case for Britain to stay in the European Union and also, in a logically connected part of the brain, be passionate about the need to oppose those on both sides who prevent a peaceful two-state solution in the Middle East. The direct impact of the conference on these two issues is, however, very unequal. Labour’s commitment to Palestine remains overwhelmingly rhetorical. Its practical ability to shape Brexit, on the other hand, has never been greater. Labour leaves Liverpool recommitted to a very soft Brexit indeed. It also leaves Liverpool as a party that is open to a general election or a second referendum and even, depending on circumstances, to a second vote in which remain, as Starmer said openly and Corbyn seemed to confirm, could be an option.All this is incredibly hard to forecast. Only a mug would try. But Corbyn’s recognition of his need to prevent a Labour split has meant that he has allowed a space for the European cause to advance far further up his agenda for government than he might have preferred. Is Labour now capable of solving the European question? That is a stretch. In Liverpool, though, it felt as if a future Labour pitch to combine a £350m pledge to the NHS with a pledge to stay in the EU – not to leave it – is now an almost imaginable combination. It is a strange thought, but it may have fallen to Corbyn to save the country.• Martin Kettle is a  associate editor and columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be350442aeb603647dc3f18df6c5025e83e1d0af/0_10_4104_2463/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83e88188102ad5ceef9e1c38e333e16","title":"reinvent europe reclaim promise heal divisions","story":"In 1918, Europe emerged devastated from a bloody war that left its isions unhealed. In 1939, conflict broke out afresh, its roots in fascism and an economic crisis. It took decades of sustained effort and compromise for a new generation to finally offer Europeans what the leaders who had sleepwalked into two wars had denied them: a Europe of peace, prosperity and solidarity.A century on, as our continent once again faces ision and stagnation, we refuse to be a new generation of sleepwalkers. We must act now, or the European project will stall. Worse, it could be suffocated by nationalist and populist forces for whom the EU represents a historical anomaly that must be undone.With eight months to go to European parliament elections in which the citizens of 27 countries will choose the Europe they want, we are launching an appeal: let’s reinvent Europe, to finally meet the expectations of its citizens and reclaim the original European promise.Europe at the moment seems too often overwhelmed by challenges: ecological, economic or those linked to migration. It is overwhelmed by citizens’ expectations for less regulation and more action. It is overwhelmed by commitments that it can no longer keep because it lacks a common vision and effectiveness in its functioning.Still, the European promise is not lost it is just slumbering. Recent progress on the rules governing workers posted abroad and defence show that Europe makes progress when the political will rallies Europeans around a clear and ambitious project. And when it comes to taxation of the digital economy, we have only begun, but we know that a Europe-wide solution is the only way. President Macron’s Sorbonne speech embodies this ambition: it is now up to us to make it a reality.It is not simply a question of overcoming the isions that have led to the present impasse. Nor is it a question of continually reminding people that the Orbáns, Le Pens and Salvinis of Europe have nothing to offer beyond blaming the EU for all their evils. We must offer solutions.That is why our plan to reinvent Europe is clear:Instead of engaging with such threats as the “mass cleansing” spoken of by Matteo Salvini in Italy, “getting rid of Islam” by the AfD in Germany, or “ending Europe” by Marine Le Pen, we proudly proclaim the founding values of peace, freedom, prosperity and solidarity.Instead of supporting calls to muzzle the justice system and political opposition, we demand strict respect for the rule of law and for democratic institutions.Rather than accepting a ided and weakened continent at the mercy of the world’s other great powers, we are calling for a sovereign Europe capable of acting forcefully in areas where inidual member states are powerless, in economic and monetary policy, security and defence, environment and agriculture, social policy, immigration and integration and digital change.That is also why our method is clear: in our determination to reinvent Europe, nothing is ruled out. We are ready to reform the EU treaties if necessary. We are determined to move forward in spite of the obstacles, recognising that each country must move forward at its own pace. We want a stronger Europe and we will stay open to those who want to join us along the way.We are determined to go beyond existing partisan structures if they act as obstacles. We are committed to reinventing Europe together with men and women who lead their countries, from the north and the south, the west and the east, who are passionate about Europe, and determined to invest in this historic project while others are content to recite incantations or play walk-on parts.We now have eight months to convince the citizens of our own countries that Europe deserves this new project and that the citizens deserve this new Europe. Time is running out: we have eight months to get Europe to wake up.• Christophe Castaner is president of La République En Marche!

Of course the overwhelmingly Tory press, owned by a handful of zillionaires, hates everything he stands for. Of course they slam him all over the place – especially for promising to implement David Cameron’s Leveson 2 to give citizens legal protection from the media’s worst intrusions.But see how almost every rightwing editorial and commentator warns the Tories that Labour has the high ground in ideas, dynamism and popular appeal. Corbynism is shifting the ground beneath the Tories’ feet and they sound knee-knocking scared.First, here’s the ritual punch-bagging. The ’s leader writhes furiously: “Entrepreneurs would leave the country or close down their businesses and put thousands out of work … Yes, everyone will be equal, equally poor. We know this because wherever Mr Corbyn’s brand of socialism has been tried, calamity has been the result. Look at Venezuela …” Corbyn would threaten the fundamentals of liberal democracy itself, says Theresa May’s former adviser Nick Timothy in the same paper, ending ominously: “We cannot say we have not been warned.”“Labour would ruin us all” is the Express’s editorial headline. The Mail’s leader says, “As any realist can see, his programme of Marxist economics, class warfare and unfettered union power is a recipe for mass unemployment and national ruin.” The Times leader agrees: “Judged by any reasonable outsider it was not a prospectus for government but for economic disaster.”There’s plenty more of this, with gleeful reporting of red meat outre conference moments – MP Laura Smith’s call for a general strike against democracy, cheered on by the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler’s batty praise for the days of Liverpool’s Militant regime, and so on. So much, so routine.But read beyond the headlines and every one of these rightwing leader-writers says the same thing: Tories, beware! This Corbyn stuff is political magic that may fool the unwary voter. Here’s the Mail: “It is simply not enough for Tories to point out the truth that Mr Corbyn’s policies are disastrous or that he’s surrounded by antisemites and sympathisers with anti-western terrorists … No, at their conference next week the Tories need to set out their own solutions to the grievances Mr Corbyn has identified. They must find positive language to convince the country that under them the future for all will be bright. After this week’s display of far-left lunacy in Liverpool, the stakes couldn’t be higher.”The FT’s Sebastian Payne writes: “Only a new economic agenda can save the Conservatives.” The Times leader ends, “In the battle for ideas between the two main parties, the quality is low but Mr Corbyn is right that he is winning … It should not be hard to make a case for grown-up government, Mrs May is just making it look much harder.” Their stablemate The Sun warns the same: “If the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.” The  leader warns that Corbyn’s speech ended on “a triumphalist note that the Tories urgently need to silence with a plan of their own.”The message loud and clear is that May’s government is running on empty, Brexit has sucked the air out everything, and it is as short of inspiration as John Major’s comical conference speech where his response to crashing out of the ERM was a motorway cones hotline. These Tory commentators can all feel the seismic quake of the centre ground lurching away from Margaret Thatcher’s certainty that lower taxes and a smaller state is where elections are won. They are blindsided by finding her policies rejected because they have failed.The ideological icons of her era have tumbled down, of their own accord. Renationalising the utilities she snatched from public ownership has the backing of a public scandalised by their privatised boards’ behaviour. Her “Tell Sid” share-owning democracy never happened, but Corbyn’s might. Her right-to-buy sold off huge numbers of council homes, many of which are now owned by rack-renting landlords charging inflated rents – and the bill is picked up by the taxpayer through housing benefit, amid a housing crisis. Home ownership has fallen not risen. What on earth can they find – fast – to replace their lost faith?But something else is also at work today, not a noble search for new directions but a familiar dig at their own hated leader. They use Corbyn’s cornucopia of new thinking as a stick to beat May in their continuing fratricidal internal warfare over Brexit. Quentin Letts’ long leader-page piece says it all. Once he has ritually knocked Labour about a bit, he warns they might win – and May is to blame. But the lesson he wants his party to learn is to double down on all the policies the public is moving away from. “Imagine if the Tories started speaking of liberty, of tax-cutting, of proper defence spending, of cutting the foreign aid budget by two-thirds and getting us cleanly out of the EU, no strings, no caveats. And imagine if they did it with a sense of joy. Impossible under Theresa May? If so, find someone more charismatic.”Well, bring it on. If the only lesson they can learn is that the country is in need of more of the same, Labour will have a clear run whenever the next election comes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac69d98ff11ba2061d6c1eb83691a0e0cfc01823/0_7_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd04488424111cad7f58abffef5c1bc","title":"uks first air filtering bus launches in southampton","story":"Bus will clean up air pollution as it drives around the city, using a filtration system on the roofOne of the UK’s largest bus and rail operators has launched the country’s first air filtering bus in an effort to tackle air pollution.The Go-Ahead Group unveiled the Bluestar bus in Southampton on Thursday claiming that the new filtration system attached to the top of the vehicle will clean the air as it moves around the city.Go Ahead chief executive, David Brown said: “We are going a step further in the potential for our buses to actively clean the environment. It’s a huge development in our environmental leadership and we are also proud to be pioneering the prototype in the UK.”The diesel bus is fitted with a specially designed filter that its inventors say will remove ultra-fine particles from the air and trap them as the bus moves through the streets. The filter then allows the bus to blow out more pure air so that the air behind it is cleaner than that in front of it.Brown said Southampton had been chosen for the prototype as the World Health Organization revealed that the city is at its limit of unsafe air pollution. It is also one of five cities tasked with drawing up air pollution plans by the government. Brown said that if the trial is successful it could be rolled out to Go Ahead’s entire fleet of more than 5,000 buses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b4897cf4756bcbd75d7694fbddb444ce04d6a0/0_356_4423_2654/master/4423.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee6aca8b54937e523f1482aeb6dd4b5","title":"eye on the tiger the worlds largest ever exhibition of tiger photography in pictures","story":"London show brings together powerful and moving images from the world’s top wildlife photographers to raise awareness of the plight of these critically endangered cats"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6b2400b2e43d93311ad541c0969956fa23d99c2/0_210_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=754fd793550fc5ec03b3b1c3946d6da7","title":"how to avoid food waste top chefs on their grandparents favourite dishes and what they taught them","story":"Angela Hartnett, Fergus Henderson, Raymond Blanc and many others describe the frugal simplicity - and delicious flavours - that inspire their cooking todayYet among many chefs and campaigning food writers, the sense persists that on a number of issues – particularly food waste, but also obesity, nutrition, cost, pleasure even – there is much to admire in how our grandparents ate. In an era of limited choice and tight budgets, they made a virtue of the necessity to cook with whatever fresh ingredients were available. “My grandparents didn’t cook ‘sustainably’, but they did cook every day, one of life’s best skills, and they didn’t throw leftovers away. To that extent, they were thrifty,” says Tom Hunt, the self-styled eco-chef and  columnist.To examine that idea, we asked a number of top chefs to choose a meal that encapsulates how their grandparents cooked and to explain how, in its frugal simplicity, it still influences them. Call it going back to the future.“Originally from Bardi in Italy, my grandmother never wasted a thing in the kitchen. It was incredible. Any leftovers went into bowls covered with a saucer she didn’t believe in clingfilm. For her minestrone, she’d use bones from a roast to make stock and any old veg, dried beans and parmesan rinds would go in. These days, people look at sell-by dates and bin stuff when there’s no need. I freeze anything I can re-use and then I’ll invite the neighbours over for a freezer-party.”Liver and onions“I’m 48. As a kid in Bury, offal was commonplace. I loved watching my gran make flash-fried liver with onion gravy and mashed potato. It’s a 20-minute meal. Faggots, made of minced heart, liver and lung, were a school dinner favourite. I’d eat whatever was put on the table. If you didn’t, there was nothing else. Today, I know friends who’ll cook three different meals for three different kids. It’s crazy.”“I was six when I started helping my gran in the kitchen. It was just expected that us girls would cook. At weekends, we’d help out in the Sikh temple kitchens feeding the community and – using this big burner at my dad’s in Chapeltown – we’d cook huge batch curries and daals. Daal is such a heart-warming dish: simple, cheap, beautiful. We’d give this food to friends or use it for family weddings. This was before people used caterers. We’d chop hundreds of onions, but there was no waste. Any spare vegetables or lemon and lime skins we’d pickle or make into chutney, and that’s how I run my kitchen.”“I grew up in the Franche-Comté, in a village between Burgundy and the Jura mountains. Money was tight, but my grandmother was an extraordinary cook who passed that knowledge on to my mum, who taught me to do a lot with very little. She always used seasonal vegetables from our garden or the forest, where we foraged for berries, mushrooms and wild asparagus. My mother had five children and used a lot of pulses and cheese – meat was a special treat. A simple, cheesy comté soufflé was a staple on our table. It encapsulates my region.”“My dad’s mum had a roadside cafe in Ingleton called the Three Peaks and what struck me about Nana was that she never used recipes. It was all instinct. Both her and my mum used whatever they had in, cooking sustainably without being aware of it. My mum makes an amazing cottage pie using, as she says, ‘everything from the top shelf’. It’s the same base, but she adds whatever she has in the fridge. With one-pots and cottage pies you can play around, substituting ingredients so nothing is wasted.”“I fondly remember picking fruit with my gran, Minnie, in her garden in Sheffield: wild strawberries, jewel-like currants, raspberries, hedgerow blackberries. She’d make jam or use the leftovers for cordial – my gran was naturally thrifty – but the most fragrant fruit would be reserved for summer pudding. Put the fruit in a pan with some sugar and the odd tart gooseberry and it yields this beautiful glossy purple juice. Soak up the juice with some slightly stale bread and layer that up with fruit in a pudding basin. Serve with double cream.”Chicken and rice“My gran, Mamita Naty, lived in a small Andean village, 18 hours by bus from Lima. She was a farmer and a cook whose house doubled as a restaurant. In the Andes, the food tradition is farm-to-table, nose-to-tail, organic, zero waste. It’s not a fad. It’s been that way for hundreds of years and, in my restaurants, we’re very resourceful. Take the Peruvian classic arroz con pollo, which is like coriander chicken paella. We get the whole chicken and use the offal in a separate devilled, stir-fried dish, we use the meat for the main and then we cook the carcass with leftover pea pods, herb stems, pepper and onion ends to make an exquisite broth. In a way, that chicken and rice turns into three dishes.”“In the 90s, we’d visit my elderly uncle and auntie Nishimura in Kyoto each summer. There were no snacks or packaged drinks in the house and we always took packed lunches on day trips. It’s just what people of their generation did. An evening meal would be broth, rice, a small piece of fish or cold octopus, home-fermented tsukemono pickles and maybe cooked vegetables. Giant frozen grapes were a big treat for dessert. Any leftovers would go into uncle’s lunch next day, made into onigiri rice balls or a bento. I take a similar approach at the Black Bull. We buy in whole animals and use everything.”“The second world war and rationing killed food culture for my grandparents’ generation. But they could cook. There was less processed, convenience food and you had to produce meals from real ingredients. My grandmother wasn’t a great cook, but she used to make a thickened white chicken stew – I don’t know if she knew the fancy French name for it, but like a blanquette de poulet – and I still totally love simple, comforting one-pot stews.”Bacon ribs and cabbageTripe and onions“I don’t really have culinary memories of my granny, who died when I was young, but my mum, who was born in Bolton, used to cook us tripe and onions in milk with mashed potato. It’s a wonderfully calming dish that uplifts the spirits. Bleached tripe was widely available in London in the 60s and 70s, but we use brown, unbleached tripe in the restaurant. We pickle it or slow-braise it. A few boys still come in and ask: ‘What’s the scariest thing on the menu?’, which is all wrong. Offal is not scary. It’s delicious.”“I don’t want to use the word ‘foraging’, but in the early 90s, in my grandparents’ village outside York, it was normal to walk the dogs whilst gathering mushrooms for Sunday lunch or brambles for a pie. We ate a lot of game, too – whatever was at hand in that rural area. As many people in Yorkshire do, we’d eat our Yorkshire pudding and gravy first, as a starter. Historically, it was a ‘filler’ and, by eating that way, people could reduce the cost of a three-course meal. That upbringing made me appreciate you can create restaurant dishes and extract deliciousness from humble ingredients. It doesn’t have to be all fillet of beef and caviar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79dbd28c374b3fc36df86bd8302d4f27eda2aa9a/0_214_3230_1938/master/3230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363ba60cbd5e7d041c2eb095e1f1096b","title":"gareth southgate new contract england manager 2022","story":"• Proposal to go before FA board on Thursday• Southgate offered significant pay riseGareth Southgate is set to agree a new four-year contract on improved terms to stay as England’s manager to the end of the 2022 World Cup finals in Qatar.The proposed deal will be put before the Football Association’s board on Thursday and, with the national side having achieved a fourth-place finish in Russia in the summer, is likely to be ratified without any issues.Southgate had been relaxed about his contract situation – his deal is due to expire after the 2020 European Championship – and although he has made no secret of his desire to return to club management at some stage he is expected to sign the new terms.The FA has moved swiftly after losing its technical director, Dan Ashworth, who has worked closely with Southgate at St George’s Park over the latter’s two-year tenure, to Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion. Ashworth tendered his resignation day and will take up his new position early next year.With that in mind, the governing body has moved to secure Southgate on terms that would increase his basic annual pay, believed to be around £1.8m, to nearer £3m. The assistant manager, Steve Holland, is expected to join him by securing new terms.England’s Nations League campaign began this month with a defeat by Spain, and they face difficult trips to Croatia and Spain in October, by which point the FA will hope to have its manager under new contract.Southgate’s presence beyond 2020 would maintain continuity while a group of talented young players, who have made their mark in the England junior teams, potentially progress to the senior set-up. The FA has long targeted the 2022 World Cup as a tournament when its brightest young prospects will be at their peak.Ashworth will give the FA input over his successor as technical director as he works out his notice period. “Do I think we’re capable of winning something in the next two, four, six or eight years?” Ashworth said. “I certainly believe we have the talent in coaches, players and staff in place, yes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60388787917dfd116967b57fd2b82df2c740a8fe/0_99_4380_2628/master/4380.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4f683aa3bcdff578998ab70746f2577","title":"maurizio sarri chelsea liverpool ngolo kante midfield jorginho","story":"Press against press, 4-3-3 against 4-3-3, wide forwards who cut in against wide forwards who cut in, attacking full-back against attacking full-back: Chelsea against Liverpool on Saturday, Maurizio Sarri against Jürgen Klopp, will be a meeting of two very similar conceptions of football. Wednesday night’s Carabao Cup meeting, even with significantly altered line-ups, highlighted those similarities, and also the fact that the main difference lies in midfield. Chelsea may have won at Anfield, but it is in the centre that Liverpool perhaps have an edge.The speed with which Chelsea have adapted to Sarri’s approach has been remarkable but one area that seems not quite yet to work is the role of N’Golo Kanté. Jorginho was Napoli’s metronome last season, creating the play and setting the tempo. There were doubts about whether he would be able to function in a similar way amid the harum-scarum of a Premier League midfield but he already looks at home, and has broken the Premier League record for most passes in a game. Whether those passes are necessarily always purposeful is another issue.More concerning, though, is what the Italian’s introduction as a regista in a 4-3-3 means for Kanté. The 27-year-old is a player of such prodigious stamina that he briefly made Danny Drinkwater look like some kind of English Pirlo by seeming simultaneously to operate both to his left and his right. That capacity to perform two roles at once is rather less useful, though, when the positions he is occupying make him less an all-over fire blanket than some awkward blend of box-to-box midfielder and inside-right.Kanté’s tackles, meanwhile, are more than a third down on either of his previous seasons at Chelsea, while his interceptions have plummeted by a factor of 2.5. Such details can be misleading, particularly when there has been a change of coach and style of a side, but that does not alter the general sense that Kanté is being asked to fulfil a function that does not necessarily get the best out of him.A solution could be for Kanté to drop deeper, more alongside Jorginho, operating as a bodyguard for him as he did for Drinkwater, but that would require a change of shape to something more akin to a 4-2-3-1. That, though, doesn’t necessarily get the best out of Mateo Kovacic, who has himself scored only one league goal in the last three and a half years, would restrict Jorginho’s passing options and would require Sarri to revert to a shape he hasn’t used since he was at Sorrento in Lega Pro 1 in 2011-12. Sarri’s problem, essentially, is that he doesn’t have anybody who can fulfil the role Marek Hamsik did for Napoli, offering goals and creativity from midfield.Wednesday’s game went through three distinct phases. There was the first half of the first half, in which Liverpool’s press struggled to stifle Chelsea and Cesc Fàbregas, a player who is perhaps capable of playing that Hamsik role, had a significant influence. There was the middle portion – the second and third quarters of the match – in which Liverpool got on top of Fàbregas, were able to dominate and had enough chances to have finished the tie. And then there was the end of the second half, when Eden Hazard, having come off the bench, began to exert his influence and Liverpool allowed themselves to be rattled by the decision to award the free-kick that led to the equaliser.With the first-choice midfield – presumably Jordan Henderson and James Milner, who both played only part of Wednesday’s game, and Georginio Wijnaldum, who was rested altogether – Liverpool’s press should be more efficient. At least as significant a factor, though, is likely to be on the flanks, with the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson at full-back. Chelsea’s threat through the centre, after all, is minimal. Of their 17 goals in all competitions this season, only three have been scored by players who play through the middle (and one of those was a penalty) similarly, only three assists have been registered by players operating in central areas.Liverpool, it’s true, also threaten more from their wide forwards than through the middle, but the danger they pose through the centre is far greater: Daniel Sturridge and Roberto Firmino alone have scored six goals between them this season. When Sarri speaks of being a year behind Liverpool in terms of development, whatever questions may be asked about the timeframe, that surely is one of the prime issues he is talking about.Stopping Hazard in the sort of form he is never going to be easy, but at least Liverpool can be fairly certain where the danger is coming from."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a295125e6f1afe6e4e547fbe5d945a68d56f6ca/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cd2d8d98bfad386143e6392637729e5","title":"from the human eye to hubble a brief history of our quest for better vision","story":"Technology today enables us to ‘look’ millions of light years across the universe, but up until 400 years ago we didn’t even have telescopes. The scientific search for ways to improve our sense of sight is truly inspiringPretty much as soon as humans stopped battling to stay alive 24 hours a day, the first thing they did was look up into the sky and wonder about the sun. The earliest religions made the sun into a god. In August, Nasa launched its Parker Solar Probe to take a closer look. And if you want to define what it is to be human – and to explain how we got from baffled apes to space explorers – it’s pretty much all in there. We want to take a look.In psychology, this is called the drive theory of curiosity. It defines curiosity as an internal drive that’s as important to us as hunger or thirst. It’s a naturally occurring urge that has to be satisfied. So, when we’d done inventing fire and shelter and took a look at our five senses, it’s only natural that we’d work on technology to improve sight above all the others. We’re always trying to find new ways of taking a better look.One of the first recorded mentions of improved eyesight was around 400BC – a tossed aside joke in a play called The Clouds by Aristophanes. It’s a comedy, and jokes only work if the audience shares the reference, so using a glass globe filled with water to magnify letters was commonplace enough to get a laugh in ancient Greece.It was almost 1,500 years before the Arab mathematician and astronomer Abu Ali al-Hassan Ibn al-Haitham published the first book on geometrical optics – showing how oval glass could magnify objects. The Venetians used his theories to make “reading stones” and the first European eyeglasses essentially bolted two reading stones together with a hinge around 1300AD. At which point we could finally – in theory – help everyone to see.But we’re human. Once we can see something, we want to see more. It took another few hundred years and some squabbling Dutchmen in the town of Middleburg to exploit nature’s laws and allow us to see things we were never designed to see. These days, Middelburg is a small, quiet town of some 50,000 inhabitants. At the turn of the 16th century, it was the Silicon Valley of improved vision – Hans Lippershey filed the first ever patent for a telescope there in 1608, while his next-door neighbour Zacharias Janssen claimed the first microscope around the same time. Lippershey then claimed the microscope himself proving we’ve never been able to keep our eyes on our own work.Since then sight tech has fell into two camps – improving our vision and augmenting our vision. From the 1800s people had been working on contact lenses with limited success. It wasn’t until 1936 that Brooklyn born optometrist William Feinbloom worked out that plastic, not glass, was the key to contacts.It was a shower of broken glass in a myopic boy’s eye – who found his sight improved after the wounds healed – that helped the Soviet scientist Svyatoslov Fyodorov develop radial keratotomy – eye surgery – to tweak the shape of the cornea and cure the short sighted, eventually developing laser eye surgery.Today there’s retinal implants – attached to the retina that trigger the optic nerve corneal inlays – small, ring-like devices implanted under the eye’s outer surface to correct both near and far-sightedness and augmented reality glasses such as those developed by Stephen Hicks, research fellow in neuroscience at the University of Oxford and founder of start-up OxSight.The company’s lenses overcome tunnel vision and glaucoma, using image-interpretation algorithms and cameras to increase image contrast, highlight specific visual features or create representations of reality on the lenses, according to Hicks – who raised £2m from angel investor Jiangong Zhang in 2016 and plans a launch later this year. The EU’s Retina project, meanwhile, aims to combine synthetic vision with images beamed directly on to the retina to help air traffic controllers see air traffic far beyond normal human perception, even in low-visibility conditions.And here’s where augmentation really kicks in. From the moment we could see the small stuff and the far away stuff we’ve wanted to see smaller and farther. As time progressed, the telescope was improved, notably by Sir Isaac Newton and Léon Foucault, but it wasn’t until the 1930s that we realised we could “see” without using our eyes – or even light. First up, the infrared – or thermographic – camera, developed in the UK by Hungarian physicist Kálmán Tihanyi to spot night-time air raids. It’s the same technology – albeit spruced up a little – that’s deployed as Night Vision in the new Volkswagen Touareg. This infrared camera spots pedestrians, cyclists and larger wild animals at a range of 10 to 130 metres and alerts the driver.The 1930s also saw Robert Watson-Watt deploy the first radiolocation technology – later known as radar – to help the UK’s Met Office track thunderstorms. Also at that time, Bell Labs engineer Karl Jansky discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions, inspiring the radio telescope that could observe everything from gamma-ray to infrared radiation. German physicist Hans Busch pioneered the study of electron opticsthroughout the decade, which led to Ernst Ruska inventing the electron microscope.With this tech, we no longer had to be in eye contact with our visual aids now, we even bury microscopes underground – like the particle accelerators at Cern that hurl particles into each other and analyse the results of the collisions to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter. Or we throw observing tech into space – such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Fermi’s Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. In April, Nasa launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite – or the Tess probe – to look for planets outside our solar system, using lenses and cameras that might blow Lippershey’s mind, but which he’d completely understand.And if we didn’t have to be there, couldn’t something else do the actual looking for us? In the 1960s, computer scientists took inspiration from the Perceptron machine developed by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt to pioneer artificial neural networks and work started on designing robots that could see. Indeed, one major goal of artificial intelligence at the time was to recreate the human visual system.This was, at best, a partial success – it gave us 3D modelling and digital-image processing, but it wasn’t until the 1990s that computers could handle the vast data sets involved in understanding and modelling real-time images. It’s worth pausing to realise how amazing your eye is – when a Google AI learned to identify cat faces in YouTube videos they needed 16,000 computers working together. You picked that up before you could talk.Things have improved for our mechanical friends – in 2016, UK based AI pioneers DeepMind began data-crunching retinal scans at Moorfields eye hospital in London after Pearse Keane, a consultant ophthalmologist, asked if it could help with a knotty NHS problem.There are currently more than 600,000 people with age-related macular degeneration – it creates shadowy areas in the central part of vision – in the UK and 200 people are diagnosed with the condition every day. Over the past 10 years, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionised diagnosis. This uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of the retina. A number of UK opticians already offer OCT scans on the high street but, according to Keane, “they don’t always have the necessary training to read the scans. The NHS is currently getting false positives from high street OCT scans asking us to see the patient urgently. Imagine every GP having an MRI but not being trained to use it.” DeepMind’s AI algorithm helps by checking scans for a telltale sign of the condition, sending an alert to a doctor if it finds one.Autonomous vehicle machine vision uses a similar technique – known as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, which ides images up into tiny pixels and essentially spots the difference in light intensity on different pixels. It’s not quite the system deployed by Knight Industries Two Thousand car Kitt in the 1982 TV series Knight Rider – although David Hasselhoff’s ride did sport collision-avoidance technology that inspired many of today’s vehicle collision safety features.Kitt had one feature we’ve never managed to reproduce in the real world – enough personality to understand the Hoff’s emotional needs. It urged him to trust his instincts or played wingman as he chatted up the ladies. In other words, it could look into his heart and his soul. Perhaps that’s somewhere we’d prefer to look into all by ourselves. There are some adventures where we don’t need better technology – we just need to be more human."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d999dfd766446433870f37220a5a089dd992df/0_232_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2d7b9ba68c14d872ecae532fc93dee 880w","title":"chair of australian public broadcaster abc resigns meddling claims","story":"Justin Milne allegedly asked ABC boss to sack journalist disliked by governmentThe chairman of Australia’s public broadcaster has resigned after allegations that he compromised its independence by calling for the removal of a senior journalist because of pressure from the government.Amid outrage from staff at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Justin Milne stood down on Tuesday, saying the “interests of the ABC have always been utmost in my mind”. He denied there had been any interference by the government in the ABC.His resignation came four days after he sacked the ABC’s first female managing director, Michelle Guthrie, halfway through her five-year term, a move she said had left her “devastated”.The sacking led to an inquiry into Milne’s actions and enormous public pressure, including from the broadcaster’s employees, who are understood to have been considering industrial action had the chairman remained in his job.It was alleged that Milne had called on Guthrie to fire the chief economics correspondent, Emma Alberici, who had been critical of the government, and the political editor, Andrew Probyn.After an emergency board meeting held without Milne, the ABC board thanked him for his “experienced leadership” and said it was “grateful for his willingness to put the ABC first in coming to his decision to resign.”Milne said the Alberici email, first published by Fairfax, had to be explained in context. “When there is an issue of editorial independence and accuracy, it’s appropriate for the chair to be involved – it’s the chair’s job,” he told the ABC’s 7.30 programme. “I have never sent an email to Michelle Guthrie, or anybody else, which says you must sack Emma Alberici or Andrew Probyn or anybody else.”Milne said his resignation did not signal that he had failed to uphold the editorial independence of the ABC and he denied anyone from the government had ever tried to influence him.The events have raised serious questions about the independence of the ABC board and its politicisation. Ministers have made direct appointments in recent years ignoring the recommendations of an independent panel. Hours before Milne’s resignation, the communications minister, Mitch Fifield, indicated that Milne no longer had the support of the government.Fifield said it had been a difficult week for the ABC and he reiterated the government’s commitment to the independence of the broadcaster. He said neither he nor the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull had ever asked for a reporter to be sacked. Australia revealed that Milne regularly spoke to ABC executives, including the news director, Gaven Morris, about contentious stories or content he didn’t approve of and referred to Guthrie as “the missus”.A close friend of Turnbull, Milne behaved more like a managing director than a chairman, sources said, and had strong views about the ABC’s reporting and programming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1630aefd70931086e4bc27f3972915f1658ead/0_0_1860_1116/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc177da2be018cd81d2895f05e002f5","title":"new owners of tribune shrug off criticism of former staffers","story":"New owners of leftwing publication, relaunched this week, reject accusations of asset-strippingThe new owners of the leftwing magazine Tribune have said their business model can give the magazine a sustainable future after decades of turmoil, despite criticism from former staff members who accused them of being asset-strippers.The magazine – once edited by the likes of Paul Foot and Aneurin Bevan – was revived this week with a high-profile launch at the Labour conference, having been taken over by the US publication Jacobin.The relaunched edition already has 2,000 subscribers and the owners are aiming to hit 10,000 within the next 12 months, with a focus on driving subscribers to the magazine’s bimonthly print publication, which has a focus on high-quality design, rather than trying to survive as an ad-funded online publication.“We’re looking to build an institution,” said the editor, Ronan Burtenshaw. “There was a load of discussion on the left with new media that you start online, build a big profile, and make the money with advertising. Where do you get your revenue and enough money to sustain yourself as an institution?”However, three of the four staff who were involved in the most recent version of Tribune – which ceased printing in January after a turbulent financial period which saw its profile sink – have now written public letters complaining that they have not been included in the new launch.“So often on the left, principles of comradeship, solidarity, honesty and so on make fine rhetoric but are shamelessly abandoned when they become inconvenient,” said former staffer Mike Parker, who said he was now unemployed. “It’s just as well that my capacity for disappointment in so-called ‘democratic socialists’ has not yet reached its limit.”Ian Hernon, the former deputy editor, was equally uncompromising: “In the capitalist world someone who buys an ailing company and dumps its committed workers is known as an asset-stripper or robber baron, but at least they don’t claim to be socialists.”Tribune had been struggling for years, ending up in the ownership of Owen Oyston – a convicted rapist and owner of Blackpool football club. The publication had debts of over £300,000, with the situation worsened by an unreliable subscriber list, non-functioning social media accounts, and a website that was covered in security notices.“We let them know that the model they were operating Tribune under couldn’t work any more,” said Burtenshaw, the only full-time employee of the new publication. “Their proposal to us was that we should come in as proprietors of an organisation with the same staffing, the model, the same operations which had driven Tribune to the point where the choice was closure or new management.”“Tribune was non-functional it was dead,” he said.The publication currently has no formal link to the Tribune Group of Labour MPs, although that group’s chair Clive Efford said he would be interested in working with the magazine – despite the confusion causing attendees at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool to approach him about subscriptions to the magazine.The proposed model is similar to Jacobin, which was started in 2011 by publisher Bhaskar Sunkara when he was a university student and pre-empted the rise of socialist US politicians such as Bernie Sanders. He said Jacobin has a budget of around $1.5m (£1.14m) a year – with roughly $1.3m coming from subscriptions, $100,000 from advertising, and $100,000 from donations.“Print is a static object, it’s something that you want to put on your coffee table, you want to give it to your friends,” said Sunkara, explaining his commitment to the format, claiming that Tribune had already sold several dozen lifetime subscriptions at £250 each and needed to sell around 7,000 copies to break even.Although the magazine’s first edition mainly features comment and historical pieces, the editors hope to expand into a limited amount of investigative reporting if budgets allow.“People are going to subscribe for moral and political reasons,” added Sunkara. “You’re getting something tangible and you know when you miss an issue. Would you know if you miss an issue of the New Statesman? It comes every week, the covers look similar.

It will shortly be sharing space on record shop shelves with The Chic Organisation 1977-79, a lavish box set containing the band’s first three albums alongside a collection of rarities, a facsimile of a promotional 12-inch and We Are Family, the 1979 Sister Sledge album that may well be the greatest Chic production of all. It comes complete with not one, not two, but three essays by prominent cultural critics on Chic’s significance.It was all noticeably different last time Chic released an album. In 1992, no one was in a rush to lavishly repackage their records or write scholarly essays on their importance. A critic who suggested they were one of the greatest bands of their era would have been going out on a limb. Their back catalogue was treated in the way you might expect a record label to treat the oeuvre of a band who hadn’t had a hit for 10 years: the nearest they came to an archival release was Megachic, a tacky medley of their hits apparently aimed squarely at the kind of person who enjoyed nothing more than donning an afro wig and demanding the DJ at the local 70s night play Rasputin by Boney M.Something dramatic has happened to Chic’s reputation in the intervening decades. Quite rightly so, but you do wonder whether the elevation of their 70s back catalogue from remnant of the disco era to vast cultural importance has impacted on Nile Rodgers’ ability to make new music: it’s a tough call to add to a legacy that’s thought of in such lofty terms. Certainly, the length of gestation of the 10 songs here – including two versions of recent single Sober and a Lady Gaga-helmed remake of 1979’s I Want Your Love, originally commissioned for a Tom Ford fashion show – suggests a lot of deliberating about how it should sound: a new Chic album was announced over four years before It’s About Time’s final appearance.You can appreciate Rodgers’ desire to make a modern pop record rather than something knowingly retro. He’s spent the noughties on a never-ending, hit-packed tour: perhaps few things instil a desire for contemporaneity quite like spending 15 years playing a set largely comprised of songs from the 1970s, no matter how wonderful those songs are. But it puts him in the thankless position of attempting to update a timeless sound, with the aid of a curious supporting cast including pop singer and Pitch Perfect 2 actor Hailee Steinfeld, PC Music producer Danny L Harle, and Craig David. The results are often pretty brash and shrill: Auto-Tuned vocals quantised, lockstepped rhythms special guest vocalists all up in your grill, melismatically emoting as if it’s going out of fashion, which, alas, it isn’t.The guest artists are a particular problem when they’re tasked with writing words: the sound of rapper LunchMoney Lewis wanging on about getting drunk in the club seems desperately unsophisticated compared to the best of Chic’s lyrics, always more complex and anxious about dancefloor hedonism and African American aspiration than they first appeared. “You are now listening to Chic,” offers a voiceover early on, in imitation of the tongue-in-cheek lyrical branding found on Le Freak or Chic Cheer. But there are moments when it seems just as well they reminded you, when It’s About Time could be by pretty much anyone.If it was all like that, then It’s About Time would be easier to regretfully dismiss. But it isn’t. Even when they’re nearly anonymous, Nile Rodgers’ guitar is buoyant and propulsive, and his playing is an unalloyed joy throughout. And there are points where the songwriting clicks, hitting a sweet spot between then and now. The opening Till the World Falls updates the escapist theme of 1979’s Good Times for an equally troubled era, albeit less subtly I Dance My Dance, tellingly one of the tracks free of guest stars, is great. Your attitude to State of Mine (It’s About Time) might depend on your tolerance for jazz-funk instrumentals, but it sounds fantastic: rich, deep, subtly done and beautifully crafted, it fits with the classic Chic notion of music as a form of luxury goods. And there are nice moments: the way Boogie All Night unexpectedly crashes in with no intro, throwing the listener into the centre of the action the strange but effective melding of the vocals of Emeli Sandé and Elton John on the ballad Queen the unexpected, thrilling key change in the middle of the otherwise desultory Do You Wanna Party.The album It’s About Time most obviously recalls is Giorgio Moroder’s Déjà Vu, on which another bona-fide genius boosted by Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories made a lunge for latterday relevance, with mixed results. You can entirely understand Rodgers’ desire to demonstrate he’s still a fully functioning hit-making machine in a different musical climate. Equally, it’s obvious that It’s About Time’s highlights come when it seems least bothered about going for the Top 40 jugular when it sounds more like the work of a man with nothing left to prove, than a man trying to prove himself.Julia Holter – I Shall Love 2The first fruits from her forthcoming album Aviary: one of those moments where all Holter’s strangeness and idiosyncrasy coalesce into a fantastic, epic song."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53f93bf935ee1ed33ff5fc7ee9cd2f98e1961a1a/0_0_4000_2655/master/4000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14a37febb57d5a3cb28d1843c1973e6c 1400w","title":"government hid details of northern powerhouse minister james wharton visits to the north","story":"Two years and £40,000 was spent hiding how little James Wharton travelled to the north of England in his roleThe government has spent two years and £40,000 of taxpayers’ money trying to hide how little the Northern Powerhouse minister visited the north of England in his role, in what one prominent northern figure called “a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability”.In February 2016 the  submitted a freedom of information (FOI) request to the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) asking how regularly James Wharton, who had then been Northern Powerhouse minister for just over six months, travelled outside London.The department flouted a requirement to respond to the request within 20 working days and did not provide a response for more than four months – at which point they denied the application.The Information Commissioner’s Office then undertook an investigation, during the course of which it found that the department adopted “what appears to have been a strategy of wilful procrastination in order to obstruct a request for information”.DCLG appealed the decision to the first-tier tribunal of information rights, where in early 2018 Judge Hazel Oliver ruled that the department must hand over Wharton’s diary.From start to finish, the process took 26 months.The department fought for so long to prevent the release of the information that two other men, Andrew Percy and Jake Berry, have since taken up the role of Northern Powerhouse minister, and the entire department has been renamed as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.However, internal communications revealed by subsequent FOI requests by the  show that despite spending £40,000 trying to stymie the release of information, the government knew as early as March 2016 it had little chance of preventing the information being made public.Hidden in 111 pages of internal DCLG emails relating to the FOI request is a document headlined “Official – Sensitive” dating from March 2016 which includes official advice stating “there is a strong likelihood of a decision to withhold the requested information … being overturned”.Legal experts are unimpressed. “It sounds like a classic: they knew they were likely to lose and still wasted time and money on it, and come out looking even worse,” said Paul Bernal, senior lecturer in law at the University of East Anglia.Manchester-based data protection consultant Tim Turner said: “Departments have shown time and again that they’re very secretive about who ministers meet and what they do, and spending £40,000 to hide it doesn’t seem close to the spirit of open government.”The information that the government tried to suppress for two years shows that Wharton rarely left London as part of his role as the north’s representative in government.Of the 693 lines of entries in Wharton’s ministerial diary, just under half contain identifiable addresses or office rooms in the “Location” column. Ninety percent of them are based in London.Sarah Longlands, director of IPPR North, a Manchester-based thinktank, said: “It is of course disappointing that the minister charged with the Northern Powerhouse spent so little time in the area getting to understand what’s important to the people, communities and businesses of the north.“But the attempts to thwart access to information about the work of the Northern Powerhouse minister show a blatant disregard for the principles of democratic accountability.“The government need to use this as an opportunity to build a much more robust system of transparency and accountability, so that voters in the north can have confidence that the government are really serious and committed to supporting northern leaders to build a better future for the north.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, said: “We respect the outcome of the tribunal and have now released the information as requested.” They did not acknowledge queries about the low number of visits to the north of England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a20b3de74b71c4c7b033ded94e9995739ff6bdc/281_0_4542_2726/master/4542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=468197d6e926d41c469fae5a294508bf","title":"no deal brexit could result in northern ireland blackouts leaks reveal","story":"Residents face drastic price rises and being cut off from Irish Republic’s electricity supplies, documents showNorthern Ireland faces blackouts and drastic electricity price rises in the event of a no-deal Brexit, leaked government documents reveal.The country would likely be cut off from electricity supplies from the Republic of Ireland and unable to use its sole electricity link to the UK mainland, according to an internal briefing.Officials have been warning for months that Northern Ireland’s electricity market could collapse, triggering “unprecedented consequences” and forcing authorities to prepare to take energy infrastructure into public ownership to keep the lights on.The government documents, shared widely across Whitehall and seen by the , show that in the event of a no-deal Brexit:• Householders in Northern Ireland could see electricity bills rise by up to £200.• Energy companies could collapse.• Diesel generators would be needed to keep power supplies running.• The UK government has not yet talked to power station operators in Northern Ireland.For more than a decade, Ireland and Northern Ireland have had a joint electricity market, known as the Single Electricity Market (SEM), allowing power to be traded across the border.But that market would probably collapse if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, because there would no longer be a basis for staying in the SEM. A deal with the EU is described as “essential” to the market’s future.Officials expect that for two years Northern Ireland would not be able to draw power supplies from the country’s sole electricity link to the UK mainland, the Moyle interconnector to Scotland, while new cross-border arrangements were drawn up.One of the country’s main power stations, the Kilroot plant in County Antrim, is due to close on Sunday, after it failed to secure subsidies to provide backup power.The Unite union said that the warnings of blackouts should lead to a rethink on the closure of Kilroot, which represents more than a third of the country’s electricity generating capacity.Senior energy industry figures have told the  that Northern Ireland is not sustainable as an energy market on its own, because of its relatively small size.However, they believe that in the event of a no-deal Brexit and the SEM collapsing, a way would be found to keep electricity supplies running cross-border.Previous government leaks have suggested that a flotilla of electricity generators on barges could be sent to Northern Ireland if the UK crashed out of the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1742487a708c008992b46eeb3a6cd3001eac1d4/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=475caa264858a1d94de4d6780b0c3a26","title":"theresa may un iran brexit analysis","story":"PM’s foreign policies have been submerged by Brexit, giving the impression the UK has checked out of world debatesA mixture of personal praise of Donald Trump, sympathy for the UK after the chemical attack in Salisbury and safety in sheer numbers protected Theresa May from being on the front rank of international leaders who lined up at the UN general assembly to criticize Donald Trump’s Iran policy.Other European leaders – including Margot Wallstrom the Swedish foreign minister and Emmanuel Macron, the global torch bearer of multilateralism – openly rebuked Trump at the Security Council meeting on Wedbesday.“We have tried sanctions over the years. We tried isolation, and it only gave the most conservative forces in Iran more power,” said Wallstrom. Macron suggested that Trump had no long-term strategy.Off stage, the Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen was even more direct, saying that “a war with Iran will sooner or later be envisaged.”May, by contrast, was matter-of-fact in her disagreement with the US, preferring to focus her fire on Russia for its “desperate fabrications” over Salisbury – remarks that provoked a stinging rebuke from the somewhat cornered Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.The prime minister tried to minimise her differences with Trump by praising him personally for his leadership role in seeking to reach an agreement with North Korea, which she described as the world’s most potent nuclear threat. She made no comment on the wider damage caused by Trump’s decision to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran.But there was no disguising the fact that the UK finds itself in the awkward position of being at odds with Trump over a central issue of his administration: how to make Iran change course.May and her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, have joined with France, Germany, Russia and China in concluding that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, and – whatever its malign behaviour elsewhere there is no evidence that a sanctions squeeze will produce a more flexible mindset in Tehran – let alone regime change.That view is held strongly throughout the foreign office, and national security network, despite the frustration of some of the UK’s closest allies in the Gulf such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.The UAE – ferocious networkers in British government circles – have for more than a year tried to persuade the UK to confront Iran over its behaviour in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.The language between the US and the EU over sanctions is also becoming fruity.It is not a conversation that UK officials enjoy, as they seek to show Britain can have leverage over Iran. But in truth, the British voice on everything else at the UN counts for less than it did under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown – or even David Cameron. May’s forays onto the international stage have been perfunctory by contrast Brown was at the UN on Monday drawing the crowds as he banged the drum to find ways to raise extra cash for education in Africa.But if May has any foreign policy theme, it is submerged by Brexit.Broadcasters accompanying her to New York were each allocated four questions – and each confined themselves to Brexit – as if Iran, the UK’s aid budget, Myanmar, Yemen or even the UK military bombing of Syria were non-issues.Such monomania leaves the impression that the UK is a country apart, involved in its own conversation, and checked out from the world debates.That is not a true picture of British diplomatic effectiveness at the UN – but sometimes impressions become the reality.Even if all goes to plan with Brexit, next year’s general assembly will be just as hard.For the first time in decades, Britain will find itself as a non European Union member, forced to justify its claim to be one of the five permanent members of the UN security council – and British leaders (whoever they may be) will have to work even harder just to be heard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea119faf28eec5a69e99c610b92e0446180e1d9e/0_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9aa88779dfb6625d1df61203953696","title":"may faces revolt from 40 tory mps if she opts for canada brexit deal rudd says politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThese are from Philippe Close, the “bourgmestre” (mayor) of Brussels.Airlines including British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair are among the airlines most exposed in a no-deal Brexit scenario, the credit ratings agency Moody’s has said in a report.“A no-deal Brexit could be significantly credit negative for European airlines,” said Jeanine Arnold, a senior credit officer at Moody’s and author of the report. Travel companies TUI, Thomas Cook and Virgin Atlantic are also among those most exposed, it says.Moody’s identified five main risks including loss of traffic rights between the UK and the EU in the event of no deal, which the government admitted last week could lead to disruption to flights from 30 March. It says the “strong liquidity” of BA, easyJet and Ryanair should enable them to weather the storm “even if flights are disrupted for an extended period”. However it says there could be a longer term impact on airlines negatively affected which “could lead to negative rating actions”. In response to the Moody’s report, British Airways parent group AIG said it was “confident” that a deal would be reached on aviation with the EU. “It’s in the UK and EU’s interests to have a fully liberalised aviation agreement,” it said. Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking at the Jo Cox memorial event in Brussels. He said:Jo was killed in brutal and horrible circumstances. She lived her life to make lives beter for everybody else. She loved her time in Brussels, she loved the spirit and the music, the internationalism, the globalism of this city, and she always gave this message, that we have far more in common, far more than unites us, than can ever possibly ide us.So she treated people as they should be treated, with respect, wherever she worked, in the Congo and other parts of Africa, and other parts of the world, always trying to bring people together, and bring about peace.And I think it’s a wonderful gesture that you, the mayor, and the council of Brussels, have decided to name this square in her memory, so that generations on people can enjoy being in this square, on beautiful days like this, enjoying music, enjoying food, enjoying life, and enjoying understanding each other, and understanding that we can achieve a world free from war, and a word of justice and respect.Here is a live feed of the Jo Cox memorial event in Brussels.The event in Brussels where a square is being named in honour of Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered in 2016, is taking place now. Here are some tweets about it.From the Labour MP Richard CorbettFrom the Independent’s Jon StoneFrom my colleague Daniel BoffeyPeople’s Vote, which is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, says it is holding its largest ever “national day of action” this Saturday. In a press notice it said:There will be over 100 local groups participating, in towns and cities the length and breadth of the country, in areas that voted both remain and leave. Over 2,000 activists and supporters are expected to take part, with more than 1,000 door to door leafleting sessions organised and over 1m leaflets handed out. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor for the West Midlands, has given an interview to the Birmingham Mail ahead of the Tory conference that starts this weekend, in Birmingham. In it, he calls for an end to austerity, saying the cuts have gone far enough. He says:I do also think it is right to say that the cuts have gone far enough.It’s not reasonable to expect that this continues.The ITV Peston show also had Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, on as a guest last night, and he said Labour would be willing to “bend” its red lines in the interests of helping the UK get a Brexit deal. He told the programme:What Jeremy did today this was taking, seizing the initiative, saying to the country look we want to work together in the interests of the country to get a deal. It’s not perfect, but we certainly don’t surely for goodness sake all of us don’t want the no deal that will take us off the edge of that cliff. And if it means compromising, if it means you bending your red line to give us a customs union, we’re prepared to bend our red lines to give, to give this a deal.It was a curious comment because Jeremy Corbyn did not say anything in his party conference speech yesterday that suggested he was altering his stance. He did say Labour might be willing to back a Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May, but that was only on the basis that such a deal matched Labour’s demands.Gardiner is one of the members of the shadow cabinet most worried about Labour being seen as opposing Brexit. According to PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield, Labour sources have been playing down the significance of his comments last night.Nicola Sturgeon is under further pressure to support calls for a second Brexit referendum after Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, warned her “this is not the time to keep your head down.”Speaking in Glasgow later today at a lecture to honour Jimmy Reid, the Clyde shipyards union leader, O’Grady is expected to compliment the first minister for calling for an extension to the article 50 process if the Brexit deal proves to be inadequate.However Sturgeon has vacillated on the question of a referendum on the final Brexit deal: after initially refusing to commit to it, she now says she is not opposed to it in principle but wants to know what Scotland would gain if it again voted differently from the rest of the UK. In the original referendum in 2016, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain while England and Wales out-voted them in favour of leave. Sturgeon has not, however, precisely set out what her terms would be to win the Scottish National party’s backing for it, claiming that is for proponents of the second referendum to set out. Many suspect she worries that backing a second Brexit referendum would require the SNP to accept a second vote on a future Scottish independence referendum.At her Jimmy Reid Foundation lecture O’Grady is expected to say:Like the TUC, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon has rightly called for an extension to article 50. This would give us a chance to negotiate a deal on new terms. A deal that protects jobs, rights and peace in Ireland.But the truth is most people don’t trust the Westminster government to get that deal and we’re running out of road. So I have been taking the same message to all politicians – this is not the time to keep your head down.I hope that Nicola Sturgeon will join me in putting the prime minister on notice. And warn Mrs May that if we don’t get the terms working people need, we will mobilise for a popular vote on the final deal.Sturgeon’s spokesman deflected questions earlier this week on whether she would want the UK parties to guarantee, in return, that they would support a second Scottish independence referendum if Scotland rejected the Brexit deal but the rest of the UK accepted it.He said one option was to structure the Brexit vote in such a way that all four UK nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) needed to support the same result for the referendum to be valid – a proposal effectively giving any of those four a veto on the final result.When people mention Conservative Brexit rebels, you probably think of Jacob Rees-Mogg, his European Research Group and the many Tory MPs who have declared that they could never vote for the Chequers plan advocated by the prime minister. But there are rebels on the pro-European side too, and last night Amber Rudd, the former home secretary and perhaps liberal conservatism’s answer to Rees-Mogg, said there were around 40 MPs on her side who would vote against any Canada-style trade deal with the EU. She told ITV’s Peston last night that she would not vote for such a plan herself and she went on:I think there are a number of people, in fact I’ve talked to a few colleagues and I reckon there are conservatively about 40 of us who would not support a Canada type deal. But to be frank there are so many reasons a Canada type deal doesn’t work, starting with the Irish border, going on to manufacturing that I think we can make those arguments.Why does this matter? Because, as the Daily  reported on Monday, May is under growing pressure to opt for a Canada-style deal. But Labour would not support a Canada-style deal, because it would not retain the benefits of being in the customs union and the single market, and with 40 Tories also voting against, it would have no chance of getting through parliament.On Peston Rudd also said that a second referendum would be better than a no deal Brexit. She said:I don’t think no deal will happen. I think that if we can’t get a negotiated deal that the prime minister brings back through parliament then I think that we’re in completely uncharted territory constitutionally ...I do think it would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexit-y people in my party were unable to support the Prime Minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit. So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.The hiatus between the end of the Labour conference and the start of the Conservative conference is normally a dead period for Westminster politics, but with Brexit the news never entirely dries up and today Jeremy Corbyn is going to Brussels for a meeting with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator.

Much has been made this week of a plan to establish a 12-strong League of Nations competition in November, played over five weeks. But it is one of a number of ideas that are being considered ahead of the governing body’s council meeting in November. What is eventually decided will look a lot different: a commitment made last year was for more fixtures between tier one and two countries.World Rugby’s Bill Beaumont and Agustin Pichot, chairman and vice-chairman respectively, are leading the push for reform, with the latter the more voluble after declaring that international rugby was heading for the scrapheap unless there was a fundamental overhaul.At its urging, World Rugby is setting up a professional game committee, made up of tier one and two nations, and is establishing a professional game forum that will meet every year. It will be made up of delegates from unions, clubs and players’ associations and it fulfils a promise made last year in San Francisco to take a collaborative approach to the major issues facing the game.There will be major changes made to the international calendar and making the November and July windows competitive will add to the load on players.While there would still be three weekends in each month governed by World Rugby’s regulation on player release, coaches would want two weeks of preparation time. That would make 10 weeks in all which, added to the nine weeks players spend with their countries during the Six Nations, would mean the Test game took up half a season in the non-World Cup years between 2020 and 2032.Leagues in Europe are attracting the interest of private equity companies who see untapped income in commercial rights, not least broadcasting. But maximising potential would mean clubs having their leading players for longer than they do now. There does not look to be any scope for a club competition between the best in the hemispheres, even though it would probably prove more compelling than the autumn and summer Test series.The need for clubs to be involved in any change is highlighted by a reason the friendly format is failing – the drift of players from the south to the north. It may prove easier to decide what future Novembers and Julys will look like than to resolve a key question: how should the proceeds from more competitive fixtures be shared?At the moment the match hosts receive all the gate receipts, broadcasting income, commercial deals and anything else that can be squeezed out of punters, apart from a fourth international where the visiting union receives a fee for agreeing to the fixture. One reason the All Blacks’ appearances in England and Wales this decade have become less frequent is because of the New Zealand union’s £3m demand to play.The southern hemisphere nations have long lobbied for income from tier one matches, including Lions tours, to be pooled and shared out. It would raise the turnover of all four and help them retain players. However the European unions, which attract bigger crowds, have consistently refused to entertain the idea.A friendly revamp with a competitive element would resurrect the issue, especially if there were an overall title sponsor. Europe has found that its greater financial muscle has weakened the international game to the point where to carry on and change nothing would be to redden balance sheets here.A new tournament – and that word should be used in the loosest sense because whatever is devised will not be an all-inclusive version of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship – would offer value to backers because it had no past.The Six Nations continues to look for a new title sponsor two years after RBS gave notice. On the surface, it should be easy to sell: it is the sport’s most popular tournament outside the World Cup, playing to packed houses, it is on terrestrial TV and generates large audiences, it is steeped in tradition and its popularity is not defined by the quality of rugby produced.Yet, little more than four months before the start of the 2019 championship, they have still been unable to command the price they want. The uncertainty over Brexit is a factor but, as RBS found, the Six Nations, like the FA Cup, does not lend itself to a sponsor’s name in the title and backers expect a return.The point of the Sydney summit, and Pichot’s outburst this month, was to underline the primacy of international rugby, but at a period of flux it is not that simple.

John Ashdown here briefly taking over from Tom while he heads to get some lunch.I’ve tried and failed for the past 10 minutes to come up with some serviceable Kaiser Chiefs-golf puns. If only the opening ceremony featured the Chiefs’ 2005-era alumni Hard-Fi and their first album Pars of CCTV. Here all week, try the veal, etc and so forth.With three hours to go to the opening ceremony, here’s a taster of what we can expect. It’ll be hosted by David Ginola (er, naturally), and include music from the Kaiser Chiefs and French artist Jain, after which the captains introduce the teams and name their pairings.“The excitement is building,” roars Stephen Pye in an email. “I’m off tonight to buy my own body weight in Guinness and salted snacks, and I can’t wait another minute (as Five Star once said). I’m very tempted with the 121 being offered on the draw. I also wondered if you might be interested in this blog I have written on Eamonn Darcy becoming a Ryder Cup hero on this day in 1987?”Ah, go on thenAt a time like this, the Ryder Cup is sure to be ined for political symbolism. And here’s an interesting read from Angelique Chrisafis and David Smith.“In the midst of Brexit negotiations – and a Brexit which is struggling to work out – the Ryder Cup is the chance to see Europeans together and united facing the US, that is a good image,” said Jean-Baptiste Guégan, a Paris-based lecturer on geopolitics and sport.… He added: “There will surely be an element of nationalism coming into play somewhere. For Donald Trump, this is one of the rare sports he plays. He’ll watch this event, he’ll make use of it.”The traditional past captains match is under way. It pits the USA’s Corey Pavin, Tom Lehman, Ben Crenshaw and Hal Sutton against Europe’s Tony Jacklin, Paul McGinley, Mark James and José María Olazábal. And for what it’s worth the 74-year-old Jacklin, partnering McGinley against Pavin and Lehman, has just sent a wonderful drive onto the green on the par-three 3rd, though he misses his birdie putt. The hole is halved and the America pair remain one up.Nostalgia corner – feast your eyes on this Ryder Cup gallery:“Looks like an American-style course,” says simonsaint BTL. “Anyone know who designed it?” A vexed question, this. The French golfing federation commissioned the French building architect Hubert Chesneau to lead the project in 1985, but the vastly more golf-savvy designer Robert von Hagge (b Chicago) was subsequently enlisted by Chesneau, alongside Frenchman Pierre Thevenin. Paul Casey has been speaking ahead of his first Ryder Cup for a decade. is determined to make the most of what could be the 41-year-old’s last Ryder Cup in Europe.Casey gave up his European Tour membership in order to concentrate on getting back inside the world’s top 50, which was vindicated when the world No 21 won the Valspar Championship in March, which helped earned his subsequent wild card from Thomas Bjørn. “I made the decision to rejoin the Tour almost two years ago and so to be sitting here now is very satisfying, very enjoyable,” Casey said. “I think I’ve got more of an appreciation this time around. I’ve taken notes this week and tried to really pay attention to how special this is. “At 41 I don’t know how many opportunities I’m going to get to play another European-based Ryder Cup. I don’t want this to be my last, but plain and simple, at 41, it’s got a chance that it is. So I just want to make sure that I pay attention to it and enjoy it, deliver points, play my heart out, but enjoy it at the same time.” Amid all the talk of local indifference, there’s plenty of people in:So what’s it like to play Le Golf National if you’re an amateur hacker?

The Ryder Cup is nearly upon us, bringing with it as many subplots and points of intrigue as this tournament has bestowed. The hype and hoopla seems to get ratcheted up that bit more with each edition, but there’s no doubt that there’s plenty to get our teeth into.We may be talking about a team game but there’s no escaping the stardust sprinkled on this year’s buildup by Tiger Woods, fresh from his stunning Tour Championship triumph last week, which seemingly completed his career journey from cold-eyed ruthless major-gatherer through disgraced fallen genius to affectionately regarded Great Old Champion. But he’s lost more Ryder Cups than he’s won so can he make a dent in that record here? On the European side, Will Thomas Bjørn’s contentious faith in another seasoned campaigner, Sergio García, be vindicated in a team featuring five rookies?And Bjørn has rung the changes on the final day of practice. Europe’s captain appeared to offer a hint to potential pairings for Friday’s afternoon foursomes matches. Rory McIlroy, Francesco Molinari, Ian Poulter and Thorbjørn Olesen made up the opening group, with Tommy Fleetwood, Jon Rahm, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson in the second. Paul Casey, García, Tyrrell Hatton and Alex Norén were in the final group, Noren having won the French Open at Le Golf National in July.The USA’s captain Jim Furyk kept Woods, Patrick Reed, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas in the same group for the second day running, with a Woods-Reed pairing looking increasingly certain. Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau were in the same group for the third day in succession and were joined by Rickie Fowler and Dustin Johnson, while the final group contained former partners Webb Simpson and Bubba Watson, and Tony Finau and Brooks Koepka.We’ll be providing regular updates of the day’s buildup, including news on pairings and culminating in the opening ceremony at 4pm BST.Here’s the teams’ Ryder Cup records:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a50a294de12f66b1d4541c5292f9a1961146e04/1_0_4039_2424/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c213eb64cd06c6ca73a4d4a00a6210","title":"iphone xs max review apple supersized smartphone","story":"Its massive screen is beautiful, but has it lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X so good?Apple’s top of the line smartphone has been supersized in both screen size and price, but is the iPhone XS Max really worth the eye-watering £1,099-plus asking price?Apple’s biggest achievement is that the colossal screen has been squeezed into a body that isn’t that enormous. The iPhone XS Max is certainly a big phone, but at 7.7mm thick it’s thinner than all of the current top-end phones, including the 8.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy Note 9.At 157.5mm long the iPhone XS Max is also shorter than even phones with much smaller screens such as the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL (157.9mm long), the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ (158.1mm long) and is a full 4.4mm shorter than the Note 9.The thing is the iPhone XS Max is actually one of the more difficult super-sized phones to handle. That’s partly because it’s marginally wider than the competition at 77.4mm wide, which is 1mm wider than the Note 9 and a full 3.6mm wider than the S9+. But the biggest difference between the iPhone and the rest is Apple’s use of rounded sides.Yes, they look and feel luxurious in stainless steel, but they’re difficult to get a solid grip on with your fingers. Others taper to an edge of some sort along the sides, which gives your fingers purchase.Unless you have abnormally large hands, the iPhone XS Max is therefore almost exclusively a two-handed phone, even with Apple’s reachability, which brings the top of the screen down to the middle – try and use it with one hand at your peril, as this metal and glass sandwich will smash if you drop it.In day-to-day operation it’s not noticeably faster than the iPhone X, which already feels snappy and responsive with iOS 12. But as with other recent iPhone upgrades, the raw power will only likely come into its own with new software, speeding up AR experiences and other bits and pieces behind the scenes.The battery life of the iPhone XS Max was slightly disappointing. It will get through the daylight hours without issue, but it won’t rival the Huaweis of this world. It lasted just over 27 hours between charges, starting at 7am on day one and lasting right through till past 10am on day two.That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix and shooting around 10 or so photos a day. The Lightning connector in the bottom is still the fastest way to charge the phone, with a full charge taking around two hours using an optional fast charger and USB-C cable.For perspective the iPhone X lasted for 30 hours under the same conditions, while last year’s Huawei’s Mate 10 Pro lasted 50 hours. This year’s Samsung’s Galaxy S9+ only lasted 26 hours and the Note 9 only 25 hours, so it seems we’ve taken a step back in battery life in 2018. Apple’s strength is that it pushes software updates to phones for a long time. The iPhone 5S, released in 2013, runs the same version of iOS as the iPhone XS Max.The differences in how they behave come down to the gesture-based navigation that was introduced with the iPhone X last year, and not a lot has changed because iOS 12 concentrated on optimisation over new features.The big addition is a set of wellbeing tools, alongside much better group notifications, which can be dismissed in one go. Siri Shortcuts, an extra app you can download, also allows power-user automation should you want it, setting up custom routines and trigger words you can utter to Siri.One of the downsides with the iPhone XS Max is how little Apple has made of the large screen in software. There’s no split-screen multitasking or anything of that ilk. A few of Apple’s apps have a few more features compared to the smaller iPhone XS.When in landscape there’s a slide-out inbox selector in Mail, chat selector in Messages, Reminders and Contacts get a split-screen view, while Calendar gets an iPad-style Day, Week, Month, Year selector and new view. The Settings app also adopts an iPad-style view in landscape. But these changes aren’t as useful as the enormous wealth of productivity features put into phones with screens this large by Samsung.The dual camera system on the back of the iPhone XS Max has been improved since it first appeared on the iPhone X and 8 Plus last year. It features the same combo of 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle and one with an effective optical zoom of 2x, but both image sensors and algorithms have been updated.The result is markedly better low light performance, which still doesn’t quite beat rivals from Samsung or Huawei, but comes much closer. Detail preservation in images at full crop is also much improved, coming much closer to that of Google’s Pixel 2 XL.The improved HDR mode, which is now on by default, is also better at dealing with high-contrast scenes, meaning shots into the sun and other bright areas are not as much of a problem.Portraits are now noticeably better too, particularly the shallow depth of field effect around hair and other extremities. The bokeh is also now adjustable after the fact, which is fun.The selfie camera is good, but not quite as rich in detailas some rivals. Video is also good, with better stabilisation than previous iPhones.Overall the iPhone XS Max’s camera is rival for the very best in the business.The iPhone XS Max comes in black, silver or gold, costing £1,099 for 64GB of storage, £1,249 for 256GB or £1,449 for 512GB.The iPhone XS Max is big, beautiful and expensive. Its primary selling point is that enormous, gorgeous screen, which is really only useful for watching video or viewing photos.But in maximising the screen, Apple has lost some of the charm that made the iPhone X and its replacement the XS so good. It is much more difficult to handle, heavier and bigger in your pocket.The camera is great, battery life is OK, there’s wireless charging and a myriad of other features. It oozes opulence in a way other smartphones just don’t. But the same can be said of its smaller sibling. And there’s there’s the slightly smaller and cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR arriving later.If you want the biggest iPhone, and can stomach the eye-watering asking price, then this is it. Just try not to drop it.Cons: no fingerprint scanner, very expensive, no fast charger in the box, no headphone socket, massive body This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Other things being equal, should I go for an AMD processor with a 128GB SSD or an Intel PC with 8GB of memory, a 1TB HDD and Optane? A comparison of processor performance shows very little difference, and the two options have very similar prices.I typically run a browser with multiple tabs, Acrobat Reader with large pdf files, one or more of the Microsoft Office suite, plus the proprietary software for my business. I don’t do high-end graphics processing or gaming, but would your advice be different if I did? RuthThe difference between the two PCs boils down to how much storage you need and the performance of the Optane accelerator in the Intel-based machine.Most buyers have to choose between expensive but fast SSDs (solid-state drives) and cheaper, slower but much larger HDDs (hard disk drives). I answered this question in June (What is the best laptop drive for students?), providing some background on the different technologies used.Reading it now might help, but to summarise, the best answer for most laptop users is an SSD. Ideally, it should be an M.2 module with NVM Express (NVMe) drivers and controllers, rather than the traditional SSD that fits into a standard drive bay and uses a SATA connection. However, any SSD will do the job well.Desktop PC users have other options, with Optane accelerators being one of the most cost-effective. I use one myself.Basically, Optane provides a high-speed cache between the processor and the HDD. This increases the responsiveness of your PC, giving you close to SSD speeds at HDD prices.Desktop PC users typically want to have masses of data readily available, including decades-worth of documents, photos, music and video files. These won’t fit on an affordable SSD, so desktops often have 1TB or larger HDDs.If you have too much data for an SSD, one option is to fit a second internal hard drive, so make sure the PC you buy has at least one empty drive bay. You can also store data and backups on external hard drives or online, but both are much slower than using an internal drive.The other option is to add an Optane cache to accelerate a traditional hard drive. There are some limitations, but in general, this should outperform a SATA-style SSD in a drive bay. You can get the best of both worlds.Optane is a new type of memory chip developed in secret by Intel and Micron in a partnership that will end next year. They call the technology 3D XPoint (cross point). It might be an example of ReRAM (resistive random-access memory), but don’t quote me on that. It’s certainly different.3D XPoint chips fit into the gap between standard memory chips (RAM) and the Flash memory chips used in SSDs. 3D XPoint chips are slower and cheaper than RAM chips, but dramatically faster and costlier than SSD chips. Over the long term, more advanced 3D XPoint chips will replace RAM chips for some purposes (Intel has already announced 512GB memory modules) and Flash chips for other purposes.Intel sells 3D XPoint devices under the Optane brand label while Micron uses QuantX.Intel has taken the lead partly because it can manufacture processors, support chips and motherboards that work with Optane. Specifically, Optane requires a seventh- or eighth-generation Intel Core processor, a motherboard with recent Intel support chips (eg Z270 or Z250), Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) V15.5 or later drivers, and a GPT formatted hard drive, not MBR (PDF).The latest version of Optane works with secondary hard drives, not just \u0026nbsp64-bit Windows 10 boot drives. This is a useful step forward. Unfortunately, it requires an eighth-generation Core processor and a motherboard with Intel Series 300 or later support chips. You can buy Optane accelerators and SSDs in the usual places, but getting them to work properly can be another matter. Even if you have a compatible PC, you may need to update the BIOSUEFI firmware and download new drivers. It’s simpler to buy a new desktop PC with Optane pre-installed.Given the price of Optane SSDs, most users will settle for 16GB or 32GB M.2 modules installed as caches, using the Intel management software supplied. The first time you run a program or load data, you won’t see any difference. Loading programs again is extremely fast, because they are being loaded from the Optane cache. In my experience with a 1TB hard drive and a 16GB Optane cache, performance is comparable with a traditional SATA SSD and approaching that of an M.2 SSD, for most normal purposes.Optane chips are “non-volatile” so, unlike RAM chips, they remember whatever they are storing even if you turn the power off.You don’t have to worry about which programs and data are cached because the software manages that automatically.However, you may have problems if you run so many different programs that they won’t fit into the cache available. Someone who runs a lot of multi-level AAA games might well be in that position. Someone who regularly throws 16GB data files around may not see many benefits from Optane, and may suffer slowdowns due to cache swapping.Your use sounds much like mine. I typically run two browsers with around 50 to 250 tabs and one or two Microsoft Office programs, which are lightweights by today’s standards. I also do some photo and video editing. Given my predictable usage, Optane works very well. If I did run into problems, I think I could solve them by swapping the 16GB module for a 32GB version.However, someone who uses very large programs andor large data files might well be better off with a 256GB or larger SSD than a cached hard drive. Also, the more unpredictable you are, the worse it is for any cache.The most cost-effective compromise might be a SATA SSD for the boot disk with an Optane-accelerated secondary HDD. Please comment below if you’ve done that.I admit to being sceptical about Optane memory before I tried it. It wasn’t on my list as a required specification. It just happened to be included in a Dell XPS Core i5-84008GB PC that had the specs I wanted at an attractive price (£699), and I assumed it couldn’t do any harm. If it didn’t work well, I could always install a cheap SSD and use the built-in HDD as a secondary drive. (Yes, Optane will speed up an SSD!)Having used it for 10 months without running into any problems, I can recommend it. However, I haven’t done any serious speed tests. Others have.For example, TweakTown has tested a 32GB Optane cache in great depth, while AnandTech has tested this year’s 64GB module. Both make useful comments.TweakTown and Tom’s Hardware reinforce the point that we don’t spend much time copying sequential files, which is how people often test drive speeds. Most of the time, we’re doing random-access reads. That is where SSDs are at their weakest, and Optane is at its strongest.Have you got a question?

Only here can you eat Belgian specialities cooked by local chefs, several of them holders of Michelin stars. Pop-up stalls this year offer dishes such as Zeebrugge shrimp with poached egg, buttermilk and sourdough, Belgian pancakes paired with Liefmans beer and, for the more adventurous, Flemish white tripe with mustard and peanuts served with spring rolls.

The world’s most northerly culinary festival, Taste Svalbard, is held in Longyearbyen, the administrative centre, with concerts, pop-up dinners and film screenings.Stay: Coal Miners’ Cabins (doubles from £85, including breakfast but with shared bathrooms) on the edge of Longyearbyen7-8 October Is Georgia in Europe? It depends who you ask. Some parts of Tbilisi certainly look European, and many Georgians feel they belong more in Europe than in Asia, yet one definition of Europe marks the Caucasus mountains as its border, putting Georgia in Asia. Either way, there are now direct flights from London taking just over four hours. And, for food, it is very much worth it. Cuisine is hard-wired into the Georgian soul and in the capital, Tbilisi, restaurants offer spicy salsa-like adjika, plates of pickled chillies, trout tartare, bowls of spinach pkhali (a minced vegetable dip) and – the ultimate Georgian comfort food – khachapuri, canoe-shaped cheesy bread with a wobbling, almost raw egg in the centre.

Every autumn, from September to November, skilled truffle hunters search the dark forests around the towns of Motovun and Buzet, led by highly trained dogs adept at sniffing out truffles hidden in the soil. Livade, a renowned truffle village near Motovun, hosts the annual Tuberfest celebrating the region’s famous truffles with auctions, live cooking demonstrations and a white truffle fair. Local delicacies include pasta topped with truffles and truffle-infused ice cream.Stay: Istarske Toplice in Livade (doubles from £38 B\u0026ampB)27-28 October Espelette pepper, the cornerstone of Basque cuisine and ranking just 4,000 on the Scoville scale (roughly the same as a jalapeño), is harvested late summer around the French-Basque town of Espelette. This annual festival, organised by the Confrérie du Piment d’Espelette, celebrates the chilli pepper and its production with choir concerts, blessings at churches and large banquets featuring peppery local dishes such as stews and chocolate cakes.

We were on our honeymoon and the lovely couple even offered to let us try on their own wedding kimonos and take photos.• Double from £65 B\u0026ampB, about £120 with dinner, oshiryokanen-gbLucie JohnsonAt the foot of 600-metre Mount Takao, a great day hike within the Tokyo city bounds, is the tucked-away Keio Takaosan Onsen. With a mix of indoor and outdoor (rotenburo) baths of various water temperatures, it is the perfect place to restore sore muscles, with all the vibe of a mountain ryokan (traditional inn) for a fraction of the price:£6.70 for adults and no time limit. You just need to bring your own towel. The onsen is next to Takaosanguchi station on the Keio line.Sarah LiangYou can save thousands of yen by hiring a campervan from japancampers. It’s near Narita airport, and runs a pick-up service from Narita station, so you can be mobile within a few hours of arriving. The campers start at ¥6,000 a day (£40), less than you’d pay for a hotel room, and come with camping equipment. The staff are helpful, bilingual and just a phone call away if you run into difficulties. It is perfectly legal to sleep in your van anywhere you stop, giving you the freedom to roam around the world’s safest country, and the Japanese baths (sentos) are on hand for your daily scrub.DomInstead of drinking in western-style bars, which can be very expensive, go to a typical izakaya such as Kin no Kura in Shinjuku, Tokyo, where I’d suggest a nomihodai option – all you can drink for a set time and set price. Pay around £17 for 2-3 hours of uninterrupted drinking! Order from a tablet on the table, and the server will announce briskly: “Hai dozo!” (Go ahead). It’s a great, social place too – ideal for playing card games. The range of drinks include beer on tap, highballs and sake. You can also get a tabehodai (all you can eat option in izakayas). • 1-16-6 KabukichoDarrenThe Kaisu Hostel (6-13-5 Akasaka) in Minato is a short walk from Roppongi but quiet enough to have a good night’s sleep in its shared rooms with pods. It’s spotless – like almost all Japanese hotels – and serves great beer in the stylish bar area and at around £20 a night it was great value. It has a female-only shared room too, with 10 pods. It’s a short walk to an izakaya called Motsusen (lunch £3.40, dinner £19 and all-you-can-drink menu, 9-2 Kabutocho) where you can rub shoulders with salarymen and eat until you can’t move.BenI accidentally miscalculated how much cash to bring (my hotel gave price per night rather than the total of all three nights and I was careless in checking) and on my last day in Tokyo I was broke ... I took myself to a sento for the afternoon for the equivalent of £3. I spent a couple of hours in there, sheltering from the 38C heat, getting clean after a sweaty day stomping the streets and having a cultural experience at the same time. It was one of the highlights of my Japan trip because, as well as being a sucker for a spa, it was great to feel SO comfortable strutting about naked – because nobody bats an eyelid. Best three quid I ever spent. GabyIf you want to try conveyor belt sushi, Genki Sushi, with branches from Hokkaido down to Kyushu, is a great choice. Most of its dishes only cost 70p and you can order your food via multilingual touch screens. If you’re with kids, they are going to love being able to order their own food, as well as the little robot trains that deliver your order to your seat. We visited the Shibuya branch in Tokyo and it was wonderful, but later on we saw the dinner queue stretching into the street, so best get there early.Bori KissLooking for a holiday with a difference?

He and Ford will deliver diametrically opposing accounts at the extraordinary televised hearing, as fresh accusations of sexual misconduct and contradictory charges swirl around a circus-like confirmation process that has been described as “surreal” and “political as hell”.The committee – 11 Republicans, all men, and 10 Democrats – will each have five minutes to question Kavanaugh and Ford. It will be the first time the country sees and hears from Ford since she came forward with her contention less than two weeks ago.“I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t remember as much as I would like to,” Ford will tell the panel, according to prepared remarks released on Wednesday. “But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget.”In her testimony, Ford calls Kavanaugh “the boy who sexually assaulted me”, ruling out any suggestion that she may be confusing him with another person.But late on Wednesday night, the Senate judiciary committee released a timeline of all staff activity in response to the allegations against Kavanaugh. The summary disclosed that staff have interviewed two different men who each told investigators “he, not Judge Kavanaugh, had the encounter with Dr Ford in the summer of 1982 that is the basis of her allegation”. The committee did not identify the men.In her testimony, Ford describes the night of the assault, stating: “I believed he was going to rape me.” She also explains the winding path that began with a letter to her congresswoman and an anonymous tip to the Washington Post and resulted in her stepping forward publicly and agreeing to testify on Capitol Hill.“I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified,” she will say. “I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.”In his testimony, Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s second supreme court nominee, will acknowledge that he was “not perfect” in high school but will adamantly deny Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her, declaring himself “innocent of this charge”. He has also unequivocally denied allegations of sexual misconduct made public by two other women this week.“I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now,” Kavanaugh will tell the committee, according to prepared remarks released by the committee on Wednesday. “But that’s not why we are here today. What I’ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior.”A new accuser, Julie Swetnick, came forward on Wednesday, aided by the celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, to allege in a sworn declaration that she observed Kavanaugh at high school parties where women were verbally and physically abused, including being present at one in which she was the victim of a “gang rape”.Kavanaugh dismissed the latest allegations as “ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone” as Trump stood by his embattled nominee, accusing Democrats of “bringing people out of the woods” in an 11th-hour attempt to block his confirmation.The judge also denied two separate allegations against him in an interview with Republican investigators for the Senate judiciary committee, according to a transcript of the conference call released by the panel on Wednesday.In the transcript, Kavanaugh denied assaulting a woman he was dating in 1998 while working for the independent counsel Ken Starr. The second incident he denied in the call related to an allegation made by an unidentified Rhode Island man “concerning a rape on a boat in August of 1985”. Speaking on Wednesday, Trump said it was possible that he could change his mind on Kavanaugh.“We’re giving the women a major chance to speak. It’s possible I’ll hear that and I’ll say: ‘Hey, I’m changing my mind.’ It’s possible,” he said.But he otherwise stood by his nominee, calling the allegations against Kavanaugh a “big, fat con job”. Speaking at length to reporters in New York, Trump said he viewed the accusations against Kavanaugh “differently” because he himself had “had a lot of false charges made against me”.“You have a man who is great, outstanding, but he has charges against him,” Trump said, adding: “It has happened to me many times.”Republicans had expected Kavanaugh to sail through his confirmation process, but it has deeply ided the country. Protesters have flooded the Capitol and staged walkouts while Kavanaugh’s supporters defend him as a lifelong champion of women and a distinguished jurist.In light of the third accusation, the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has called on Kavanaugh to withdraw and another senator, Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, has filed a lawsuit in an attempt to halt the hearing.The Senate committee says it is making an effort to hold staff interviews with Swetnick and a third woman, Deborah Ramirez, who alleged in the New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party when they were students at Yale.Thursday’s hearing will take place against the backdrop of the #MeToo, a movement that has toppled powerful men across industries. Aware of the significance of the moment, the all-male Republican panel on the committee will cede their questions to the Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell in an effort, they say, to “depoliticize” the session.Lawyers for Kavanaugh on Wednesday released to several news organizations five calendar pages from 1982 that will be presented to bolster his assertion that he was not at a house party with Ford decades ago.At the same time, lawyers for Ford provided affidavits from four people – three from friends and one from her husband – who say that she told them in recent years she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when she was in high school. They also released a copy of a polygraph test she took in August, which concluded that her description of the account was “not indicative of deception”.Republicans have scheduled a committee vote for Friday and many senators say they are eager to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination. But a handful of key Republican senators have said their vote hinges on Thursday’s hearing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2fba21027a5386175a124de7a2ab4f950bf0807/0_209_6269_3761/master/6269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8fbadb81d907f30b3395abc072fa56f","title":"mark judge brett kavanaugh author schoolfriend witness","story":"The writer of Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk is alleged to have been present when the supreme court nominee committed sexual assaultIn the allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh, one other name recurs: Mark Judge.Christine Blasey Ford became the first woman to come forward to accuse Donald Trump’s nominee for the supreme court of sexual misconduct earlier this month, throwing what had been his almost certain confirmation process into doubt.Ford alleged that Judge, Kavanaugh’s high school friend and author of Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk, an autobiographical account of debauchery at the elite Washington school Georgetown Prep, was in the room when Kavanaugh forced himself on her at a school party.On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick, the third woman to come forward, said that Judge, along with Kavanaugh, was part of a group of men who would “cause girls to become inebriated and disorientated so they could then be ‘gang raped’”.Kavanaugh has denied Ford and Swetnick’s accusations, as well as the accusations of another woman, Deborah Ramirez, that he “thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent”.Judge has also disputed Ford’s and Swetnick’s allegations. But their claims have put the author – who in 2015 wrote about the “ambiguous middle ground” of sexual pursuit – firmly into the national spotlight.Both Ford and Swetnick have urged the Senate judiciary committee to interview Judge under oath, with Swetnick saying he has “significant information concerning the conduct of Brett Kavanaugh in the 1980s, especially as it relates to his actions towards women”.Swetnick said on Wednesday she had met Judge and Kavanaugh, who she described as “extremely close friends”, at a series of parties in the early 1980s.During that time, Swetnick said, she “witnessed efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys …” Swetnick says it was at one such party, with Judge and Kavanaugh present, that Swetnick herself was sexually assaulted.Judge went into hiding after Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, but the Washington Post tracked him down in Bethany Beach, Delaware, on Monday. Judge would not speak to the paper beyond asking: “How’d you find me?”, but his own body of work over the past two decades reveals a portrait of the man at the center of supreme court nomination proceedings.A recovering alcoholic, Judge wrote in Wasted, published in 1997, about a pact he and friends at Georgetown Prep made to consume 100 kegs of beer before graduation.He describes a heavy drinking culture at the all-boys private school, and writes of one incident where a person named “Bart O’Kavanaugh” vomited in someone’s car and then “passed out on his way back from a party”.Ford alleges it was at one of those high school parties that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. Interviewed by the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard Judge addressed the allegations against Kavanaugh. Judge was asked if he witnessed any “rough-housing” with a female student during high school. Judge said he didn’t.“I can’t. I can recall a lot of rough-housing with guys,” Judge said. “I don’t remember any of that stuff going on with girls.”But Elizabeth Rasor, Judge’s girlfriend at Catholic University, said he had given her a very different account of life at Georgetown Prep.In an interview with the New Yorker, Rasor said Judge had told her about an incident at high school when he and other boys took turns in having sex with a drunk woman. Judge regarded it as fully consensual, Rasor told the New Yorker, adding that she was troubled by the story. Judge denied Rasor’s account.According to a Washington Post profile, in recent years Judge has juggled writing with working in a record store, a liquor store and as a substitute teacher and house sitter. He publishes only sporadically, but a 2015 article for Splice Today seems pertinent to the accusations Kavanaugh faces, and the calls for Judge to testify.In the piece Judge wrote about the seemingly feminist-inspired decline of the traditional alpha male, including changing attitudes to sex.“A man must be able to read a woman’s signals, and it’s a good thing that feminism is teaching young men that no means no and yes means yes,” Judge wrote.“But there’s also that ambiguous middle ground, where the woman seems interested and indicates, whether verbally or not, that the man needs to prove himself to her.“And if that man is any kind of man, he’ll allow himself to feel the awesome power, the wonderful beauty, of uncontrollable male passion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/227587bcb84a619d3e1dfa5b0ba7a0b7f1177932/0_5_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=272025c742b17bba92231df55024811b","title":"what brett kavanaugh teaches us about teenage boys and male power","story":"More than 25 years ago, Anita Hill was dismissed as ‘nutty and slutty’ for alleging sexual harassment. Now another supreme court nominee stands accused. Has nothing changed?‘A bit nutty and a bit slutty.” This phrase, used by David Brock in his book The Real Anita Hill, is one I will always remember. Hill was a lawyer, who had acted as an adviser and assistant to the judge Clarence Thomas towards the start of her career she then moved into academe, and when Thomas became a US supreme court nominee in the early 1990s, nominated by the first President Bush, Hill accused Thomas of sexual harassment.In October 1991, in publicly televised hearings, she said that Thomas had asked her out socially when she was working as his assistant. She added that he spoke graphically about his sexual prowess, talked about women having sex with animals and pornographic films that showed group sex or rape scenes apparently, he also once asked “Who has put pubic hair on my coke?” after examining a can on his desk.As the judiciary is a branch of the US government, nominees are, in many ways, forced to behave like political candidates, and it was understood that nominations could be “borked” – defeated by any means necessary – the word coming from the blocking of Robert Bork, another rightwinger, in 1987. When Thomas’s nomination was announced – and the Republicans desperately wanted a black conservative, which he was, in the post – Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, declared: “We’re going to bork him.”This was more than 25 years ago. The culture war is not new we go backwards and forwards, and now have another supreme court nominee and more allegations of a sexual nature. But something is shifting. I remember the Hill hearings being shot through with racial and sexual politics. Was this just another hi–tech lynching of a good black man? Hill was accused of being both too poised and also, devastatingly, of being a sexual being. It was his word against hers. I wrote at the time: “For whatever did or did not happen struck a chord with so many women in particular that they felt that what was being told was some emotional truth beyond the comprehension of men in suits.” Others, of course, wrote that only mad, witchy, rad fems believed her at all the columnist Barbara Amiel said, with typical understament: “It seems fair to say that America today, vis-à-vis feminist thought, is at the point Germany reached before the Nazis took over.” Whoa!I wonder what has happened over the years. I wonder, frankly, at my own reticence in not believing Hill to have not clearly connected the sexual harassment she described to my own. Yes, she is speaking an emotional truth I had said, thinking somehow that that might not be the same as an actual truth.Why? Because my own experience and that of my generation involved tolerating a certain level of harassment, quasi-assault and rape as the price we paid for working, travelling, wanting to have a life, to be independent. I always knew that seeking equality was risky. Stuff would happen to you, sexual stuff, slights and outright harassment, and it was a sign of strength that you didn’t complain. The humiliation was internalised. The shame was shoved down the back of your throat. There was little choice about swallowing or spitting. A lot of women swallowed our hurt, but then we found ourselves regurgitating it, often at inappropriate times. I never liked the word trauma: it seemed too dramatic to describe the things men did, or tried to do, to you. We were taught not to be dramatic.When I read Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation against Donald Trump’s current supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, it stuck in my throat. “With Kavanaugh’s hand over my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me,” she has said. Her allegation is that, back in 1982, at a party, when she was 15 and he was 17, Kavanaugh locked her in a room with his friend Mark Judge. Kavanaugh was on top of her and was trying to get her clothes off. Judge allegedly egged him on, and also told him to stop at various points. Kavanaugh was very drunk. Blasey Ford is now a professor. Since the allegation, Deborah Ramirez, who went to Yale with Kavanaugh, has alleged in the New Yorker magazine that Kavanaugh thrust his penis against her face when they were both drinking at a college party in the early 1980s. Kavanaugh has denied all the allegations and Judge says he never saw Kavanaugh behave in that way.But now another woman, Julie Swetnick, has said she attended “well over 10” house parties in the 80s where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. She said she saw Kavanaugh “engage in abusive and physically aggressive behaviour towards girls, including pressing girls against him without their consent, ‘grinding’ against girls and attempting to remove or shift girls clothing to expose private body parts”. In addition, she says she saw “efforts by Mark Judge, Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ‘gang raped’ in a side room or bedroom by a ‘train’ of numerous boys …” She herself, she went on to say, was gang raped at a party where Kavanaugh and Judge were present. They have yet to respond to these new allegations.The US president, an unrepentant sexual predator, hasn’t been put off by the earlier allegations against his supreme court pick. Trump has not used the phrase “A bit nutty and a bit slutty“ about Blasey Ford because, apart from anything else, he does not read. But he has dismissed the women who have come forward as drunken, politically motivated Democrats.Let’s be clear: Kavanaugh is not accused of rape and is not in court he may simply not get the job he wants. He wants that job badly enough to have gone on Fox News this week, sitting alongside his concerned-looking wife, and telling us that he was in fact a virgin during his high school years – as if this means he has never disrespected women. His somewhat holier-than-thou persona is, of course, at odds with his yearbook entries these involve him and many of his former classmates slut-shaming a woman called Renate (a large number of them referring to themselves as “Renate alumni”) and alluding to his legendary drinking.It is possible that this man engaged in hardcore frat-boy antics, but never did anything bad to any women. Strangely though, all the things he is accused of are performances for other men, a botched show of sexual prowess and potency. The women concerned are vessels to be exchanged in this cementing of male friendship. This is common enough for it to be ordinary. Just a thing guys do. It will be a rare woman who doesn’t experience a shudder of recognition on reading these allegations, and an instant passport to incidents that occurred in their own teenage years.The rhetorical question that keeps being voiced is: “What boy hasn’t done this in high school?” The idea of pinning a girl down against her will and making her feel she may die is apparently thoroughly normal. The answer to this is surely that a lot of boys haven’t, and never would, that it is not OK now and was not OK in the 70s or 80s, an era now spoken of as unwoke compared with the present, where we know what is and is not acceptable.This is patently rubbish. We know that many teenage girls are wearing shorts under their skirts so as not to be groped at school shots from hardcore porn films are now used as screensavers and girls commonly fear being shamed on social media. We know about the incredibly small chance of a rapist being convicted in this country, and the character assassinations of female accusers. We know that some girls are deemed uncredible. In the UK, the police described certain girls in the Rotherham grooming cases as “unrapeable” children who had blood running down their legs.But it is in the US that we more usually see these high-profile rape trials play out, such as that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman. His father said afterwards that his sentence was: “A steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of 20 years of his life.” A brutal sexual assault was reduced to 20 minutes of action. What did that 20 minutes of action take from the woman who was raped? And what was the sentence that was deemed too harsh? A six-month sentence in county jail, of which he served three months.Even if Kavanaugh did the things he is accused of, does it matter all these years later? Is it possible to be out of control as a young man – and perfectly respectful of women as an older one? It probably is, but it woud require a degree of honesty, a glimmer of self-reflection at least. Instead, Kavanaugh is now involved in some peculiar audition before the US public, in which he is presenting himself as the most perfect young man who ever lived.That this pantomime is being performed while we watch another – a zombie-like Bill Cosby, cuffed and unrepentant, finally being taken to prison – is odd, to say the least. It took the testimony of more than 60 women and many years to bring Cosby down, and still we wonder if he is perhaps too old to be imprisoned. At what age is one beyond justice?Kavanaugh’s alleged “crimes” are small fry compared with Cosby’s. Who will judge the judge at the judiciary hearing on Thursday? Other men, it turns out 11 of them, but with “a female assistant” they have hired for the occasion. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Again, in this story as in so many others, women are wives and assistants. In this ideological battle, even the GOP are uneasy. It just may be that, as has been alleged, Kavanaugh insisted his clerks be pretty, that women look a certain way. Trump does the same. It is the way things always were. It is the way they are now emboldened to be again.Stephen King nailed the boys-will-be-boys mantra. He tweeted that Kavanaugh may have drunk hard and partied heavily: “Those behaviours change with age,” he wrote, “but the attitudes and assumptions which drove those behaviours rarely do.” It seems to me perfectly possible that a man who is now a “carpool dad” did what he has been accused of. If sexual assault was only carried out by monsters, it would not be part of most women’s experience of growing up. This is what #MeToo has revealed. Here, then, we get the push back.Interestingly, many conservative women are unhappy with Kavanaugh, too. They are unsure they understand why women don’t always come forward with accusations of rape and assault. The unease comes when experience and belief systems clash. For any women this is difficult it is easier to shut up and shut down about much of this. The #MeToo movement has opened up a conversation about pain ordinary pain, what so many of us accept as just stuff that happens. We don’t want this for our daughters. That much we do know.So, 27 years on from Anita Hill, we are not yet at the stage of believing women because it is still so uncomfortable even to listen to them. Men will decide if this man is fit to sit on the supreme court and make judgments over what women do with their bodies. If appointed, he will be on the supreme court for life.This man says he behaved honourably, while some of his fellow students remember a belligerent drunk. I don’t know if he put his hand over a woman’s mouth while he was on top of her. I do know too well what that feels like though.This is not only about Kavanaugh. It is about the silencing of women while decisions are made for us – and about us. It is about power God forbid the nutty and the slutty – as all women are ultimately perceived – should speak the truth in these televised hearings. Women voters will watch this though. And they will watch, carefully, the men in charge who get to decide who to believe – and who to silence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17021470ae7c2c83f357e6cc357b874e634ebc5b/0_112_4726_2836/master/4726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05d916fa0a57cb61c5f9305bca4f81ec","title":"dutch cyclists face mobile phone ban","story":"Phone ban to be extended to cyclists amid road safety fears in country where bikes outnumber people Using a mobile phone while cycling is to be banned in the Netherlands amid mounting safety fears in a country where bikes outnumber people.A draft law scheduled to take effect next July will extend an existing 2002 ban on car and lorry drivers using their mobile phones at the wheel unless in hands-free mode to “the use of a mobile electronic device while driving any vehicle (including a bicycle)”.The Dutch transport minister, Cora van Nieuwenhuizen checked, said the law was needed because the advent of social media and unlimited mobile data had changed how people used smartphones and the time they spent on them.Cyclists were excluded from the initial ban because of their lower speeds, Van Niewenhuizen said. “But in fact, using a phone is just as dangerous on a bike as it is in a car,” she said. “The fact is that whenever you’re on the road you should be paying full attention and not doing anything at all on a phone.”The increasing popularity of electric bikes meant cyclists’ average speed had risen, the minister added, while the country’s 22,000 miles of cycle lanes and paths had become more crowded.Pedestrians, too, are at risk when they use mobile phones near cyclists: the Dutch town of Bodegraven last year launched a trial of foot-level traffic lights to prevent people wandering on to roads or cycle lanes while glued to their screens.While research suggests the number of cyclists who need emergency care after an accident involving a mobile phone may not be particularly high, less serious accidents have become increasingly common, particularly among young people.One in five bike accidents involving people aged 12 to 25 last year involved a smartphone, according to one estimate. A total of 206 cyclists died in traffic accidents in 2017, according to the central statistics office CBS, 17 more than the previous year.Michael Kulkens, who has campaigned for a ban since his 13-year-old son, Tommy-Boy, was killed in a bike accident while compiling a playlist on his phone for his sister’s birthday party, said he was delighted with the proposed change.“I had to stop my car at the side of the road and the tears welled up in my eyes when I heard on the radio that the ban was coming,” he told De Telegraaf newspaper. “In my mind, I said: ‘We did it Tommy-Boy. We did it.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1fa07a75a17e851740e0b1418a17322cd237e8/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46d3f3079ad688f547bd234951b4f80c","title":"late late show passenger tries to flag down plane at dublin airport","story":"Man arrested for breaking out of departure area to halt Ryanair flight after arriving late Many travellers may recognise the temptation. You arrive at the boarding gate and are told you’re late. The plane’s doors have closed – you’ve missed your flight.But the plane is still there, almost close enough to touch. If you could just get through the door and attract the pilots’ attention maybe somehow, miraculously, it’s not too late.A would-be passenger at Dublin airport succumbed to that fantasy on Thursday morning when he ran out of the departure area at terminal one and tried to flag down his Ryanair flight to Amsterdam.“He was banging on the window to try to get the aircraft to wait and he then broke through a door and made his way on to the apron, trying to flag the aircraft down,” said an airport spokesman.“He was initially restrained by Ryanair staff on the apron and airport police, who had already been contacted, arrived on the scene almost immediately and arrested him.”The man, who was not immediately named, was in his 20s.He arrived late with a female passenger at the boarding gate at about 7am after the flight had closed, said the airport spokesperson. “They were engaging with Ryanair staff at the gate and the male passenger was becoming agitated.”He banged on the window then broke through a door before heading towards the plane. Airport police, who had previously been alerted, arrived swiftly and reportedly pinned him to the ground after a scuffle.He has been arrested and is being detained at Ballymun garda station.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Mexican waves, waspish one-liners, bockety knees, missing dogs and multiple visions to beat the band.A joyous photograph of the President flinging his arms skyward in sync with the crowd at the Liam Miller testimonial match set the early tone for his day. It made everyone smile. It preceded the official start of his campaign for the presidency in a re-election exercise that has been meticulously plotted from a long way out. At least that’s how it looks. He has some operation behind him.After witnessing the 77-year-old candidate’s performance, you’d be afraid for the other five. But for all the high-flown rhetoric, the standing on impressive records and the promises of creative engagements to come, it was Michael D’s personality that shone the strongest. The man who wants to continue as a “President for All of Us” set a precedent for all of them by his assured handling of a potentially difficult public appearance after seven years of being cosseted by the state in Áras an Uachtaráin. In the course of a press conference in his campaign headquarters on Wednesday afternoon, he also revealed that he is doing yoga. At this point, a number of colour writers fell off their chairs and were carried, senseless, from the room. There is no getting over the image. There were some difficult questions to be asked and answered. However, in the very long run-up to the contest proper, Higgins has had lots of time to prepare his answers. He safely sailed through the questions about how the presidency is funded and staying in expensive hotels when travelling abroad on behalf of the nation. Questions about his remarks following the death of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, or the unfair advantage he would seem to have over his rivals were addressed head on. As was the slightly delicate but very relevant topic of his age and how it might impact on his ability to carry out his duties. He was forthcoming and disarming in his replies. On age: “I knew some people, in fact, who were very ancient people when they were chronologically very young. And, tragically, some of them didn’t change.” The claque of supporters at the back of the room burst into applause.He is feeling better than he did seven years ago. “I had my knee done,” he declared, before dropping the yoga bombshell.His headquarters is in a very nice building on Lord Edward Street, not far from Dublin Castle. It was buzzing with staff on Wednesday and the merchandise is ready to roll.He made his first campaign speech with five long Michael D display posters forming a backdrop. One had a message at the top, the next at the bottom and so on. This meant that his head was at different heights in the display, like a whack-a-mole game.The room wasn’t particularly large, which gave the impression that the crowd was absolutely huge. A large number of young supporters took up many of the seats while many faces from his first presidential election campaign were spotted among his team. “As you know, I am now running as an independent candidate in this election.” There wasn’t as much as a bashful titter from all the old Labour party hands scattered around the room. Also there were faces recognisable from the recent marriage equality and abortion referendums.And with this being a big election, with a very definite front-runner and lots of numbers waiting to be crunched, barrister Noel Whelan was a very visible presence. He can’t resist a good election. At least most of the time – Noel flirted with the idea of challenging Michael D for the job but decided against. As journalists assembled for the big reveal, soothing piped music was being piped into the room. The sort of music you hear in places where they talk of “mindfulness” or when a woman is giving birth in a paddling pool in her living room.For Wednesday, and the rest of the month, Michael D Higgins is a mere commoner. Except when he is the President. He says he will be able to juggle both these roles for the duration of the campaign. Then again, it must be difficult for others when their main rival arrived in a Merc with a Garda driver and everyone goes quiet because he is the First Citizen. And he has a couple of plainclothes detectives standing watch wherever he goes. On Wednesday, the crowd even went quiet before he came into his own launch. “Shhhh!” said somebody as he was about to appear and nobody said a word when he ambled in with Sabina. He looked slightly taken aback, as if he had been expecting a noisy reception. The good navy three-piece suit was on for the occasion along with the paisley tie from the election poster. His campaign colours are green merging into blue. Blue is the official colour of Ireland. The only concession to his Labour past is the bright red Michael D full stop.He was asked what he thought of the candidate Peter Casey’s insinuation that the incident in the Áras last Friday – where a woman (hardly an intruder) drove up the drive through the open front gate, parked outside his front door and went in for a chat – was a maybe a bit more than a coincidence. After explaining, gently, “in fairness to the woman involved” that it was no big deal and he wished her well “and that’s how it should be, how else should it be?”, he made a stinging little remark about businessman Casey. “Maybe that candidate is not too long back from America.”Then a complicated question about whether he has an unfair advantage over his rivals led to this quip to reporter Gavan Reilly: “I think you have more than a double hypothesis there and you might have managed a treble...”He was ready for every question. He has been doing his homework. His speech was short and he kept saying he wanted to be brief. We’ll see how long that lasts. Michael D is strong on the vision guff: “In marking each act of nation-building, I also hope to spark a renewed sense of collective vision-making.” But it is guff of the highest quality. He is also “going to build on the ethics of memory” by “making sure that an event of the past doesn’t rob you of the opportunities of the present and doesn’t deprive you of the imaginative futures that you construct together”. He will be very difficult to topple. Unless he topples himself, his rivals have their work cut out for them. There was only one disappointment at the launch. “I wish he had brought his dogs. I want to see more of the dogs,” sighed a youthful member of the team when it was over.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3610086.1537992437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up and running presidential candidates kick off their campaigns","story":"It appears likely that voters will have six candidates to choose from on October 26th.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe .Nominations for the presidential election officially closed at noon on Wednesday, with six candidates on the official ballot paper.Within hours of the nominations closing, the campaigns of all six candidates were fully under way, with the incumbent, President Michael D Higgins, launching his campaign in Dublin city centre on Wednesday afternoon.In a late effort, a seventh potential candidate, journalist Gemma O’Doherty, tried to persuade 20 members of the Oireachtas to support her nomination before the noon deadline.However, in a tweet Ms O’Doherty disclosed she had received the backing of 11 TDs and Senators: Joan Collins, Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Catherine Connolly, Michael Fitzmaurice, Seán Canney, Tommy Broughan, Séamus Healy, Maureen O’Sullivan, Mattie McGrath and Rónán Mullen.It is understood that a small number of others might have been willing to sign her nomination paper but were not in a position to do so before the deadline.The first broadcast debate of the campaign will take place today on RTÉ’s News at One but neither President Higgins nor Seán Gallagher will be taking part.The Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada’s posters began appearing throughout the State yesterday, but without her party’s logo.Asked about the absence of the logo on the posters, she told RTÉ that while she was honoured to be a Sinn Féin candidate, she wanted to be a “president for all the people”.She said the absence of a reference to her party represented a “fresh approach and a new approach”.Under repeated questioning on Drivetime about her comments about the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer (for teenage girls), she said she fully supported the vaccine but refused to ulge if her own teenage daughters had received it, citing their rights to privacy.The businessman Peter Casey, in a separate interview, said his suggestion that an incident involving an intruder in Áras an Uachtaráin was a stunt was said “tongue-in-cheek” but he added: “Seven years without a security breach and then we have one a week before an election campaign.”Seán Gallagher told the broadcaster that he had spent the past seven years starting a family, rebuilding his own life, focusing on business and writing for The Sunday Independent.“Over the last seven years I have been involved in many substantial issues. I am not always tweeting and they are not always in the public eye,” he said.There have been questions raised during the campaign about Mr Gallagher’s absence from public life in the past seven years.Gavin Duffy defended a plan he had to set up a programme that would have young people aged between 18 and 25 involved in an “Irish corps” and work on aid and projects in the developing world.The election will take place on October 26th with the new president being inaugurated on November 11th.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

It\u0027s a natural thing to use.Landscape is nature. The previous window put up in here was also nature, lilies.It\u0027s a rather celebratory thing. It\u0027s the height of the spring and summer.The artist said of the window\u0027s Westminster Abbey home: I know this is a historic place and I know it\u0027s going to last.Hockney once said that he turned down the chance to paint the Queen because he was very busy painting England actually, her country.He said of designing his first stained glass window: I learnt something about glass. It was a challenge.The artist said of Westminster Abbey: I know this is a historic place and I know it\u0027s going to last.Asked whether he had any response to the window from the Queen, who has seen a sketch and will see the real thing when she visits Westminster Abbey in November, said: Not yet, but I hope she\u0027ll like it. I\u0027m sure she will.” he said: Not yet but I hope she\u0027ll like it. I\u0027m sure she will.Westminster Abbey said that the result reflects the Queen as a countrywoman and her widespread delight in, and yearning for, the countryside.The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, said: I\u0027m excited by it.I think there\u0027s absolutely no harm at all in having something which is particular and vibrant and different.Some of the glass here is not very good. Some of it is not too bad, but this has a wonderful, beautiful, easily accessible vibrant colour. I think people will enjoy it.He added: It\u0027s going to be here until the end. Who knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future.Hockney, 81, is one of Britain\u0027s most-loved artists and famous for his Yorkshire landscapes and paintings of Californian life.Barley Studio, a stained glass studio based in York, created the window using traditional techniques.Please review our commenting policyAustralia state broadcaster chair resigns after denying government meddling in ABCFears for beluga whale as it swims towards London on third day in ThamesDavid Beckham posts \u0026#39angry\u0026#39 selfie stuck in London traffic while absent from his speeding trialIndia\u0026#39s top court rules adultery no longer a crimeGlobal drive to tackle huge regional disparities in childhood cancer survival launchedNo more suffering in silence: the teenager who got politicians talking about periodsSign up to the \u0026#39s Conservative Party Conference WhatsApp updates for all the latest news, exclusives and analysisLondon fire chief reveals she has Grenfell \u0026#39memory blanks\u0026#39 and has had counselling to improve recallTrump says China has total respect for his very, very large brainTheresa May rebukes Tory deputy chairman for asking if she consults her husband Philip for adviceSkripal \u0026#39hitman\u0026#39 unmasked as GRU colonel awarded Russia\u0026#39s highest military honour by Vladimir PutinTrump praises \u0026#39beautiful\u0026#39 letter from Kim as he relaxes nuclear weapons demandsDoctor Who: The Woman Who Fell To Earth reviews: what do the critics think of Jodie Whittaker\u0026#39s Time Lord?Trump would \u0026#39prefer\u0026#39 to keep top official in Russia probe as president set for Rod Rosenstein showdownHow popular is Donald Trump?

The Treasury said Mr Hammond will “will set out the government’s plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy, building on the recent Spring Statement and last year’s Budget”.The chancellor’s report on the state of the economy comes earlier than usual this year, and will fall before an emergency Brexit summit scheduled for November.According to previous reports, the reason for bringing the Budget forward is so the Finance Bill can pass through parliament before any potential Brexit legislation is presented before MPs. Bringing the Budget forward could be great for the economyHammond hints he will scrap freeze on fuel duty in looming BudgeHammond should seize opportunity presented by budget surplus This is only the second autumn Budget, since Mr Hammond announced in 2016, shortly after he was appointed, that he was abolishing the long-held tradition of delivering the annual government Budget in March. He said that the Budget would instead be held in the Autumn, around the time that the Autumn Statement, previously the second fiscal event of the year, was held.At the time, Mr Hammond said he was making the timetable changes because “no other major economy makes hundreds of tax changes twice a year, and neither should we”.The government recently recorded the biggest budget surplus for the month of July in 18 years, leading to calls for an end to austerity in the UK.Mr Hammond has already hinted that he will scrap the eight-year freeze on fuel duty in the Budget, telling MPs the impact of the policy must be “looked at again”.He said the freeze had saved the average car driver £850 and the average van driver more than £2,100.\u0026nbspHowever, he added: It is important that we remember the other side of this coin, the fuel duty freezes since 2011 have meant the Exchequer has foregone around £46bn in revenues through to 2018-19 - and a further £38bn will be foregone over the budget forecast period as a result of these previously announced freezes.“For context, this is about twice as much as we spend on all NHS nurses and doctors each year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Hence the cheering from the sadly limited number of people in Theresa May’s Britain that have sufficient spare cash to salt some away.\u0026nbspAnother point in the account’s favour is that it is a truly mass market product, available to anyone aged 18 and above with a minimum deposit of just £1.\u0026nbspSing it loud, sing it proud: Let’s go Goldman’s! Or should that be: Let’s go Marcus! \u0026nbsp“There is a real disillusionment about savings,” said Marcus MD Des McDaid. “We want to reverse the trend - literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Get you to Saville Row to have a pair of underpants fitted that you can wear above your suit Des! You’re the new savings Superman!\u0026nbsp“More competition in the savings market is sorely needed,” said Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform in response.\u0026nbspJust how true that statement is can been seen if you consider one of the numbers put out by Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s biggest retail bank.\u0026nbspNet interest margin is, in simple, terms the difference between what borrowers pay and what savers are paid. At Lloyds it hit a low of 1.91 per cent in the second quarter of 2012. In the early part of 2018, however, it had improved to a balmy 2.93 per cent.\u0026nbspNow the number encompasses\u0026nbspall of the various ways Lloyds funds its various lending activities (so corporate deposits, current accounts, wholesale funding etc). It isn’t limited to retail savings accounts and loans.\u0026nbspBut you don’t get to juice your margins like that when you’re operating in a vibrantly competitive savings market.\u0026nbspSo yay Goldman. Up to a point. Because you won\u0027t be surprised to learn that, this being banking, there is\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspcatch.For a start, as Suter points out, the account pays\u0026nbspjust 0.09 per cent more than current table-topper Yorkshire Building Society, good for an extra 90p a year for someone with £1,000 on deposit. Some people might think it’s worth giving that up to save with a building society they own a piece of in preference to Goldman. ​Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The offered rate is around three times better than the average rate among existing accounts available to savers. The banking giant said the account is “transparent, secure, and easy to use”. It launched for Goldman Sachs employees in August, and is now available to UK residents over the age of 18. Savers can deposit from £1 to £250,000. Which banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Business groups warn interest rate hike poses threat to UK economyGoldman Sachs launches retail bank Marcus in UKDes McDaid, managing director at Marcus by Goldman Sachs said: “Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We’ve spoken in-depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings –\u0026nbspwhile most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame.“We want to reverse the trend – literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Mr McDaid added: “We’ve made the Marcus Online Savings Account as easy as possible to open and manage online, and with our aim to offer a consistently competitive interest rate, we hope our customers will see the benefits – and how, over time, this can add up to help them get to their saving goals that bit quicker.”Goldman Sachs hired 150 extra staff this year ahead of the launch of Marcus. Shakila Hashmi, head of money at Compare the Market, said: “Goldman Sachs’ entrance into the mainstream of retail banking should be good news for savers. The rate offered on its first UK savings account is around three times more generous than the average savings accounts from the major players. As such, we would expect a high degree of interest in switches to the Marcus account in the coming weeks.“Our hope is that this is a catalyst for other banks to offer better rates to their customers. The effect it will have on competition is not simply that of another new player coming into the market and offering an attractive rate Goldman Sachs is a well-known name, albeit an unlikely one in the retail banking space.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound.

In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months. Flights grounded if UK leaves EU with no air deal, ministers admitAccepting Brexit is like happily paying for a meal you never receivedTory Brexiteers are peddling another fantasy with Canada deal ideaHowever, the company said: “The flip side of this reduction in currency risk is that our pricing will not improve until January 2020 if the pound strengthens against the dollar in the coming months.The retailer’s plans were laid out in a lengthy trading update for the first half of the year, which showed total sales rose 3.8 per cent, to £1.97bn, boosted by a 17 per cent hike in online sales\u0026nbspwhich offset a 7 per cent drop in retail. The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m. Next shares were up 8 per cent in early trading.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: ““The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

My understanding of the inclusion of socks in the regulations has always been that dark socks must be worn as opposed to brightly coloured ones, not that socks are categorically required, an assumption which clearly turned out to be incorrect.\u0026nbspMy view is that this makes the dress code inherently skewed so that men adhere to the regulations automatically, since men\u0027s shoes are always worn with socks, whereas women need to think carefully about whether an otherwise conventionally smart women\u0027s outfit conforms to the university rules.Eleanor Broome, who studied French at the Russell Group university, said she was also refused entry to her graduation ceremony in July for not wearing socks.Her ceremony was delayed by 15 minutes while students and their family and friends waited for her to come back.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn delivers a keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in LiverpoolDerby County manager leads the celebrations with players in front of their fans after winning a penalty shootout against Manchester United in the third round of the Carabao Cup.

The information will be presented in graphs, and users are offered the ability to ban themselves from specific apps, for instance.But those charts – intended as a way of allowing people to better control their use of their phone – have turned out to be more than a little horrifying to many users. Many appear to have used their last few minutes of available time to tweet about just how miserable their incessant tweeting is making them.Others embraced ignorance as a way of avoiding the horrifying graphs.Many found, however that the feature is actually working – despite or perhaps because of the feelings of shame. The feature was introduced by Apple as a way of allowing people to use their phone for what they actually want to do, which appears to be paying off.One important group affected by the changes are children. Apple allows the Screen Time feature to be controlled within families – meaning, for instance, that parents can set limits for their children, who can ask for more time if they need it.Screen Time is just one of a vast range of features introduced in iOS 12, Apple\u0027s latest iPhone update. They also include other features intended on improving people\u0027s relationship with their phone, including alterations to the way notifications work.The feature should nudge users into using it when the latest update is installed. But if not it can be found by heading into the Settings app, scrolling down to Screen Time, and following the instructions that are found there.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The name is demure the scene, not so much – at least not once they pass the parking lot, the man checking tickets at the front gate and the dim corridor at whose far end blazes a rectangle of bronze sand and sea.Hijabs are unwound from heads, veils tugged from faces. Jeans and abayas evaporate, ulging string bikinis, tankinis and swim shorts. Under spindly cabanas by azure waves, two women lie chest down on lounge chairs, their bare backs implying bare fronts. All around them, gallons of tanning oil glistens on acres of copper skin.When a man on a jet ski buzzes past, a female lifeguard warns him off with a staccato of whistle blasts.“Men,” says Nada, a school bus supervisor from Beirut who was treading the Mediterranean just offshore, “are suffocating.In Lebanon, a sliver of a country on the Mediterranean coast where summer sticks to your skin like moist Saran wrap, the beach is less a luxury than a utility. It is hard to imagine going without.Public and pay-by-the-day beaches line the coast from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north, and every other billboard on the highways out of Beirut seems to display a bikini model promoting a tanning aid\u0026nbsp(SPF, evidently, is not in style).But many observant Muslim women consider it haram – forbidden – to expose their bodies in front of men who are not their husbands or, in some cases, close relatives. Other women may cover themselves in deference to conservative families and communities.For them, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoided those who go with their families roast in the sun fully clothed in hijabs and long-sleeved shirts and pants or abayas, the full-length caftans popular among devout Lebanese Muslim women.Hence the emergence of ladies’ beaches like this one, the Bellevue Beach Club in the seaside town of Jiyeh – a salt-tinged hiatus from the male gaze for $18 (£14) a day, just 20 minutes down a trash-perfumed highway from Beirut.AFPGetty)It is a dedicated patch of sand for conservative women amid the cultural melange of Lebanon, which, with its 18 recognised religious sects and vigorous all-night party scene, tends to be more socially liberal than other Arab countries.At the Bellevue, there seemed to be as many different degrees of scanty cladding as there were women. For some women, religious scruples argued for more coverage. For others, style considerations, and the heat, argued for less. Each woman had made her own peace with the proportions.“Here, I’m free to be me,” says Rabab Amhaz, 35, a housewife from the inland Bekaa Valley. She gestures\u0026nbspto her tankini, bright with a teal floral pattern, and shimmies\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspthe water.Seeking a second opinion on her beach visit, she had consulted her brother, a Hezbollah fighter. He had not only given her his blessing but shown her a YouTube video of a Muslim cleric explaining that swimwear was acceptable among women, so long as the women covered their lower bodies.Nada, who began wearing the veil when she married at age 14, dismisses\u0026nbspthis assessment: you could find a cleric to say anything you wanted, she says.Following her own strong conviction that all the skin on display around her was forbidden (who knew who might be watching from one of the boats that periodically splashed by, or from behind the walls of the resort?),\u0026nbspshe had looked at herself in the mirror that morning and changed into a more modest bottom. She also declined to reveal her last name to a reporter, preferring to avoid the prospect of disapproval at home.But a swimsuit was a swimsuit – in this case, a black-and-white patterned swim tank with black shorts.Created with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

Sara wants to be able to contribute to a society by becoming a doctor to help others“When you see me on Facebook, I look completely different,” she says, her hair loose and ropy in the water. “You wouldn’t recognise me.”After next year, when she plans\u0026nbspto make the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim who can afford it is supposed to undertake at least once, she says she would avoid even the ladies’ beach she, like many women who have completed the hajj, will\u0026nbspadopt more modest attire.And she frowns\u0026nbspon the women who have\u0026nbspbrought their young sons, who are allowed up to age 8 on the beach. She does\u0026nbspnot want her sons or grandsons to get used to seeing women’s bodies.But still. “I love to swim,” she says, smiling and shrugging, “so I have no other choice.”Nada and Amhaz agree\u0026nbspon one point: absolutely no beach selfies, not even to share with their husbands.“No, no!” they exclaim, high-fiving.Cameras are banned, the better to protect the beachgoers’ modesty and privacy, though cellphones are not. But visits to several other Lebanese resorts, undertaken purely for journalistic purposes, suggest\u0026nbspfew other differences between women-only beaches and mixed ones beyond the obvious.No matter the setting, gossip and hookah pipes scent the air. Snacks, water and shade are at a premium. People-watching is frequently rewarding.Several ladies’ beaches fringe the coastline south of Beirut, their names redolent of sandy glamour around the world (the Laguna the Bondi). The Bellevue Beach Club began offering women-only days in the mid-1990s after veiled women began asking for privacy.Business was good – better than on mixed days, even. It soon went all women, all the time.A man collects tickets, but no other males are allowed. Women staff the restrooms and the pool. The staff includes the Australian and Filipino wives of the brothers who run the Bellevue, who go to mixed beaches together.There is a female DJ for the thatch-roofed poolside cabana where beachgoers undulate, hips exuberantly swaying\u0026nbspto Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel Wahab and Lebanese singer Maya Yazbek.Lebanon, where people from different sects share offices, neighbourhoods and businesses, and crop tops can outnumber hijabs in some Beirut neighbourhoods, might seem like a natural inventor of the ladies’ beach. But women-only hours at the pool or the beach are common in other parts of the Middle East, too, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, where dress codes for local women are more uniformly conservative.At the Bellevue, there are\u0026nbspno religious strictures on swim attire but each woman’s own.Nada’s 21-year-old daughter wears modest gym clothing when she goes to mixed beaches with her husband at the Bellevue, she wore a bikini top with a short swim skirt. She had brought a Syrian friend who, taken aback at the way the other beachgoers dressed, kept a tank top on.Piles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisSteven Spielberg\u0027s The Post banned in LebanonHow to spend a weekend in BeirutThen there was Rana Ghalayini, a nurse from Beirut who had first put on the veil when she was 12, only to remove it because her family thought she was too young. When she married at 23, she and her husband agreed that she should be veiled. But she had resolved to keep her three young daughters unveiled until they, too, were 23.“Religion is broad,” she says. “It’s a personal choice.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The offered rate is around three times better than the average rate among existing accounts available to savers. The banking giant said the account is “transparent, secure, and easy to use”. It launched for Goldman Sachs employees in August, and is now available to UK residents over the age of 18. Savers can deposit from £1 to £250,000. Which banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Business groups warn interest rate hike poses threat to UK economyGoldman Sachs launches retail bank Marcus in UKDes McDaid, managing director at Marcus by Goldman Sachs said: “Over the last decade savers have been on the wrong end of low interest rates. We’ve spoken in-depth to people across the country and there is a real disillusionment about savings –\u0026nbspwhile most UK adults are diligently trying to save every month, some do not even have a savings account, with low interest rates and complexity being put to blame.“We want to reverse the trend – literally putting the interest back into savings and make saving worthwhile again.”Mr McDaid added: “We’ve made the Marcus Online Savings Account as easy as possible to open and manage online, and with our aim to offer a consistently competitive interest rate, we hope our customers will see the benefits – and how, over time, this can add up to help them get to their saving goals that bit quicker.”Goldman Sachs hired 150 extra staff this year ahead of the launch of Marcus. Shakila Hashmi, head of money at Compare the Market, said: “Goldman Sachs’ entrance into the mainstream of retail banking should be good news for savers. The rate offered on its first UK savings account is around three times more generous than the average savings accounts from the major players.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. UK retail sales better than expected in AugustAccording to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months. Flights grounded if UK leaves EU with no air deal, ministers admitAccepting Brexit is like happily paying for a meal you never receivedTory Brexiteers are peddling another fantasy with Canada deal ideaHowever, the company said: “The flip side of this reduction in currency risk is that our pricing will not improve until January 2020 if the pound strengthens against the dollar in the coming months.The retailer’s plans were laid out in a lengthy trading update for the first half of the year, which showed total sales rose 3.8 per cent, to £1.97bn, boosted by a 17 per cent hike in online sales\u0026nbspwhich offset a 7 per cent drop in retail. The group now expects retail sales to account for less than half of group sales for the year in full. Pre-tax profit edged up by 0.5 per cent to £311m.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s not reasonable to expect that this continues\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsThe biggest star in Conservative local government has embarrassed Theresa May on the eve of her party conference, by demanding an end to austerity.Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor, sided with council leaders, head teachers and the police, by declaring “The cuts have gone far enough”.The mayor also raised the prospect of the Tories forcing Ms May out of Downing Street after Brexit day next March, saying, of her chances of survival: “I think it is too soon to say.”Brexit wasn\u0027t caused by austerity, and here\u0027s the proofThe comments, in an interview with the Birmingham Mail, come just three days before Conservatives gather in Birmingham for what could be a make-or-break\u0026nbspconference.They will be greeted with delight by Labour, after Jeremy Corbyn’s party made the pain for public services from continuing spending cuts a centrepiece of its conference week.In past years, Ms May and other senior Tories have – when visiting Birmingham - lauded Mr Street, a winner over Labour last year, as a symbol of their successful fightback in local government.But, in the interview, he echoed Labour council and police leaders by saying: “It is right to say that the cuts have gone far enough. It’s not reasonable to expect that this continues.”Mr Street joins other Conservatives who have been clamouring for an end to austerity, with growing warnings that prisons, housing and public health are also facing further cuts.On Friday, around 1,000 head teachers from across England will march on Westminster, before handing in a protest letter at the Treasury to highlight a crisis in schools.Although the prime minister announced an extra £20bn a year for the NHS by 2023-24 – without saying how it will be funded – the chancellor, in March, rejected the calls for a change of course.Next month, Philip Hammond will announce the spending totals for the next three years, but his growth forecasts remain low and he has warned of more cuts if there is a no-deal Brexit.Mr Street backed the prime minister’s Chequers proposals as still the best route through the Brexit logjam – but admitted she, personally, only had his support “at the moment”.While Corbyn spoke for the many, May promised low corporation taxesUK will be \u0027unequivocally pro-business\u0027 after Brexit, May saysTheresa May urges international crackdown on chemical weapons useAsked if Ms May should stand down once Brexit takes place, he replied: “I think it is too soon to say. If the Prime Minister pulls off a good deal, if the party unites behind it, it will move on to implementing that deal.”On the post-Brexit challenges, he added: “It is far too soon to judge who should be leading through that.“At the moment, I’m four-square behind the prime minister as leader of our party.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Everyone is waiting to see how the Tory conference will pan out next week – will they even be negotiating with May by the end of the year?On the eve of the Salzburg summit it looked like a deal on the Irish border might be closer\u0026nbspfor months it had been the main sticking point. But just as compromise seemed close on Ireland, the future relationship issue has reared its head again and looks intractable.\u0026nbspTo those in Brussels the UK’s moves in negotiations appear inexplicable, offering terms that have already been ruled out well in advance.For a deal on the future relationship, the prime minister would have to back down completely and either ditch her red lines and go for a Norway-style, close relationship, or accept she’s only going to get a Canada-style free trade agreement. But she lacks political room for manoeuvre in Westminster and dug herself in even further on Tuesday, effectively ruling out the only offer on the table from the EU.The EU does not really see this as a negotiation: one clued-up Brussels observer described the EU’s approach to me as Britain’s “managed capitulation”. It summarises the situation\u0026nbspwell: for progress to be made Ms May would have to accept that Chequers is dead – as everyone in Brussels already sees it.But there seems to be no sign of that happening. The prime minister said it was unacceptable for the EU to reject her plan without offering a counter-offer, but the response in Brussels is simple: “Or what?”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain\u0027s \u0027managed capitulation\u0027The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, ‘Canada-style’ trade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a ‘Norway-style EEA deal’ – effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexit-y people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal, which is supported by more than 835,000 people who have signed our petition.The former home secretary, who resigned over the Windrush scandal, put herself among “about 40” Tories opposed to a Canada-type deal, more than enough to defeat it, in alliance with opposition parties.May

on to manufacturing that I think we can make those arguments.”The prime minister has continued to ramp up the threat of a no-deal Brexit as the only alternative to her Chequers proposals – which have been rejected outright by EU leaders.Last month, Nick Boles, a former Tory minister warned party hardliners that their “dream” of a no-deal Brexit would be blocked by at least 40 fellow Conservatives.And The Independent revealed in June that they could use a “humble address” – the tactic Labour used to force the government to release Brexit economic assessments – to prevent it.Meanwhile, Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary, told the same programme that Jeremy Corbyn’s conference speech did amount to Labour “bending” its red lines on Brexit.In the address, the Labour leader said he would back a deal brought back by the prime minister if it kept the UK in a customs union and protected jobs, workers’ rights and environmental standards.Mr Corbyn did not mention the “six tests” previously set out by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, which demanded the “exact same benefits” as the test for backing an agreement.Mr Gardiner said: “All of us don’t want the no deal that will take us off the edge of that cliff.“And if it means compromising, if it means you bending your red line to give us a customs union, we’re prepared to bend our red lines to give, to give this a deal.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and

This means goods can then travel freely once they are within the EU.The countries also agree not to impose tariffs on goods travelling between countries in the union.New Brexit referendum better than no-deal, senior Tory Rudd saysThe agreement greatly reduces administrative and financial barriers to trade.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA customs union is different from a free trade area, in which means no tariffs are charged on goods and services moving within the area.\u0026nbspThe single market is a broader agreement that encompasses the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.It could result in increased border checks, which could wreak havoc on supply chains.\u0026nbspMany businesses, such as those in the car industry, operate just-in-time production, with multiple parts crossing the Channel from mainland Europe each day.\u0026nbspHonda UK told MPs in November 2017 that it relied on 350 trucks arriving from the continent every day. A delay of 15 minutes at its Swindon factory would cost £850,000, the company estimated.Countries such as Norway and Switzerland enjoy tariff-free access to the EU without being part of the customs union but accept free movement of workers and make contributions to the EU budget.If the UK restricts the free movement of people with immigration controls it is unlikely to be granted completely tariff-free access to the single market. The cost of doing business will, therefore, rise.The UK could negotiate a free trade deal with the EU, as Canada has recently done. This means the UK would have access to the single market to sell its products but would not be part of it. Therefore, it would not have to sign up to free movement of people. While the deal with Canada removes the vast majority of tariffs there are some significant exceptions, particularly in the services sector – the dominant part of the UK economy.Around a quarter of Northern Ireland’s exports go south, while the Republic sends just 2 per cent of its goods north.So exiting the customs union would impact the Northern Irish economy.Government sees off pro-EU Tory rebels to win vote on customs unionBut it would also increase the likelihood of a hard border returning to\u0026nbspIreland, undermining the Good Friday Agreement.In the orce agreement reached between the UK and EU in December, Britain promised that “no new regulatory barriers” would emerge between the mainland and Northern Ireland.But the Government has yet to spell out exactly how it would perform the necessary checks on goods entering Northern Ireland without erecting a physical barrier with the south.\u0026nbspAround 43\u0026nbspper cent of Britain’s exports go to the EU, according to the Office of National Statistics. They would likely be subject to import tariffs as well as extra administrative costs.If the UK did not negotiate a\u0026nbsptrade deal with the EU before Brexit, it would have to trade on standard tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules.An analysis by The Independent found that the cost to Britain’s exporters -\u0026nbspin extra tariffs alone -\u0026nbspwould be at least £4.5bn per year. This estimate does not include the difficult-to-measure costs of non-tariff barriers, such as the enforcement of different market standards and regulations.The extra costs on companies could force them to relocate UK operations within the EU after Brexit, potentially leading to job cuts.The main positive highlighted by Brexiteers is that Britain would be free to negotiate its own trade deals with non-EU countries.Opponents of this argument have pointed out that countries such as Turkey are in a customs union with the EU that excludes certain sectors and are free to negotiate trade deals.Liam Fox, the\u0026nbspinternational trade secretary, has touted China’s economic expansion\u0026nbspas a reason to prioritise the UK’s ability to strike deals around the world.This could allow the lowering of barriers elsewhere to help to make up for any loss of trade with the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EU Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.workers sorting radishes on a production line at a farm in Norfolk.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.However, trade deals take a long time to negotiate. The UK would also be in a\u0026nbspfar less advantageous negotiating position on its own.Being the world’s largest economic trading bloc with 500 million relatively wealthy consumers gives the EU hefty clout, which the UK alone cannot match.The second positive put forward is that the country would not have to contribute as much to the\u0026nbspEU’s budget.European officials have mooted charging an annual fee if the UK wants access to EU markets to buy and sell its products but remain\u0026nbspoutside the customs union.Norway is set to pay £140 per head for its access to the single market between 2015 and 2020. The UK currently pays £220, according to analysis by fact-checking organisation\u0026nbspFull Fact.The Brexit referendum asked voters to choose between remaining in the EU or leaving it – and was not a question of whether Britain would remain in the customs union.But both Labour and the Tories have committed to leaving the current trading pact after Brexit.\u0026nbspThere are examples of countries that are in a customs union with the EU while not being a member state.Turkey, Andorra and San Marino have customs union agreements with the EU but are not part of the single market. These agreements only cover certain goods. Turkey’s agreement with the EU for example, excludes agricultural products, services and public procurement.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.In practice, it is possible to be outside the customs union but still have access to the single market, as Norway is. This means it can negotiate its own trade deals but has to accept free movement of people and must comply with EU legislation.Labour says its policy on Brexit has been “evolving”.The party is split between those who favour remaining in the single market and those who say the UK must leave, with 80 senior figures warning Mr Corbyn that leaving the single market could scupper his efforts to ease austerity.Last summer Labour announced it was backing an extended “transitional” period after Brexit that would keep existing ties to both the single market and customs union.And the party appears to have shifted towards remaining part of a customs union,\u0026nbsptoo.The Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said Labour had “long championed being in a customs union with the EU and the benefits”.He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works “jointly with the EU”Theresa May’s government has insisted that Britain must leave the customs union and single market if it is to honour the June 2016 referendum.But critics say the simple inout question does not provide a mandate for cutting ties with Britain’s most important trading partners.And some of those on the Brexit side of the argument promised before the vote that Brexit did not mean exiting those arrangements.“Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our place in the single market,” Daniel Hannan, a Tory MEP , said when the referendum was first announced.“No one has ever suggested in Brussels, and I have been here for 16 years, that if we withdrew from the union we would be excluded from the single market.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And what are the options for the country’s relationship with Europe if it exists outside that market?The European single market is the most ambitious part of the whole “European project”. It aims to break down all barriers to trading across the 500 million-person area by ensuring the “four freedoms”, sacrosanct to Brussels policymakers: free movement of goods, services, capital and – most controversially -\u0026nbsplabour.As an\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbspmember, the UK has signed up to each of those freedoms which, as Brussels has repeatedly made clear, are non-negotiable.Being part of the single market gives UK businesses unfettered access to 500 million customers in all states within it and in turn allows UK consumers and companies to purchase goods and services from across the continent. It eliminates tariffs and reduces costs and administrative burdens by applying one set of rules across all member states.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The prime minister has repeatedly said\u0026nbspthe UK will not maintain full access to the customs union but has so far been unable to secure\u0026nbspan agreement on what form the new relationship might take.No. The single market is governed by reams of legislation that aims to harmonise rules on everything from maximum working hours to what tackling climate change. Contrary to popular myth, no EU rule has ever banned excessively curved bananas\u0026nbsp(though standards for fruit quality are laid out in Commission Regulation 225794).Without following unified standards, the single market ceases to be a single market as any one country can implement their own rules.\u0026nbspIt is possible to stay in the single market but be outside of the customs union, as the European Economic Area countries (Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein) do. This allows them to negotiate their own trade deals and to opt out of some legislation, notably fishing quotas. However, they still have to implement all EU laws relating to the operation of the single market, including free movement of people.A huge 44 per cent of Britain’s exports go to the EU – £220bn out of £510bn – according to the Office of National Statistics. If the UK did not negotiate a favourable trade deal with the EU, those exports would be subject to import tariffs as well as extra administrative costs.In the period before any new deal was implemented, the UK would probably have to trade on standard tariffs under World Trade Organisation rules.An analysis by\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspfound that the cost to Britain’s exporters – in extra tariffs alone -\u0026nbspwould be at least £4.5bn per year. This conservative estimate does not include the difficult-to-measure costs of non-tariff barriers, such as the enforcement of different market standards and regulations.It is possible for the UK to have\u0026nbspaccess\u0026nbspto the single market without being a member of it, or being part of the customs union. The UK could negotiate a deal with the EU that allows access to trade freely with the bloc. The EU has 56 free trade agreements with countries around the world, and is in the process of negotiating several more.What is the customs union and what would leaving it mean?On the face of it, this sounds like the option most amenable to many Leave voters, but it is not the simple solution it may first appear.First, when negotiating the terms of that deal, the power balance is tipped heavily in the favour of the EU – the biggest customs union in the world by economic output. Therefore it is likely that the UK would have to agree to adhere to most of the rules that apply as a member state if it wants to trade with it. As a non-EU member it would lose the ability to influence that legislation.Ms May’s has previously warned\u0026nbspthat it would be a “calamitous act of self-harm” for the EU to scupper a free trade pact with the UK by pushing for punitive terms. As the smaller partner, it is likely the UK would be more damaged.\u0026nbspIn addition, such deals can take years to negotiate as all EU member states have to agree to any deal. The recent\u0026nbspEU-Canada trade deal\u0026nbsptook seven years to agree.Once implemented, the UK’s imports to the single market would still have to adhere to a lot of that much-maligned and misunderstood “red tape”.What are the positives about leaving the single market and customs union?The main change would be that the UK would not have to sign up to the free movement of labour.\u0026nbspImmigration\u0026nbsphas been the most isive Brexit issue of all and clearly a large number of people voted to leave in order to see it reduced.Others have pointed out that large parts of the economy and the NHS\u0026nbspare hugely reliant on inward migration.Outside the EU, the country would have the power to limit the number of migrants entering the country. The government has given little detail as to how it would deal with immigration to ensure that businesses can still recruit people with the skills they need.A “points-based” system has repeatedly been mooted, though there are scant examples from other countries of this working effectively in practice.The UK will also not have to follow some EU laws, but it will have to sign up to many standards if it wants access to the single market via a trade agreement.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The latest data marks the third consecutive month of decline in car manufacturing, with production for the UK dropping 39 per cent, while cars built for export fell by 3.8 per cent, and accounted for 82 per cent of total output. Production has decreased by 5 per cent for the year so far, compared with this time last year. The SMMT said exports are still shoring up demand - while just 194,887 cars were built for the domestic market in the first eight months of the year (down 19 per cent on 2017), almost 850,000 were shipped abroad. No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsUK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitMike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said: ““The quieter summer months are often subject to fluctuations due to the variable timing and duration of annual maintenance and re-tooling shutdowns. This instability was exacerbated in August, with the industry racing to recertify entire model ranges to meet tougher testing standards in force on 1 September. “With exports, the majority to the EU, continuing to drive demand, it underscores the importance of a Brexit agreement to safeguard this trade for our sector, ‘no deal’ is not an option.”The SMMT has previously said that a no-deal Brexit must be ruled out because of the threat it poses to the UK motor industry.Figures compiled by the SMMT show that a cliff-edge Brexit could mean at least £5bn in tariffs.However, the organisation said, this would be just the tip of the iceberg for the sector, as these levies could push the cost of UK-built cars sold in the EU up by an average of £2,700, “affecting demand, profitability and jobs”.Earlier this month, Honda said a no-deal scenario would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while BMW said it would move a planned shutdown of its Mini plant in Oxford forward to coincide with the beginning of Brexit in order to minimise the risk of disruption.Meanwhile, Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”. The company’s chief executive, Ralf Speth, has warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Cloudier and breezier in the north, with some rain and feeling cooler.The Met Office warns the public and emergency responders of severe or hazardous weather which has the potential to cause danger to le or widespread disruption through the National Severe Weather Warning Service.The Met Office issues warnings for thunderstorms, rain, snow, wind, fog and ice.These warnings are given a colour depending on a combination of the likelihood of the event happening and the impact the conditions may have.There are a number of ways you can find out whether your area is at risk from flooding.The Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Natural Resources Wales update their warnings 24 hours a day via the Floodline number.The highest 24-hours of rainfall in England occurred in Cumbria on December 5, 2015.According to the Met Office 341.4mm of rain fell at Honister Pass, Cumbria, in 24-hours, a new UK rainfall record, while at Thirlmere 405mm also set a new record for two consecutive rain-days.Sloy Main Adit in Scotland experienced 238mm on January 17, 1974.And on November 11, 1929, Lluest Wen Reservoir in Wales was flooded with 211mm of rainfall.The record for Northern Ireland was in 1968 at Tollymore Forest, County Down, which saw 159mm."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000435758175.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"conservative party conference 2018 date venue theresa may speech","story":"Let’s take a closer look at the event.The event runs from Sunday, September 30 until Wednesday, October 3.The conference is taking place in Birmingham at the International Convention Centre .The Prime Minister will give her keynote address on the final day of the event .Philip Hammond, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is scheduled to give his speech on October 1.Tory Brexiteers, including some MPs, have setup a rival two-day event which will take place 10 miles away from the main conference in Birmingham.One official behind the Alternative Party Conference said that the main event is no longer for conservatives, reports Sky News.The maverick event will run from October 1 to 2.Speakers will include former international development secretary Priti Patel, veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash and former UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004363109061.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jezza may snap election brexit","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is so desperate for a fresh election he will swallow his lelong hatred of the EU and support a second referendum.And Tory PM Theresa May would rather call a snap ­election than have another Brexit poll.So, despite Downing Street denials, it looks as  we are lurching towards a showdown which risks 1,000 years of British democracy.For be in no doubt, a Corbyn election victory and a Marxist-led Momentum regime would fundamentally change our way of le, our economy and the social fabric of this nation.Even a coalition with other parties would hand Momentum anarchists control over crucial levers of power.This week’s Labour conference in Liverpool is a Jezza rally, with far-left cheerleaders clamouring to bring down the Tories.Almost 90 per cent want a second referendum. Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

H. St. John de Crèvecoeur.Then a severe frost succeeds which prepares it to receive the voluminous coat of snow which is soon to follow though it is often preceded by a short interval of smoke and mildness, called the Indian Summer, he wrote.The term then often appeared in American literature across the following century and, according to Phrases.org, in the 1830s, Indian Summer was used figuratively to refer to any late flowering following a period of decline. Following Storms Ali and Bronagh, the weather looks set to do a U-turn in the last week of September with temperatures beginning to climb to 23C by Thursday September 27 - making it hotter than Athens.The south, Wales and the Midlands will see the best of the weather with glorious sunshine as Brits enjoy an Indian Summer.But the north will see more wind and outbreaks of rain through the week and cloudier skies - although temperatures will still be warmer than the recent chillier conditions.And sunshine is predicted for most the UK at the weekend.The Met Office said: A north-south split will develop through the middle of the week, becoming cloudier and windy with some rain in the North. but remaining settled, dry and mostly sunny in the South.Through the rest of September the weather should stay largely settled with long spells of sunshine and generally light winds.For October, settled and drier conditions are likely to dominate across many parts of the UK during the beginning of this period."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436797536-e1537902836110.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jane moore katie price rehab romance","story":"The second time was in January 2016, behind the scenes of Loose Women.In the intervening years, I had made several waspish remarks about her on this very page  so fully expected a frosty exchange.But she was disarmingly self-deprecating, funny and, to my utter surprise, very much a woman’s woman.“I know you think I’m a nightmare,” she said matter-of-factly. “And you’re probably right. But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They might be bumping into things. It’s hard to walk in a straight line when you’re that intoxicated.”A change in personality is also a pretty good indicator, Koob said.One marker I use is dramatic and rapid swings in emotionality.“One moment, your friend might be praising you and telling you how much they care. The next, they turn, and it’s the complete opposite emotion, like anger directed at you.”Its an obvious answer but the key is to drink in moderation - both to protect your dignity and your long-term health.According to Alcohol Concern, excessive drinking is the biggest risk factor for death, ill-health and disability among 15-49 year-olds in the UK - and is the fth biggest factor among all ages.To reduce your chances of developing a whole host of potentially fatal diseases, Public Health England is encouraging middle-aged drinkers to have at least two days a week off the booze.A study from the University of Calornia, San Diego, claimed to have found that around 40 per cent of brains are more prone to blackouts from booze and drugs than others.Well, its all to do with ethanol - a compound found in alcohol.Drinking up to four boozy drinks in a short space of time can heighten its effects - particularly  youve not eaten much.When the stomach is empty, ethanol reaches the blood as soon as half an hour after consumption.That means that as you drink, your blood ethanol level inches high and higher for up to 90 minutes - possibly without realising just how drunk you are until youre already pretty far gone.After a couple of hours on the sauce, that ethanol then dfuses from the blood into the brain.The booze then targets receptors in the part of the brain which controls emotions and recollection, including something called the gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA.When GABA receptors are affected by alcohol, the brain stops transmitting signals that would otherwise solidy memories.It also helps the brain to start producing things like dopamine and serotonin, as well as glutamate - the neurotransmitter that results in your feeling calmer.Thats why you often feel amazing when youre drinking...so you drink more - all the while getting increasingly leathered.But that can also lead to you doing things which are out of character. As your inhibitions go down with that fth G\u0026ampT, you start to think that dancing on the tables a good idea, that sexting your boss is totally legit.And the next day, you cant understand why your boss is looking at you oddly from across the office, or why youre covered in bruises from falling off the table.Its not just the damage to your ego thats the problem - blacking out means that youre drinking to excess, and that comes with all the usual health issues associated with drinking, including developing liver problems, heart disease and ious cancers."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437078059.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"639\" width=\"960","title":"jeremy corbyn speech labour party conference 2018","story":"The hard left leader used his conference speech to party faithful to try to persuade Britain that he is now ready to lead the nation.The 69 year-old doubled down on his Socialist agenda by branding a series of new radical policies “the new political mainstream”.And the party boss claimed that next year’s annual party gathering in September 2019 would meet “as a Labour government”.Mr Corbyn, 69, told the audience in Liverpool that his left wing mass movement in now “ready to take charge”.And he instructed them: “We must take our message to every town, city and village. United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997.“Let every constituency, every community know Labour is ready.”But at the same time, he also issued an appeal to his bitterly ided party’s Labour’s squabbling factions to unite.Calling on warring MPs and members to “focus on what unites us”, he pleaded: “We need to foster a much greater culture of tolerance. An end to abuse, online and in person.“We must learn to listen a bit more, and shout a lot less.”Mr Corbyn also admitted the summer had been “tough”, after he was repeatedly rocked by an MPs’ revolt over accusations that he held anti-Semitic views.But while admitting that the row “caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community”, the Labour boss refused to use his major platform to offer Jews another apology.Instead, he only added: “I hope we can work together to draw a line under it”.Mr Corbyn highlighted a series of new policy announcements made through out the four day gathering on Merseyside that have driven Labour even further to the left.They included forcing companies to hand over 10% of their worth to employees, and workers’ takeover of board rooms.He poured fresh scorn on bankers for “piling up profits around the world”.And when the Labour scornfully mentioned Theresa May’s bid to ensire the UK has the lowest corporation tax rates of all the G20 nations, the enterprise-boosting offer was booed by the packed hall.The Labour boss also issued his regular Trump-style rant at the media.JEREMY Corbyn’s speech today drew derision from the Tories - who said his plans would drown Britain in debt and risk betraying Brexit.And Jewish groups criticised the Labour leader for not explaining how he will tackle anti-Semitism. Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis said: Jeremy Corbyn has shown at every turn he is unfit to govern. All he offers are failed ideas that didnt work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste - just like last time.He confirmed Labour are opening the door to re-running the referendum, which would take us all back to square one.And he didnt even apologise to Jewish people for his total failure to tackle the anti-Jewish racism that is re in the Labour Party.Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, added: “Jeremy Corbyn’s words mean nothing until Labour takes the necessary steps to deal with anti-Semitism in its ranks.“Words have long ceased to be enough. Actions are what matter.”Unions cheered his proposals for greater state control of industry - but business groups expressed caution.The director general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, warned that policy built on ideology and diktat would harm those who can least afford it by driving down investment, productivity and pay.Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: While weve heard some welcome commitments from the Labour Party in the past few days, it should more readily acknowledge the social contribution of businesses across the UK.And free-market think-tanks were also critical - Mark Littlewood of the IEA said: “Jeremy Corbyn is right to highlight that parts of the establishment have far too much control over Britain’s economy.“Westminster’s elite should not be picking winners and losers in business, or deciding whose jobs have guaranteed funding from the taxpayer.“Yet his proposals today – including the creation of 400,000 green energy jobs and increased centralisation of the National Health Service - imagine a Britain in which consumer choice is further limited, and more services are controlled by a select few in Whitehall.” John O’Connell of the Taxpayers’ Alliance added: Corbyns angry rant offered nothing to the hard-pressed, silent majority of taxpayers who want to be trusted to spend their own money and care for their children as they see fit - without being clobbered by even more cruel punishment taxes.” While pledging to protect press freedom, the then immediately insisted: “Freedom here too often means the freedom to spread lies and half truths and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful”.And he heaped praise in Spanish on his Mexican-born we Laura Alez, telling her from the podium: “Tu eres mi fuerza y mi apoyo. Gracias Laurita ”.Business leaders reacted with horror, with the BCC saying his leftwing package would inflict “a serious impact on business confidence, investment and growth, which ultimately would hurt the very people and communities that need support the most”.Its Director General Adam Marshall added: “While there were some bright spots, Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business, big and small alike”.But unions firebrands loved Mr Corbyn’s 70 minute-long diarribe. Unite general secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey dubbed it “*inspiring”.PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka added: Today Jeremy has set out a transformative and radical socialist vision for the country”.Veteran leftwing Labour MP Dennis Skinner was left jubilant, telling the hall: “I want to nationalise something every week”.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis said Mr Corbyn had showed that “at every turn he is unfit to govern”.It was his traditional blend of bile, fantasy and lies, falteringly recited in his two stock voices — all hammily-acted phoney compassion one moment, ­sudden exaggerated rage the next.He turned his ire first on Tories, then on a critical Press. This, he insisted, would remain free under Labour — but not just to print what it liked. Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government. Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded. And he is the “next Secretary of State for Justice”, God help us.Corbyn is keen to rebrand his extremism as mainstream in an era when capitalism has “failed”. It is, in reality, a dog-eared hard-left roadmap to ruin on a scale we have never experienced. A Britain which would kill ambition and enterprise and drive out successful firms by stealing their property. Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield. Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable. Socialism is the last thing we need.Next to last are Tory “Corbyn-lite” tax rises. Record job figures, low inflation and interest rates add up to a society and economy far healthier than the dystopia of chippy Corbynite imaginations.But  the Tories don’t fix the problems that DO exist they’re sunk, and Britain too.Mr Lewis added: “All he offers are failed ideas that didn’t work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste – just like last time.“He didn’t even apologise to Jewish people for his total failure to tackle the anti-Jewish racism that is re in the Labour Party.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437083496-e1537975066773.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"traveller 21 sprayed with ammonia and had hand sliced off with machete after he was lured to meet two teen girls in feud over his sister","story":"Ellie Elston, 18, and another girl aged 17 allegedly tricked Francis Doherty, 21, to meet them in West London - where Elstons boyfriend Miles Connors, 23, carried out the violent attack.Connors sprayed his former friend Mr Doherty with the corrosive substance before hacking his hand off and leaving it on the ground, Isleworth Crown Court heard.Police bodycam footage of the aftermath of the attack showed Mr Doherty screaming: “My whole hand’s on the floor. I’m dying, I’m dying”.The jury were told Connors, his brother Daniel, 19, and the two girls kidnapped Mr Dohertys 14-year-old nephew and made him call his uncle as part of the plot.Prosecutor Roger Smart said the boy was stripped naked, wiped down with bleach, dressed in girls’ clothing and told to leave London after the attack.The Evening Standard reported Mr Smart as saying: “[The boy] was told to call Francis Doherty and say that he had met two girls who are interested in meeting him.“Both [the 17-year-old] and Ellie Elston took turns speaking to Francis, enticing him to come and meet them.“They told Francis to attend alone and to look out for a white BMW.Francis agreed to join them and hurriedly made his way to the location.”The court was told Mr Dohertys and Connors families had been at war for some time after Connors made disrespectful remarks about Francis sister, Biddy Doherty.The pair had tried to sort out the problems by fighting in front of a crowd, which Mr Doherty is said to have won.But three days later Connors and his fellow defendants allegedly acted out their bloody revenge plot.With his arm mangled and fearing for his le, Mr Doherty ran behind some parked cars and saw Connors get into a Jeep style vehicle, the prosecution said.In it Mr Doherty saw his nephew, Michael Connors, staring back at him before the vehicle sped off, the jury heard.The kidnap victim was driven around in the boot of a car for four hours before he was released and told not to contact family members or the police, the court heard.Surgeons attempted to reattach Mr Dohertys hand to his arm after the attack in Northolt, West London.Three weeks after the incident Mary Connor, the sister-in-law of Francis Doherty, was allegedly called by members of the Connors family telling them to drop the case for £50,000.If they did not accept, they threatened to kill her and her family, the court was told.Connors, of no fixed address, Daniel Connors, of Northolt, Elston, from North West London, and the 17-year-old girl deny conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to kidnap, conspiracy to falsely imprison, and conspiracy to wound with intent.Connors also denies attempted murder and causing wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.The Connors sister Christina, 18, and her boyfriend Aidan Mason, 20, are accused of offering £50,000 in cash  Mr Doherty refused to co-operate with police.Mason, from Tottenham, and Christina Connors, from north-west London, both deny perverting the course of justice.The trial continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437103227.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"moonpig begs customers to stop uploading pics of their genitals to cards in hilarious tweet","story":"The custom cards company had people creasing up with its saucy announcement through its official UK Twitter account this morning.It said: Please stop uploading pics of your genitals to our cards it is against our ts and cs.Moonpigs online photo editor allows customers to put their own snaps on greeting cards, as well as other gts including phone cases, t-shirts and mugs.But it seems theyve had enough of seeing some peoples private sentiments being pasted on their presents.The companys content rules strictly prohibit any material that is pornographic, obscene, indecent or offensive being printed on their personalised cards and goods.Clearly some people didnt read the small print.A Moonpig spokesperson told The Sun Online: We’ll produce anywhere between 100-200k cards a day and at least two or three of those might infringe our terms.We have one guy who’s particularly good at spotting them although a couple occasionally slip through the cracks.We also see a massive rise around Valentines Day, with as many as 20 a day that we have to deny.And yes, the girls are as bad as the boys.Followers of the online card company came out with some hilarious responses to the rude revelation.Rachel Hawkins said: My Dad is very apologetic but hes going through a bad time.No excuse I know.Moonpig was in a forgiving mood and replied As long as hes aware now.Scott Bond asked the company: Do you do pop-up cards?

These are £200 bags. It takes some force to break the wheels and crush them like that.The contractor for a flight simulator firm claims his iPad screen was cracked so he lodged a Swissports customer service desk.He said: They said it wasnt damaged enough for them to do anything and wed have to contact Etihad.We were trying to explain how dficult the wheels would make our train journey. They just didnt care.Michelle Knight also shared pictures of her broken bag after travelling to Almeria, Spain, from Manchester Airport.And Hannah Henry, 21, from Stockport, flew back from Palma in Spain on June 26 to find her bag was destroyed.She said: I noticed straight away when it came off the conveyor. There was a big crack down one side.Hannah has now had to fight through Tui to get her bag replaced - and she said she had to settle for a lesser version of the original.A Swissport spokesman said: “We take our baggage handling responsibilities very seriously and we handle all complaints on a case by case basis.”It comes after Elizabeth posted the shocking footage online when she noticed her own case slide off the trailer and onto the floor with the force it is thrown.She can be heard saying thats mine yeah, as her pink suitcase topples to the ground - while the workers colleague looks on.The 28-year-old, from Bury, told the Manchester Evening News: Im very angry and shocked. It was a new case. The case is dented and the protective layer has been torn off it.The Swissport worker can be seen chucking bags onto the trailer without looking, and only stops to scoop up the fallen cases after five had hit the ground.A Manchester Airport spokeswoman said: “We are disappointed to see this unacceptable handling of bags by a Swissport employee and have raised this with them directly.”Meanwhile, a £1,000 guitar case made from the same material as a Boeing 787 was destroyed by easyJet baggage handlers.John Challis posted footage of him picking up the indestructible carbon fibre case in Berlin to discover it had gouges and cracks in it.EasyJet have apologised for the incident and say they are looking into the issue."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437030212.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family visit one thousand wetherspoons ten year pub crawl","story":"The Latchfords have spent 10 years touring Britain and Ireland and were first through the door at the chains latest opening in Somerset last week.They ticked off 900 in the first six years but were so prolic they have since had to wait for new ones to open.The only existing bars they havent been to yet are the two beyond security at Heathrows Terminal 5 - which they plan to attend the next time they go on holiday.Their odyssey began with a throwaway promise that mum Sheila, 61, made to son Christy, then 17, which, due to his autism, he took literally and held them to.Sheila, of Kidderminster, said: Our daughter Amy works at the Penny and Black Wetherspoon in Kidderminster and when she started Christy was not yet 18.We wanted to take him in to show her working behind the bar but in those days they had a really strict rule which meant anyone under 18 had to have a meal.We had just eaten so left. I said rather foolishly, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, dont worry, when you are 18 we will go to all of them.When you say something like that to someone with autism it is taken seriously. The minute he turned 18 he was back in the Penny and Black in Kidderminster.We were never intending to do them all, but had promised him and he wouldnt let us forget it.It didnt occur to us it could be doable until I had to go to Scotland to work. They drove me up and we went to ones in Dundee and Edinburgh and it just went from there.The chain currently has around 900 pubs open across the UK but some of the ones the Latchford family have previously visited have since closed.Sheila, husband Keith, 63, and Christy took six years to do the first 900 but in the last four years they have had to wait for new ones to open.The family did all the local area ones first around the Midlands which they could get to in a day and back, before focusing on big cities such as Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol and London whilst also enjoying some sightseeing.They have been to every corner of the UK and to Ireland three times to do all the Wetherspoon pubs in both Northern and Southern Ireland.Sheila, a part-time civil servant, added: It was a lot easier when there were loads to do, we could just fly up to Glasgow and walk around and come straight back.We would often book the night away, next week we are going to the new one in St Pancreas when it opens.We only target openings now and keep a close eye on the website and are part of the Wetherspoon appreciation society group on Facebook.The only ones we have not been to are the ones in Heathrow terminal 5 which are after security. We will have to do that when we plan our next holiday.But as far as we know we have done every other one in the UK and Southern Ireland.The family reached the 1,000 milestone when they were first through the door at the opening of the Palladium Electric in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, last week.The latest one in Midsomer Norton was our 1,000th, Sheila said. They dont serve Champagne anymore but we had a nice bottle of sparkling wine instead.It was a real landmark but unfortunately we were only there for a limited time but had a good look around.Sheila says their orders y from coffees to pints and on around half the 1,000 occasions they have added either a breakfast or evening meal to their visit.She added: We really like them and always make a beeline for them even  they are ones we have been to before.The prices are very reasonable but we also love the surroundings. They refurbish a lot of old buildings and there are lots of converted churches, banks, theatres etc.Probably the old Caley picture house in Edinburgh is our favourite but there are so many really good ones.We also all really like the Cabot Court hotel in Weston-super-Mare which is right on the seafront.Keith, a full time carer for Christy, now 28, said: Everyone tends to say that the historical buildings are the best, and that is true.There are some beautul conversions of old premises and some of the newer pubs in particular are fantastic.It is a great hobby for us together and Christy loves it.Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin congratulated the family on their achievement.He said: “This is a wonderful achievement by Sheila, Keith and Christy.“They must have travelled tens of thousands of miles over the years to visit each Wetherspoon pub.“We thoroughly appreciate their loyalty and commitment and trust they will continue to visit our pubs for many more years to come.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000368968085.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"chancellor announces early budget","story":"The Treasury announced the date yesterday - just days after denying to The Sun that it would be brought forward to avoid a Parliamentary log jam.It means critical decisions over tax and spending will be presented to MPs before any Brexit deal is agreed with Brussels.Ardent Eurosceptics have claimed some in their ranks could vote down parts of the Budget in protest at any further concessions to the EU.

that little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time,

These boys included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh.In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of those gang or train rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present.During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me.Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied all the allegations. This week he said hed never even heard of Swetnick and called her accusations ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.The hearing will be the first time the country sees and hears from the 51-year-old Ford beyond the grainy photo that has been flashed on television in the 10 days since she came forward with her contention.In testimony released in advance of the hearing, she said she was appearing only because she felt it was her duty, was frankly terried and has been the target of vile harassment and even death threats.It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court, she was to tell the senators. My responsibility is to tell the truth.The stakes for both political parties and the country are high. Republicans are pushing to seat Kavanaugh before the November midterms, when Senate control could fall to the Democrats and a replacement Trump nominee could have even greater dficulty.Kavanaughs ascendance to the court could help lock in a conservative majority for a generation, shaping dozens of rulings on abortion, regulation, the environment and more.But Republicans also risk rejection by female voters in November  they are seen as not fully respecting women and their allegations.The Senate Judiciary Committee comprised of 11 Republicans, all men, and 10 Democrats will hear from just the two witnesses.Democrats plan to ask Kavanaugh  hell be willing to undergo FBI questioning about the ious claims and demand Republicans press him about his drinking and behaviour as a teenager.One goal is to emphasise inconsistencies in his statements so far and make him appear nervous, while questions for Ford will be aimed at giving her a chance to explain herself.Ford will testy first at the hearing, which starts at 10am and at her request is being held in a small hearing room that seats only a few dozen spectators.Republicans have hired an outside attorney, Phoenix prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, to handle much of their questioning to avoid having an all-male contingent interrogating her.Ford plans to tell the committee that, one night in the summer of 1982, a drunken Kavanaugh forced her down on a bed, groped me and tried to take off my clothes, then clamped his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream before she was able to escape.I believed he was going to rape me, she will say, according to her prepared testimony.In Kavanaughs prepared testimony, the 53-year-old appellate judge acknowledges drinking in high school with his friends, but says hes never done anything remotely resembling what Ford describes.He said he has never had a sexual or physical encounter of any kind with her.The Senate Judiciary Committee two days ago scheduled its vote for Kavanaughs nomination to the Supreme Court for 9.30am local time tomorrow.This was done in order to comply with rules that requires three days notice is given ahead of any vote.However, committee chairman Chuck Grassley also said that the vote can still be delayed, but notice was given in case a Friday vote was desired.He tweeted: Still taking this 1 step at a time. After hrg Dr Ford \u0026amp Judge Kavanaughs testimony-  were ready to vote, we will vote. If we arent ready, we wont. Cmte rules normally require 3 days notice so were following regular order.However, Democrats have said the move scheduling the vote was outrageous and designed to railroad through Kavanaughs nomination.If his nomination is approved, it would be brought to the Senate where a vote in the full chamber - currently controlled by the Republicans - would secure his position on the Supreme Court."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437140686.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vladimir putin alexander petrov ruslan boshirov civilians","story":"Yesterday, British online sleuths identied Ruslan Boshirov as Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga, a decorated colonel in Moscow’s GRU intelligence agency.Boshirov, one of two thugs believed to have been behind the nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March, was given the Hero of the Russian Federation medal in 2014 - a decoration reportedly handed out by Putin himself, claims the report by Bellingcat.However, Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, dismissed the claims, saying they are part of an information campaign.Brazen Zakharova pointed out that the report had been published while Prime Minister Theresa May appeared at the UN.She wrote on Facebook: There is no evidence, so they continue the information campaign, the main task of which is to ert attention from the main question: What happened in Salisbury?The question is: when will there be any evidence of the involvement of anyone, as London tells us, of poisoning in Salisbury?Previously Putin said the pair were simply civilians and backed laughable claims they were tourists visiting a cathedral insisting there was nothing criminal” in their trip to the UK.But online sleuths at Bellingcat and The Insider said last night there was no doubt the men “were in fact ­Russian officers operating on a clandestine government mission”.And they added: “It is highly likely that Putin would have been familiar with the identity of Colonel Chepiga.”The investigators plan to reveal Petrov’s name within two weeks.They believe he is a captain in military intelligence. Bellingcat said Chepiga, 39, joined a marine commando and special forces military school at 18.He later joined Spetsnaz, Russia’s SAS. He served  in the Chechnya war and was near the Ukraine border as Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.Bellingcat, run by blogger Eliot Higgins, 39, in Leicester, says Chepiga was given the undercover identity of Boshirov at least eight years ago.He identied him by scouring old leaked databases and matching passport photos from the last 15 years with images given by Wilts Police.Speaking on Newsnight last night, an investigator from Bellingcat revealed the investigative website will reveal the real identity of the second Russian suspect, known as Alexander Petrov, within the next fortnight.He said they believe he is of a more junior military rank, possibly a Captain in Russian military intelligence.Russia is investigating how the suspects’ passport details were leaked.Boshirov and Petrov failed to kill ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and daughter Yulia in March’s attack.But Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in July after handling  the Novichok."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436830308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"emmanuel macron reverse brexit second referendum","story":"The French president even suggested a re-run of the referendum might be necessary because voters didnt grasp how complex the issue was when they backed Brexit two years ago.Mr Macron insisted he didnt want to meddle in British politics - despite saying hed love to have the UK back in the EU.Asked  European leaders would welcome Britain back after a second referendum, he told Bloomberg: For sure.He denied that he secretly wants the UK to leave so Paris can grab business from the City, saying: This is about history, not about domestic interests.But Mr Macron added: Im not the one to decide such a move and I do respect the choice of British voters.So I dont want to interfere in this debate about a second referendum and so on.He also took aim at the Leave campaign which won the 2016 referendum - suggesting Brits had been misled by politicians such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.The president said: It costs a lot, it’s much more complicated than they initially thought.Mr Macron has come under fire from Brexit campaigners for his efforts to overturn the referendum.And hes accused of deliberately setting out to punish the UK for quitting the EU in the hope of turning voters against Brexit.The ex-Home Secretary insisted No Deal would be such a disaster that shed rather see a peoples vote instead.She has previously been fiercely loyal to the PM - and is a firm supporter of Mrs Mays Chequers plan for Brexit.Ms Rudd told ITVs Peston last night: I don’t think No Deal will happen.I think that  we cant get a negotiated deal that the Prime Minister brings back through Parliament then I think that we’re in completely uncharted territory constitutionally.But I do think it would be ironic indeed  we got a people’s vote because the more Brexit-y people in my party were unable to support the Prime Minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Asked  a second referendum would be better than No Deal, the senior MP replied: Absolutely."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437087878-e1537965768267.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"benny the thames beluga whale heading for london after being spotted upriver three days since first sighting","story":"Experts last night expressed relief as the whale appeared to be swimming east down the Thames, back out to sea, but it has now taken an about-turn and is heading for the capital.Onlookers remain on the shore of the river to catch a glimpse of the elusive creature.Birding expert Dave Andrews first saw the white whale, which an expert has confirmed to be a Beluga, at 11am on Tuesday near Gravesend, Kent.After it disappeared for around 15 hours overnight, Benny was spotted again yesterday morning in the same area, a relief to conservationists.Yesterday RSPCA spokeswoman Clare Dew said: “We don’t have any concerns about the whale itself at the moment, and it is certainly still behaving normally.“It is not attempting to come anywhere near the banks and is staying in the deep channel in the middle of the river.”Sightings were confirmed again this morning, but further up the Thames towards London than yesterday.It has been popping to the surface, visible due to its ghostly white colour, every couple of minutes.A patrol boat is monitoring its movements.Conservationists are now concerned that the Beluga whale could be very lost  it doesnt  to the sea.There are also concerns the Beluga might eat a plastic bag, due to the large numbers of them in the Thames, according to Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority.THIS Beluga whale has got lost and its sat-nav is broken.They rely on using a natural “sonar” to get around — sending a series of clicks through the water which bounce back to them.This system can be damaged. It may have been too close to sonar used in submarines, acoustic deterrents used to keep seals away from salmon farms or sonar used in the fishing industry.Damage could also occur naturally, in the same way humans can suffer a stroke. The other thing which could cause the whale to get lost is becoming separated from other Belugas.The Thames is not the place for a Beluga whale.It will not be able to find all the food it needs.They are very blubbery and can store lots of energy, but it will still be hungry.RSPCA’s Acting Chief Inspector Clair Dew said they would be keeping a close watch on the whale’s progress, but there were no plans to mount a rescue mission or encourage it out to sea.After first seeing the whale on Tuesday morning, Andrews tweeted: Cant believe Im writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort.He claimed the whale remained in the same spot for hours feeding around the barges in the river.Marine experts told the BBC it is almost certainly a Beluga whale and urged the public to watch it from the shore.Lucy Babey from ORCA said: This is the most southerly sighting of a beluga we have ever seen around these shores.Belugas can weigh up to 1,400kg and measure more than four metres long.Sightings of Beluga whales are extremely rare on the coasts of the UK and normally only occur off the coast of Scotland, as this is closest to their native waters.Beluga whales usually travel in groups or pods and a sighting of a solo whale could indicate it has got lost, or is disorientated.After Andrews tweeted the exact location, there was an influx of people arriving at the scene to view the whale for themselves.The whale is used to much colder seas north of the UKLucy from ORCA told The Sun: We want to urge people not to disturb the animal. Its out of range and probably distressed.People rushing to the site in boats or with drones will only disturb the whale and cause it more distress.If you wish to see the whale for yourself, stay on the shore and do not get in the water.The last time a whale was spotted in the River Thames was a bottlenose whale, now known as the River Thames Whale.In January 2006 a female northern bottlenose whale swam up the Thames and caused hysteria in London.She sadly died during a rescue mission near Battersea.A spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: Belugas are High Arctic species and this one is thousands of miles from where it should be! Belugas are usually associated close to the ice in places like Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea.A crowd gathered on Tuesday afternoon to catch a sighting of the Beluga whaleHe or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble. There are a few reports of belugas in the UK in recent years.In the summer of 2015 two were spotted off the Northumberland coast and one in Northern Ireland. We would urge that the whale is given space and disturbance is kept to a minimum."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431336217-e1536264401854.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mum baby decapitated botched birth doctor said ive fixed him","story":"Laura Gallazzi was 25 weeks pregnant when she went into labour, with a top NHS doctor pulling the babys legs during the birth.But the babys head was detached from his body during the horric delivery, with his head still left in his mothers womb.The first-time mum was then forced to undergo a C-section to remove the head - which was sewn back on to the tragic tots body so she could hold him and say goodbye.Cradling the plush bear that holds her sons ashes, the mum revealed to BBC Radio Scotland her terror at seeing her sons body, unsure what she would be confronted with.She said: I thought I dont want to see him, dont bring him in here, because I didnt know what I was going to be looking at.The doctor said its alright. Her words were Ive fixed him.Since a tribunal into the 2014 delivery at Dundees Ninewells hospital in Dundee, Scotland, Laura has spoken out of how she could not forgive the consultant gynaecologist, Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, for Stevens death.The investigation found that while Dr Laxmans decision to proceed with a vaginal delivery instead of a C-section was a mistake, the medic was cleared to  to work.Traumatised Laura, 34, earlier told The Sun: She butchered my son. How could this happen in this day and age?”Only three babies in the world are known to have succumbed to such a sickening fate and Laura said: It’s like something from medieval times. I never imagined this would be my experience of birth.”Dr Laxman admitted she had tried “too hard” to deliver the tot and the tribunal said she had been wrong not to carry out the initial C-section. But it ruled the senior gynaecologist had been working in the “best interests” of the mum, and that she posed “no risk to patient safety”.The ordeal has taken a huge toll on haunted Laura who now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder.The mum now keeps Stevens ashes in a teddy so she can have him with her — and on her forearm has tattoo prints of his hands and feet as well as the roman numerals of the year he was born.She says: “Even though I wasn’t ever able to hold him, I can carry him with me wherever I go now.

Rex - no jokes about the Labour leader being an old dinosaur, please! - is an apt description of many of the delegates attending this conference: young, left-wing and clamouring for a socialist revolution under Mr Corbyn.And to listen to Mr Corbyn - and his closest ally John McDonnell earlier this week - you\u0027d think Labour\u0027s red revolution was just round the corner and a general election was imminent.Their speeches sounded like those of an opposition leader and shadow chancellor when it\u0027s known that an election is only months away. Mr Corbyn received no fewer than 10 standing ovations during and at the end of his speech.But the biggest was when he said Labour would press for a general election and called on Theresa May and the Tories to make way for Labour.Yet in fringe meetings during the week, most Labour backbenchers who spoke injected a dose of realism and were highly sceptical about the likelihood of an early election, predicting - rightly, surely - that the Tories are not going to risk giving up power by going to the polls.The other really big standing ovation Mr Corbyn won was when he said Labour would \"recognise a Palestinian state as soon as we take office\".Again, as there was during the foreign affairs debate 24 hours earlier, there was waving of Palestinian flags by delegates in the hall. Mr Corbyn had a good passage in his speech on antisemitism, admitting this summer\u0027s row had \"caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour Party\".But critics will say his reassuring words to the Jewish community - \"We are your ally\" - should have been said months ago.Having said that, this was probably Mr Corbyn\u0027s best speech as Labour leader - less rambling than some and delivered in a conversational tone with contrasts in pitch and delivery that suggested he\u0027d had some coaching.His Brexit passage was deftly executed too, especially his offer to \"reach out to the prime minister\" and back the Tories  they get a good deal but to vote against an agreement with the EU  they don\u0027t.And one of the smartest lines in Mr Corbyn\u0027s hour-long speech was when he attacked Tory eurosceptics like Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was loudly booed by Labour delegates in true pantomime villain style.\"The Tory Brexiteers unite the politics of the 1950s with the economics of the 19th century, daydreaming about a Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules,\" he said. Nice line.Brexit has been a muddle and a struggle for Mr Corbyn and the Labour leadership this week. First a group of party fixers spent six hours, meeting long into the night to agree on the wording of the motion to be debated and voted on by the conference.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjA4MTsiGN_4370191.jpg?20180724132652 ","title":"royal wedding gospel singers the kingdom choir are set to tour the uk","story":"Following the Windsor Castle gig - watched by about two billion people - they announced a record deal with Sony in July and are now hitting the road.Starting in Sheffield on 30 April, they will also perform in cities including Manchester, York, Birmingham and Edinburgh before ending in Cardf on 30 May.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\""},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about - sign up for newsletters from the MirrorGet updates straight to your inbox - whether you like Politics, football, showbiz gossip, travel or want to know the latest breaking newsShare\u0026nbspByNicola OakleyHead of Audience16:17, 22 AUG 2018Updated14:44, 7 SEP 2018NewsOn the go?

He used his annual address to his admirers in Liverpool to outline his pitch for a Labour government, telling thousands of party faithful: “Labour is ready.” In an hour-long speech that paused for applause 104 times, he promised a ‘green jobs revolution’, a tax on second homes, and free childcare for all. In a touching tribute in Spanish to his publicity-shy we Laura Alez, he said: You are my force and my support. Thank you Laurita. He addressed the anti-Semitism row which has dogged the party for what he admitted was a “tough” summer.  Boris Johnson, Theresa May - and of course the media - felt the sharp end of Corbyn’s tongue There were even a few pretty good jokes. And, of course, Brexit came up - with the leader vowing as it stands to kill off Theresa May\u0027s plan for leaving the EU. Here’s the most explosive moments of Jeremy Corbyn’s keynote speech to Labour Party Conference.  Corbyn was given a y standing ovation as he addressed the party’s anti-Semitism row - telling the Jewish community, “We are your ally”. The Labour leader admitted this Summer had been “tough” but he pleaded with people to “draw a line” under the saga. His carefully-worded statement said it was “the row over antisemitism” that “caused immense hurt and anxiety in the Jewish community and great dismay in the Labour Party”, rather than anti-Semitism itself. And he accused political opponents who attacked Labour over the row of hypocrisy. He said: “We won’t accept it when we’re attacked by Tory hypocrites who accuse us of antisemitism one day, then endorse Viktor Orban’s hard right government the next. But he also promised to fight anti-Semitism “with every breath I possess.” He added: “I say this to all in the Jewish community: This party, this movement, will always be implacable campaigners against antisemitism and racism in all its forms. We are your ally.” 2. He declared he\u0027d kill off May\u0027s Brexit plan - but gave her a big olive branch  Mr Corbyn made it clear that as it stands, Labour will vote against Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan - which would spell a disastrous defeat for the PM in Parliament. The way ahead is clear,” he declared, despite days of confusion and argument about whether Labour could back a second vote - with the option of Remain. “As it stands, Labour will vote against the Chequers plan or whatever is left of it and oppose leaving the EU with no deal. But he also offered an olive branch to the PM. He said: Deliver a deal that includes acustoms union, no hard border in Ireland, protect jobs, rights at work, environmental and consumer standards, we’ll support that sensible deal.” Delegates applauded as he added: “If you can’t negotiate that, make way for a party that can.” This is an interesting offer. Mr Corbyn did not mention Labour\u0027s \u0027six tests\u0027 for the deal to pass - suggesting, perhaps, he could be rolling the pitch for watering them down. This is confirmed, though. And there\u0027s something pretty important to note - Theresa May has repeatedly refused to enter a customs union.  Delegates whooped and applauded as Corbyn attacked capitalism - after confirming Labour would institute a mass sacking of water firm bosses and force companies to fill a third of their boards with workers. He said: Ten years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth with devastating consequences. But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. The price of that has not just been stagnation, wages falling for the longest period in recorded history, and almost a decade of deeply damaging cuts to public services.  The conference hall gave its biggest standing ovation of the day after Corbyn promised to recognise the Palestinian state as soon as we take office. Palestinian flags were waved in the hall as delegates cheered. All week, hundreds of delegates have been wearing Palestine lanyards to carry their conference passes. Slamming the “ongoing denial of justice and rights”, Mr Corbyn declared: “Our Party is united in condemning the shooting of hundreds of unarmed demonstrators in Gaza by Israeli forces and the passing of Israel’s discriminatory Nation-State Law. “The continuing occupation, the expansion of illegal settlements and the imprisonment of Palestinian children are an outrage. We support a two-state solution to the conflict with a secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state.” Repeating Labour’s existing policy, Corbyn says: “We will recognise a Palestinian state as soon as we take office.” 5. He acknowledged evidence “clearly” points to Russia being behind the Salisbury attack  Corbyn said the evidence around the Salisbury Novichok poisoning “now points clearly to the Russian state”. It was the Labour leader\u0027s strongest statement yet on the attack, and a big step after he faced months of criticism for questioning the evidence he was provided by the government. He said: “We are entering a new fast-changing and more dangerous world including the reckless attacks in Salisbury - which the evidence painstakingly assembled by the police now points clearly to the Russian state.”  Mr Corbyn blasted the Tories for receiving a hand-signed letter of thanks from Hungarian far-right leader Viktor Orban for their “solidarity”, voting not to sanction him in the European Parliament. Then Mr Corbyn turned his fire on Boris Johnson, who said burqa-wearing women look like letterboxes. He said: “Our Party will never stay silent in the face of growing Islamophobia, whether from the far right on the streets, or the former Foreign Secretary’s disgraceful dog-whistle jibes at Muslim women. Labour will work to bring communities together. It is only through the unity of all our people that we can deliver social justice for anyone.” 7. He told an EXCELLENT joke at Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s expense - complete with pantomime booing  Mr Corbyn said the Tory government are bringing in the lowest corporation tax of any comparable country. Conference booed. “And then there’s Jacob Rees-Mogg!” He said. This time conference REALLY booed. And then he told the best joke of conference season so far, saying Tory Brexiteers are daydreaming about a Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules.” He also took aim at Liam Fox, who he said was, “itching to scrap workers’ rights and privatise the NHS ... with a side order of chlorinated chicken.” 8. He announced Labour would dramatically increase the amount of free childcare  Unlimited free childcare will be available for the poorest families under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn confirmed. The leader promised a major expansion of the policy to help parents of children aged two to four. Labour already promised last year to offer 30 hours per week of free childcare for all children aged two to four - not just those who work. Despite this being an old policy, Corbyn said “today I can announce” it. The new bit is that Labour will “phase in” a new, additional system that will allow parents to claim extra subsidised hours on top of 30 per week. Labour sources said the extra hours would be available to all parents of kids aged two to four. They would be free for households earning less than \u0026pound16,000, and \u0026pound4 an hour for those earning over \u0026pound66,000, with a sliding scale of fees in between.  Sources said there would be no limit to the number of extra hours a family could claim - effectively making the free hours offer limitless for the poorest households. Labour said Mr Corbyn will also increase funding for nurseries that say they have struggled to afford the Tories\u0027 free childcare scheme. Parents would get a new online portal to manage their account after complaints about the existing system. Over two terms - which could be as late as 2032 - childcare workers would be required to have a \u0027level 3\u0027 qualication  or be working towards one. And pay for all childcare workers would be hiked from a current minimum of \u0026pound7.20 an hour to at least \u0026pound10.Decent early years education is now at risk of becoming a privilege, Jeremy Corbyn said.  Mr Corbyn used his speech to highlight Shadow Housing Minister John Healey\u0027s plan to tax holiday homes. The party estimates up to 174,000 homes would be slapped with the new levy, which is equivalent to double the current rate of council tax on each home - around \u0026pound3,000 a year. It could raise more than \u0026pound500million a year, Labour claimed, and would not apply to rental properties or static caravans. Mr Corbyn said: Think of it as a solidarity fund for those with two homes to help those without any home at all. He went on: Labour will embark on the biggest home building programme in half a century. 10. He invited a Tory peer to cross the floor and join “the new political mainstream  Mr Corbyn said: “Labour speaks for the new majority, why last year we won the biggest increase in the Labour vote since 1945, and why Labour’s ideas have caught “the mood of our time”. “And conference, it isn’t me saying that – it’s a former Conservative Treasury minister, Lord O’Neill. Former Goldman Sachs chief economist Lord O\u0027Neill quit the Northern Powerhouse and Tory whip in 2016, later slamming Conservative splits. “I’ve never sought to capture the mood of a Tory minister before, but let me say to his Lordship: you’re welcome, come and join us in the new political mainstream.” 11. He ranted at the media for \u0027spreading lies\u0027 and \u0027smearing the powerless\u0027  In what has become an annual staple of Corbyn\u0027s conference speech, he had a vicious pop at the mainstream media, accusing them of a “propaganda of privilege”. “It turns out that the billionaires who own the bulk of the British press don’t like us one little bit,” he said. “Now it could be because we’re going to clamp down on tax dodging. Or it may be because we don’t fawn over them at white tie dinners and cocktail parties. “Or it could even be because Tom Watson has been campaigning for the second part of the Leveson media inquiry to be set up.” He said freedom of the press must be protected, but adds: “A free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.” And in a Trump-esque twist, he encouraged supporters to use social media to challenge the media. He said: You challenge their propaganda of privilege by using the mass media of the 21st century: social media. But he urged followers to be nice. He added: We need to foster a much greater culture of tolerance. An end to abuse, online and in person. We must learn to listen a bit more, and shout a lot less. To focus on what unites us. 12. He unveiled his \u0027green jobs revolution\u0027  Mr Corbyn revealed details of his \u0027green jobs revolution\u0027. The party has committed to reducing Britain\u0027s emissions by 60% by 2030, and eliminating them altogether by 2050. In the process, the party leader claimed Labour would create 400,000 jobs - doubling the number of onshore wind turbines, septupling the number onshore and reversing Tory solar subsidy cuts. He said: I know that sounds ambitious. It is ambitious and will be delivered with the most far-reaching programme of investment and transformation in decades.  In the text of the speech, he was supposed to say at the very end: Our task is to build that Britain and together we can. But he got carried away and said the eminently less quotable: “Our task is to build to Britain, build a Britain together, build a Britain for that security together, and we can!” BONUS: Here is Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner whistling the Red Flag.

Heading to Brussels along with Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader is expected to warn Barnier to avoid a no-deal Brexit at all costs. Corbyn said yesterday Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on Theresa May\u0027s proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the European Union is hanging by a thread. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Corbyn said: ”With just weeks of negotiating time left, it’s clear that UK-EU Brexit talks are in a perilous state. Time is running out and companies are losing patience with the absence of any clarity from the government.  “Crashing out of Europe with no deal risks being a national disaster. That is why I’m meeting EU officials today, and I will be urging them to do all they can to avoid a ‘no-deal’ outcome, which would be so damaging to jobs and living standards in both the UK and EU countries.” Shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner, appearing on ITV\u0027s Peston show, said the party would be willing to make compromises with the Tories to avoid a no-deal. He said: If it means compromising,  it means you bending your red line to give us a customs union, we\u0027re prepared to bend our red lines to give, to give this a deal.

This was an address to a country which is still suffering ten years after the financial crash. His plans are bold but his pitch was simple: only Labour has the policies which will mend the damage caused by the banking crisis and the subsequent Tory austerity. Labour, he declared, is now the new majority whose ideas have caught the mood of the time. Much of the speech was directed to those areas which voted Leave in the Brexit referendum.  Corbyn made clear he understood their motives and stood ready to help them rebuild their communities. “There will be no more left behind areas,” he said. Yet this speech was an acknowledgement that his party must do more to persuade voters it was fit to govern. First, there was an appeal to the Labour rank and file to show more unity. Divided and hate-filled parties will not win elections. Secondly, he looked to reassure people that while his agenda was radical it was also common sense.

Rushmoor in Hampshire is the place where people gave the highest score to the question, how happy were you yesterday, according to an official Government survey. Respondents rated their average happiness as 8.4 out of 10 in 2017/18, up from 7.8 in 2016/17, meaning the area overtakes Craven in North Yorkshire, which was the happiest place in 2016/17, as the happiest place in the UK. Across the UK, average ratings across the four measures of personal well-being were: 7.7 out of 10 for le satisfaction, 7.9 out of 10 for feeling that what you do in le is worthwhile, 7.5 out of 10 for happiness yesterday and 2.9 out of 10 for anxiety yesterday. The Office for National Statistics survey data, compiled between April 2017 and March 2018 and broken down by local authority, shows average ratings for wellbeing across the UK have not changed overall. So how does your area compare?   The local authority area with the lowest ratings for happiness was Fenland in Cambridgeshire, with 6.7 out of 10. People in Rushmoor also have the highest le satisfaction, rating it as 8.6 out of 10, while people in Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire have the lowest, 7.1 out of 10. For feeling le is worthwhile, again people in Rushmoor gave the highest rating at 8.7 out of 10, while the lowest was in Bromley at 7.4. People in Broxbourne in Hertfordshire felt the most anxious, scoring levels the previous day at 3.9 out of 10, while those in Lisburn and Castlereagh in Northern Ireland were the least anxious, just 1.9 out of 10. Average ratings of feeling the things done in le are worthwhile increased in Scotland this was driven by a higher percentage of people reporting very high levels for this measure. Compared with the UK, a larger percentage of people in Wales reported low levels of worthwhile and happiness. Interestingly, a larger proportion of people in Wales reported both low levels of le satisfaction but also very high levels of le satisfaction, suggesting greater disparity in le satisfaction in Wales compared with the UK overall.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made their secret escape from London on Friday for the launch of Soho House\u0027s new luxury private members\u0027 club in the Netherlands. Organised by Soho House founder and chief executive, Nick Jones, there was no expense spared at the lavish affair. And Jones saved two seats on the top table especially for his royal guests. The club operates a strict no-picture and mobile phone policy, but now new details have emerged of what went on behind closed doors at the fancy three-day soiree.  On the Friday night the royal couple were seen working the room as they spoke to the likes of Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne, as well as Kate Moss\u0027 close friend - renowned party planner Fran Cutler. Cutler, who was once dubbed the party rottweiler, is used to rubbing shoulders with the likes of Rita Ora - and now Meghan and Harry. The final guests left the Friday night party at around 5am, although Meghan, 37, and Harry, 34, are thought to have gone to bed \u0027long before\u0027 then. Party-loving Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw was also among the guests. He declared the highlight of his evening was seeing fashion designer Henry Holland attempt to drink his cocktail using the stalk of a pepper as a straw.  While TV presenter Richard Bacon, who cheated death earlier this year after spending 11 nights in a coma due to contracting a killer lung infection, was also in attendance. Meghan and Harry were invited to a walking tour of the red-light district, but decided to give it a miss. They also apparently skipped a lunchtime canal tour on Saturday, in which actor Douglas Booth posted a picture of himself enjoying beef wellington and wine. It\u0027s thought Meghan and Harry chose to decline the invitation for security reasons as they did not want to be photographed and over the course of the weekend tried to keep a low-profile. Meanwhile in the evening, Meghan and Harry were seen giggling as the former Suits actress sipped red wine - Meghan\u0027s favourite is Tignanello, costing \u0026pound115 a bottle - while Harry was seen enjoying vodka cocktails.  They also reportedly tucked into lobster spaghetti, followed by tiramisu. One waitress who served the pair dinner told the Daily Mail : I was so shocked to see them there. They were like any other couple. They ordered food from the normal menu guests order from. During the rest of the evening, Meghan and Harry hung out with Fty Shades actor Jamie Dornan, 36, and his we Amelia Warner, also 36. But the person the newlyweds spent the most time talking to was Markus Anderson, who has been in Meghan\u0027s inner circle for years and is reportedly her \u0027closest friend in the world.\u0027 Anderson and the former Suits star both lived in Toronto. He is a director of Soho House and it is speculated that Anderson is the person who played cupid and set Harry and Meghan up.

But when the guest list is full of celebrities and members of the royal family, it can be easy for a famous face to steal the spotlight.   Princess Eugenie of York is set to wed her fianc\u0026eacute Jack Brooksbank on October 12 and while people are eagerly awaiting the first look at the bride in her dress, they will also be keeping an eye out for a glimpse of her family.   The likes of Prince William , Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will all be in attendance, as well as big names such as George and Amal Clooney and Victoria and David Beckham.   So how do you stop the celebs from hogging the limelight?  The Duchess of Cambridge appears to have come up with her own way of doing just that as people noticed when she attended the wedding of close pals Sophie Carter and Robert Snuggs.  So, how did she do it?  Simple. Instead of splashing out on a glamorous dress for the occasion, she recycled an outfit she\u0027d previously worn for a royal engagement.   She wore a striking blue Catherine Walker dress and matching coat, which she first donned during a tour of Germany back in 2017. The only change to the ensemble was a blue floral headband she added for the ceremony.  People are speculating that she may do the same thing on Eugenie and Jack\u0027s big day so as not to take away any attention from the happy couple, reports news.au.   The 36-year-old mother-of-three also did something similar at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s wedding back in May, choosing to wear a cream dress that was almost identical to the one she wore to Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening in 2015.    If this weren\u0027t enough, Kate was seen to wear recycled outfits to the weddings of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall, Emily McCorquodale and James Hutt, as well as William van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene.  The Duchess of Cambridge also went to special s to ensure she didn\u0027t upstage her little sister Pippa during her nuptials in 2017. Instead of taking on a Maid of Honour role, she spent her time looking after the little bridesmaids and page boys.

But some Mediterranean holiday hotspots could be hit by a deadly - and very rare - weather phenomenon this week that is comparable to a hurricane. Holidaymakers in Greece and Turkey are under threat from torrential rain and winds of up to 100mph as the storm system forms, forecasters say. There is the potential for severe flooding, as well as damaging gusts. The phenomenon is dubbed a \u0027Medicane\u0027 - a tropical-like storm that forecasters say can reach a similar strength to a Category 1 hurricane.  BBC weather presenter Ben Rich said last night that clouds and vicious thunderstorms have already developed across the central Mediterranean. He said these are driven in part by the very warm waters of the Mediterranean sea but also a blob of cold air high up in the atmosphere. These ingredients can give rise to a Medicane, he explained. But what does this mean for holidaymakers? Over the next few days, there is set to be heavy rain and winds potentially gusting up to 100mph, most likely affecting parts of Greece, Mr Rich added.    Tourists in other hotspots could also be affected, according to Weather , which says the weather system\u0027s main threat is heavy rainfall. The website reports: The system is expected to organize and potentially intensy between southern Italy and Libya through the end of the week. This system will meander and perhaps loop over the Ionian Sea through the end of the week. By this weekend, this low-pressure system will be picked up and accelerated toward the northeast and toward Greece and western Turkey. It adds that some spots on the island of Sicily and in Greece could see more than three inches of rain, but many will experience one or two inches. Medicanes - which rely on colder air high up - are typically not of hurricane strength, although some can reach that of a Category 1 hurricane.  They usually form just once or twice each year. Unlike hurricanes, they tend to develop during the autumn to winter season . According to a Columbia University blog by Sarah Fecht, Medicanes have a lot in common with tropical storms, with strong winds spinning around a core and torrential rainfall. The blog continues: In 2014, Medicane Oendresa hit Malta with sustained winds of up to 70 miles per hour and gusts of up to 95mph. Nevertheless, the waters of the Mediterranean aren’t extensive or warm enough to sustain the strength needed to call these storms legitimate hurricanes. Previous Medicanes - a combination of the words \u0027Mediterranean\u0027 and \u0027hurricane\u0027 - have been blamed for devastating floods that have killed hundreds and left others injured or homeless.

Laura Gallazzi was just over 25 weeks pregnant when her waters broke in March 2014. She went into Dundee\u0027s Ninewells hospital to prepare for the premature birth of her son Steven. But a bungled delivery resulted in the infant\u0027s head becoming detached and remaining in her womb. Yet further trauma was to come and Laura was forced to undergo a C-section to retrieve the head. Doctors later reattached the head so Laura could say goodbye.   Opening up about the moment she got to see little Steven for the first time Laura told BBC Radio Scotland: I thought \u0027I don\u0027t want to see him, don\u0027t bring him in here\u0027, because I didn\u0027t know what I was going to be looking at.  The doctor said \u0027it\u0027s alright\u0027. Her words were \u0027I\u0027ve fixed him\u0027. When Laura first went into hospital there was no indication of the horror that was to come. The plan was to keep little Steven in the womb as long as possible but two days later Laura went to the bathroom and found the umbilical cord had slipped out of her womb. Recognising the severity of the situation, Laura was taken to the delivery room. She said she had already been told she would likely need a c-section as Steven was in a breech position. The doctor said \u0027push\u0027 - and I\u0027m thinking to myself no, I\u0027m not in labour, Laura said.  A tribunal later heard that Laura was only 2-3 cm dilated at the time. The optimum for birth is 10cm. Laura said she crawled up the bed to get away from medical staff and her doctor who was trying to pull the baby out in a painful procedure. After 20 minutes Laura says she heard a pop and felt nothing between her legs so assumed she had given birth but she was told to push again. After this, she was put under anaesthetic and woke to be told Steven had died. The consultant gynaecologist who led the delivery, Dr Vishnavy Laxman, visited Laura when she came round.

He continued: There\u0027s a bit more fog around so bear that in mind for the morning commute. Across parts of Southern England, Wales and the Midlands temperatures will go down into single figures and it won\u0027t be far off freezing in some rural spots. Mr Deakin adds there will be more cloud over North-West England and North-West Scotland.  We are starting the day a lot of rain across the far North-West and that rain will push southwards, but as it does so the rain will tend to fizzle out. He says: Further South we start cold, but then the mist and fog should clear through the morning and then we\u0027ve got a lot of warm sunshine.

Brutal ice storms could blast the UK from December as extreme weather rolls in from the Pacic Ocean, Exacta Weather claimed this week. They said the intense cold snap could last all the way to February next year, making it similar to the big freeze of 2010, which saw the coldest December since records began in 1910. Forecaster James Madden said: “Long-range predictions have shown for a time that this winter could deliver some particularly cold and snowy conditions.  “We are expecting a number of widespread snow events to occur during early December and then again around mid-month. This could bring some potentially crippling snowfall as these fronts will clash with cold air pooled over the UK. While another long-range weather forecast showed that the chilly assault could start as early as the beginning of November. It\u0027s thought rising temperatures in the Eastern Pacic could soon reach threshold values for an El Ni\u0026ntildeo Southern Oscillation  to become established, which would trigger extreme weather patterns across the world.

Christine Blasey Ford claims Kavanaugh - Donald Trump\u0027s nominee to fill a vacant seat on the US Supreme Court - pinned her down, groped her and tried to pull off her clothes at a party in 1982.  But now, according to a new bombshell statement, two other men have come forward to claim they actually had the \u0027encounter\u0027 with Ford, not Kavanaugh. It is the latest twist in an explosive political row over Kavanaugh\u0027s suitability to serve in the USA\u0027s most powerful court. He has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct at parties in Washington in the 1980s, which he denies.  Julie Swetnick, the latest accuser, came forward yesterday to claim she attended more than 10 house parties in the Washington area from 1981 to 1983 where Kavanaugh, then in his late teens, was present. She described gang rapes that she said occurred in which boys would line up to rape incapacitated girls. In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these \u0027gang\u0027 or \u0027train\u0027 rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present, she said, mentioning the name of a close friend of Kavanaugh. She did not identy her attackers.  During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes  or something similar placed in what I was drinking, she said.  Swetnick, who is represented by porn star Stormy Daniels \u0027 lawyer, said Kavanaugh was present but did not accuse him of taking part.  She also said she witnessed efforts by Kavanaugh and others to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be \u0027gang raped\u0027 in a side room or a bedroom by a \u0027train\u0027 of numerous boys, adding that she remembers boys including Kavanaugh getting in lines to take part in these rapes.

The baby\u0027s parents had both gone for a swim so, seeing their opportunity to become dads and wanting to look after it, the penguins turned to \u0027kidnap\u0027.  Sandie Hedeg\u0026aringrd Munck, an animal keeper at Odense Zoo in Denmark, told a local broadcaster: I could see that something was completely wrong.  The parents disappeared and the kid was simply kidnapped. It was a pair of gay males who had snatched it and was stood with it.  Sandie explained she believes the mother penguin had gone for her daily bath and didn\u0027t come back in time for the dad\u0027s swim. He, too, went off for a paddle, forgetting all about the baby being on its own. Sandie said: When they saw him alone they probably thought \u0027that’s too bad, we’ll snatch it. Oddly, the parents at first didn\u0027t seem too bothered about their little baby penguin being kidnapped.  I expected the parents would  and demand the child back, but the male was strutting around like he’d never had a kid, she said. The female penguin was apparently much more protective over her young than the father - and could even become aggressive  zookeepers got too close. The penguin parents had a whole day off from taking care of their newborn - leaving it with the kidnappers - before eventually confronting them.

Antonela Milena Padilla, claimed a gang had bundled her into a van, drugged her and cut the baby from her womb. But this week her story was dismissed as lies. The 37-year-old, reportedly used a cushion to fool her husband into believing she was expecting in a bid to convince him not to leave her. As the months went by she increased the size of her belly by filling the cushion with rags, and printed off an ultrasound scan from the internet to show to family and friends, according to reports. Incredibly her husband never suspected anything was wrong and as the day of the birth neared reportedly became increasingly excited at being a father for the first time.  But the elaborate scam spectacularly unravelled on the day she was due to be delivered by C-section at a local hospital. Ms Padilla, from Barranquilla, northern Colombia, reportedly left home at 10am and headed to the clinic, but later said she had been kidnapped by a gang in a red van who bundled her inside and later drugged her. She claimed she woke up at 7pm that evening outside a supermarket in another part of town, and realised the baby was no longer in her womb. Ms Padilla reportedly called home and told her husband and other family members that an organ trafficking gang had cut the baby from her belly in order to sell the baby’s body parts. Worried about her health, her family took her against her will to the local Nino Jesus de Soledad hospital, where shocked medics called police, who launched a massive operation to track down the alleged kidnappers. But officers quickly began to doubt the woman’s story, especially after a hospital evaluation found she had suffered no kne injuries consistent with a ‘back street caesarean’. A further blood test found she had never been pregnant, and found no traces of any sedatives in her body. Ms Padilla’s mother-in-law, who wasn’t named, told Colombia’s Al Dia newspaper that the woman continued to insist she had been pregnant. She said: “They did the tests, and she still tried to convince them she had been expecting. But the gynaecologist confirmed she had never been pregnant.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cammy kerr calls on dundee to show dee fiant spirit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCammy Kerr has called on everyone at Dundee to revive the Dee-fiant spirit to get out of the trouble they find themselves in at the bottom of the Premiership table.The 3-0 home defeat to Hibs last weekend leaves the Dark Blues still stuck on zero points after six league fixtures.A lelong fan of the club, Kerr, however, knows Dundee have got through tougher situations than this in their history.Though he admits they’ll need exactly the same “character” as the club showed to overcome a 25-point deduction in 2010  they are to get off the foot of the ision.He said: “As you see the games going and the points staying the same, it is dficult but that’s why you are a football player and have got to this stage and you need to deal with ups and downs and struggles along the way.“This club has had plenty of struggles in its time, it’s had points deductions and all sorts of things – it’s now about showing that character within the club that I believe no other club has.“We just have to find that within ourselves and push it on and make sure nothing stops us in this search for a victory.“We had a poor start a couple of years ago but we turned things around and that’s what I’m trying to get at.“It’s so dficult but being a Dundee fan and seeing things the way I have over the years, I know there is nothing that should allow this club to say no.“Everyone pulling together, the office staff, kitchen staff, the youth boys, everyone, just keep smiling, keep plugging away and it’s going to turn, I’m positive of that.”Honest as ever, Kerr admits this season just plainly hasn’t been good enough from Dundee.“If you let things get out of hand it’s like a disease that spreads,” he added.“It’s all confidence-related and, as the manager spoke about before, we just need a goal to get us in front.“However, at the same time,  we are going behind in games, we can show resilience that we don’t lie down but fight for every ball, every tackle, everything we have in us, we keep fighting to the end. We just seem to be falling short just now and it’s not good enough.“There’s nothing else for it, it’s the same old cliched stuff – you’ve just go to keep fighting away.“You need to be ready to go on the training field, pushing yourself to the max every day.“We have to put in the hard yards and that’s the only way it will turn.“I know the fans and everyone at the club is frustrated, they’re obviously used to seeing better times than this, but there is still time to get our season going.“That’s the only positive – there’s another game in a few days’ time, a massive game against Hamilton and we’ve got to go and make sure we get a victory.“I know, it’s easy saying that and the punters will be sick to the back teeth of people saying ‘next week, next week’ but it’s the only thing for it.”Hamilton against Dundee has been a grudge match over the past few years and last season at New Douglas Park was one of the stand-out moments for the Dark Blues as they came from behind to win the game in the 97th-minute through A-Jay Leitch-Smith.Kerr added: “Last season at Hamilton was amazing, an incredible finish to the game and that again was a resilient performance full of character within the group.“It’s dficult being positive after Saturday’s defeat and having no points from the first six games but we have to go there, knowing how hard it is down there, it’s an absolute dogfight.“They got a great result last week but it’s a game of football, 90 minutes, and  we get ourselves on top we can win the game on Saturday.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Dundee-bottom.jpg ","title":"dundee are currently the worst football team in the world","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are currently the worst football team in the world, according to statistics.The pressure is mounting on manager Neil McCann after Saturday\u0026#8217s 3-0 home defeat by Hibernian left his side with a record of six defeats in six Premiership games so far this season.And the beleaguered boss will be even more dismayed to discover that, according to one calculation, the Dark Blues are bottom of a world league.Football website whoscored, which takes data from 153 countries, ranks Dundee at the bottom of the international form guide.According to the site, only two other clubs in the world \u0026#8211 Scottish Championship side Falkirk and Bulgarian outfit Septemvri Sofia \u0026#8211 have lost six in a row.But Dundee\u0026#8217s goal dference of -12 puts them at rock bottom.The Dark Blues\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216progress\u0026#8217 in the table has been eagerly followed by Dundee United fans on Twitter.According to @callum1247, the clinching result was last night when Guingamp picked up a point away to Nimes in France\u0026#8217s Ligue 1.Dundee fans have hit back at the inevitable jibes.

We are as much a customer of Europe as we are an exporter. We’ve got to know what the trade terms will look like and just get on with it now.“We also have a very large European workforce who need clarity on  they can stay.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee man steven caulker eyes wigan athletic deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee defender Steven Caulker is hoping to win a deal with Wigan Athletic just weeks after triggering a release clause at Dens.The 26-year-old still had a year left on his contract with the Dark Blues when he left on deadline day.It came just four months after the club had reportedly rejected a seven-figure offer from Rosenborg for the former England international.Caulker was a marquee signing for Neil McCann when he penned an 18-month contract with Dundee in January.Now he is training with Championship side Wigan ahead of a potential deal.Latics boss Paul Cook will run the rule over Caulker before deciding  he’s worth having on board.Aston Villa are also looking for a central defender and have been linked with the big centre-half, who earlier this month was reportedly training with Ukrainian Premier League Arsenal Kiev, managed by Fabrizio Ravanelli.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5baa14a3a5de1.jpg ","title":"george cran dundee can get out of this mess theyve done it before","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOn the whole, no points by this stage of the season brings about relegation. Dundee will be hoping they can buck the trend – and they do have some form for it.Try to recall horric starts in the top flight for clubs – St Mirren in 2014, Livingston in 2005, Hamilton 1989, Dumbarton 1984 and Morton 1987 – and they all end in the same horror show of the drop.In 2014, the Buddies had to wait till their sixth game before picking up points, ending in bottom spot with 30 points. Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton boss martin canning wont be shed a tear for under pressure dundee counterpart neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHamilton boss Martin Canning insists he cannot afford to take any notice of Neil McCann’s plight ahead of Saturday’s clash with bottom side Dundee.Pressure is piling on the Dens Park manager after six straight Ladbrokes Premiership defeats and a Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United.However, Canning noted his side beat St Mirren 3-0 at home on Saturday for their first win in four matches, to give Accies some respite of their own.He said: “You’ve got to go and do your own job and my job on Saturday is to try to get Hamilton Accies three points and  we can do that we’ll be delighted.“That’s just football.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past 24 years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

They heard there is a stigma associated with talking about loneliness and isolation but people of all ages are at risk of being lonely. It often occurs at times of change in people’s lives such as leaving home, starting a family, retirement or bereavement.A recent survey over the whole of NHS Highland, including Mid Argyll, found that 67 per cent of older people sometimes feel lonely and for eight per cent of respondents this increased to often feeling extremely lonely.Cumlodden Guild signed up to NHS Highland’s campaign called Reach Out – make a dference to someone who’s lonely, making a pledge to raise awareness in the church congregation and to talk about loneliness and isolation in their local communities.Alison McGrory said: \u0026#8216My job is about preventing health problems before they arise and enabling people to lead as healthy a le as possible. Loneliness is a bigger public health risk than physical activity or weight management and causes as many premature deaths as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This is a compelling reason to take action.\u0026#8216NHS Highland’s Reach Out campaign has been developed to encourage more people to think about the part they can play in reducing loneliness. It costs nothing to reach out a hand of kindness and say hello to someone in the street or knock on a neighbour’s door to check they are OK.\u0026#8216You can sign up to the Reach Out campaign on facebook at NHS Highland Reach Out.\u0026#8217Sue Campbell of Cumlodden Church Guild said: \u0026#8216Cumlodden Church Guild is delighted to sign up to the Reach Out campaign. We are aware that isolation is an issue throughout Mid Argyll – some people live alone and others live in remote areas and find it dficult to get out and about. We are all now much more aware of the health issues associated with loneliness and are going to spread the word amongst our wider congregation and with our friends and neighbours.\u0026#8217PIC:Members have reached out to anyone suffering from loneliness or isolation. no_a39CumloddenLoneliness01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley banks crinan canal exhibit featured in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 27/09/18, 9:39 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGlasgow School of Art graduate Lesley Banks was honoured at the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead on Friday September 21, with an exhibit and sale of her work.Banks\u0026#8217 work in this exhibit mainly focuses on the Crinan Canal, painted over this past summer spent in Mid Argyll, walking from one end of the canal to the other, admiring the water.Lesley said: \u0026#8216Water has always intrigued me as a painter.

When given the all-clear, he had taken up cycling to regain full fitness and continues to cover many miles on two wheels each week. Laura Brown, income and marketing manager for Ayrshire Cancer Support, said: “Despite not liking to ask anyone for money, George collected \u0026pound300, including \u0026pound130 on the road during his arduous cycle the  of the UK. “I’m sure when people know that he has undertaken this huge cycle in aid of Ayrshire Cancer Support, they will be only too delighted to dig deep and show their support. “We are grateful for the support of all fundraisers, whose generosity is crucial to the services we provide for those affected by cancer. “George pulled out all the stops to benefit Ayrshire Cancer Support and it is thanks to him that we can continue supporting families all across Ayrshire affected by cancer.” People can donate to George’s appeal by sending cheques or donating directly to Ayrshire Cancer Support at 22 Wellington Square, Ayr.

Mark Crane insists the rising star from Buckinghamshire will curb his temper during this week\u0027s clash in Paris. It comes as the spotlight shines on Europe\u0027s underdogs and their ability to perform against a formidable American line-up. But Crane, who has proved a lethal partner for Hatton since taking his bag earlier this year, believes Hatton will thrive in the Paris pressure cooker. He said: People have a perception of Tyrrell from the TV and view him as a fiery character. Away from that he\u0027s actually quite dferent and we get on incredibly well, which is why it works on the course. He wears his heart on his sleeve and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that. I guess I\u0027m there as the calming influence! The pair have joined forces to register top ten finishes in the US Open and PGA Championship this season. And Crane, 36, who runs Prestwick\u0027s Bar Central, is expecting another big performance. He said: Everyone is tipping the Americans but I’m not sure why they’re favourites. The Europeans know this course well and being accurate off the tee will be vital. Do the Americans have a formidable looking team? Sure. But we also have plenty of guys at the top of their game and it\u0027s going to be an incredible contest.  The appearance marks Crane\u0027s second Ryder Cup, following his debut in 2016 at Hazeltine carrying the bag of Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Barassie greenkeeper Kerr Rowan is among an army of 180 course staff working at Le Golf National. The 39-year-old, now a course manager in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “It’s a huge honour. “Any golf fan would give their right arm to be involved in what is the pinnacle of our sport. “The rough is long and will undoubtedly favour the Europeans. “But you look at the line-up coming across from America and have to say they are worthy favourites.” Kerr, who grew up playing Royal Troon, has been drafted in by friend, Alejandro Reyes, who is course manager at the Ryder Cup venue. Kerr said: “This will be the second Ryder Cup I’ve worked at and nothing compares to the event. “I’m on holes two, three, 13 and 14 and some of the stuff they’ve done with the course is incredible. “It’s been totally stripped back and rebuilt just for this week.” The event kicks off on Friday and is live on Sky Sports from 6.30am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRyder CupTroonPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"silver-success-for-selkirk-band-at-uk-championships","story":"MEMBERS of Selkirk Silver Band did the Borders and Scotland proud at the weekend by recording their highest-ever finish at the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain, writes John Smail.\nThe 2018 finals were again staged in the Centaur auditorium at Cheltenham Racecourse, and in keeping with their famous equestrian surroundings, it was no surprise Selkirk\u0026rsquos band members played like the true thoroughbreds they are.\nSelkirk last reached the UK national finals in 2016, finishing in 10th place.\nIn the weeks of rehearsal leading up to this year\u0026rsquos contest, it became clear the Selkirk players\u0026rsquo focus was on bettering that 10th placing.\nIn the draw to decide in what order the 18 competing Section 3 bands would perform the test piece, Episodes for Brass, by Gareth Churcher - Selkirk came out of the hat as the 14th to play.\nThe long wait to see the Souters take the stage proved worth it for the enthusiastic supporters in the audience, for Selkirk Silver Band\u0026rsquos members gave a typically confident and polished display.\nWhen the full results were finally announced late on Sunday afternoon, Selkirk had indeed improved on its 2016 position by being awarded eighth place.\nBandmaster Colin Kemp said he didn\u0026rsquot think the band could have played the piece any better, while conductor Stuart Black said: \u0026ldquoAll the soloists played really well, and we did what we came here to do, which was to come off the stage happy.\nHorn player Emma Scott was equally elated: \u0026ldquoIt was a real team effort, and I\u0026rsquom really chuffed with eighth place.\n\"The judges decided we\u0026rsquore the eighth-best Section 3 band in the whole of Britain, so what more could you want?\nThe adjudicators singled out Selkirk\u0026rsquos soprano cornet player Stuart Kemp for special praise as the band\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquostar\u0026rsquo player.\nScotland had a total of seven bands competing across the four musical sections - Section 1: Johnstone Silver , Dunaskin Doon .

making them a fresher option than buying from supermarkets.\nTilly Fuller, general mnager at Borderfields Oils, spoke of her desire to maintain a local connection for the 11 year old company, which

the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that

Merkel\u0026rsquos spokesman Steffen Seibert said.\n\u0026ldquoWe have a fundamental interest \u0026hellip in an economically and politically stable Turkey, and of course in a Turkey in which democracy is practised, Mr Seibert added.\nHe said that talks with Mr Erdogan will address both \u0026ldquocommon interests and dficult issues.\nIn an opinion piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Mr Erdogan said it was time to \u0026ldquoset aside our dferences of opinion and concentrate on our joint interests.\n\u0026ldquoTurkey\u0026rsquos hope is to develop relations with Germany and other nations as equals on the basis of mutual respect, he wrote.\nMrs Merkel championed a 2016 agreement with Turkey designed to halt the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe, which has held up even as relations between Ankara and the European Union soured.\nAnd Berlin considers Turkey an important partner in trying to end the conflict in neighbouring Syria.\nPeople wait for the arrival of Turkey\u0026rsquos president near a hotel in Berlin \nBut there has been a series of setbacks to bilateral ties.\nAmong the irritants has been a 2016 German parliament resolution labelling the early 20th century killing of Armenians in Turkey as \u0026ldquogenocide.\nTurkish officials\u0026rsquo attempts to rally support among their citizens living in Germany last year in a referendum over whether to expand Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos power caused widespread irritation, and several of their public events were cancelled \u0026ndash prompting the Nazi jibes from Mr Erdogan.\nMost damaging was the jailing of Germans amid mass arrests and firings by Turkish authorities following a July 2016 coup attempt.\nGermany\u0026rsquos foreign ministry says 35 were imprisoned on what Berlin considers political grounds.\nWhile the most prominent \u0026ndash including two journalists \u0026ndash have been released, five remain in Turkish custody.\nIn recent months, officials in both countries have sought to thaw relations \u0026ndash particularly on the economic front, something that has gained urgency as Turkey grapples with a currency crisis heightened by tensions with the US over the case of a detained American pastor.\nWhile Berlin has said the question of German aid for Turkey \u0026ldquodoes not currently arise and emphasised the need for Turkey\u0026rsquos bank to be independent, it has made clear that it does not want an economic basket case on Europe\u0026rsquos doorstep.\nMr Erdogan landed in Berlin on Thursday but has the bulk of his public engagements on Friday, when he will meet Mrs Merkel and attend a state banquet hosted by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier \u0026ndash an event that many German opposition politicians are refusing to attend.\nDemonstrations against the Turkish leader are expected in both Berlin and Cologne, and Amnesty International called for Mrs Merkel to use her meetings with Mr Erdogan to address the \u0026ldquodramatic human rights situation in Turkey.\n\u0026ldquoIn such a situation, a state visit must be used to advocate clearly for all arbitrarily and innocently imprisoned people, the organisation said.\nPolice in Berlin shut down a large area around the chancellery where Mrs Merkel was to meet with Mr Erdogan, including the airspace and boat traffic on the Spree river.\n.push,i[r].l=1*new Datea=s.createElement,m=s.getElementsByTagName[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBeforegagagagagagagagagaga, \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Turkey\\u2019s Erdogan arrives in

Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.  Mr Lindgren\u0026rsquos funeral at Musselburgh Congregational Church and Seafield Crematorium was well attended by the community of Musselburgh and Fisherrow.  Representatives from many organisations he was associated with, including Musselburgh Rotary Club, Musselburgh Air Cadets and Fisherrow Yacht Club, were present to pay their last respects."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-volunteers-to-join-the-team-at-musselburgh-cab","story":"  Claire Grehan, volunteer support officer, said sometimes there could be three or four volunteer advisers on duty but the busy High Street office was down to just one that day. The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.  The next adviser training programme starts on Thursday, October 4.  Anyone interested in getting involved should pick up an application form from the CAB, which is located on High Street.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

They found about the historical link from Ian Wood, former sub-postmaster at Levenhall, after he spotted information online about the four-time Open winner.  Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer. However, this was news to him and his we Audrey so I passed them copies of what I\u0026rsquod found.  Mr Inglis made contact with Historic Scotland which supported his request to have the plaque installed on the front of their house.  And Mr Inglis, who has lived in the house 34 years, said: \u0026ldquoWe are quite proud to tell people about it. It is good to support Musselburgh\u0026rsquos heritage and do everything you can to attract people to the town.  \u0026ldquoI have been up to the loft to see  there are any of Willie Park senior\u0026rsquos putters but there are none!  In a twist of fate, Mr Wood\u0026rsquos daughter and son-in-law live on Park Drive, Wallyford, which was named after Willie Park senior, a four-time winner of The Open.  Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoI think the plaque is a fitting tribute to Willie Park senior.  He suggested that it would be good to see some kind of golfing trail, with accompanying leaflet, produced for the Honest Toun.  A successful golf exhibition, curated by the great-grandson of Willie Park senior, Mungo Park, was held at Musselburgh Museum in the summer. He was in the town again last week to give a talk on Musselburgh\u0026rsquos importance in the history of the sport.  He said: \u0026ldquoMusselburgh Museum\u0026rsquos exhibition has just restored some of the town\u0026rsquos proper reputation in golf history.  \u0026ldquoI am grateful to the owners of Laurel Bank and to Historic Scotland for giving my great-grandfather a singular place in that history. There are many others in the town whose story is as rich, and I hope that Musselburgh\u0026rsquos position as the 19th century\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquohome of golf\u0026rsquo will come to be more widely understood."},{"url":null,"title":"sisters-set-to-raise-four-figure-sum","story":"  Musselburgh resident Veronica Noone, 57, took part in the September 9 event along with her sister Trisha Francis, 56, from Manchester, in aid of the charity Crohn\u0026rsquos \u0026amp Colitis UK after family members were diagnosed with the conditions.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now. He has also become a leading light in the Musselburgh Athletic FC\u0026rsquos 1934 Club.  Alistair was a director for 20 years of the now defunct Musselburgh Fair Day Association which ran the annual trotting at Musselburgh racecourse. He also ran a youth club for a number of years in Northesk Church and was chairman of the Musselburgh Domino League for a few years.  In August,Yard of Ale played a fundraiser for Musselburgh Athletic Football Club to help them achieve their transition to senior football.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

The trip is Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos first formal state visit to Germany, which is home to more than three million people with Turkish roots.  But the increasingly authoritarian leader is viewed with suspicion across the political spectrum in Germany, which has had dficult relations with Ankara in recent years.  They escalated in the past year to the point where Mr Erdogan called Germany\u0026rsquos mainstream parties \u0026ldquoenemies of Turkey and accused German officials of acting like Nazis, prompting Chancellor Angela Merkel to condemn the Turkish president\u0026rsquos words.  At the same time, the two countries recognise mutual strategic interests and the two leaders appeared prepared to bury the hatchet ahead of the trip, which runs until Saturday.  \u0026ldquoTurkey is an important partner for us and it is also an important partner for Europe, Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos spokesman Steffen Seibert said.  \u0026ldquoWe have a fundamental interest \u0026hellip in an economically and politically stable Turkey, and of course in a Turkey in which democracy is practised, Mr Seibert added.  He said that talks with Mr Erdogan will address both \u0026ldquocommon interests and dficult issues.  In an opinion piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Mr Erdogan said it was time to \u0026ldquoset aside our dferences of opinion and concentrate on our joint interests.  \u0026ldquoTurkey\u0026rsquos hope is to develop relations with Germany and other nations as equals on the basis of mutual respect, he wrote.  Mrs Merkel championed a 2016 agreement with Turkey designed to halt the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe, which has held up even as relations between Ankara and the European Union soured.  And Berlin considers Turkey an important partner in trying to end the conflict in neighbouring Syria.  But there has been a series of setbacks to bilateral ties.  Among the irritants has been a 2016 German parliament resolution labelling the early 20th century killing of Armenians in Turkey as \u0026ldquogenocide.  Turkish officials\u0026rsquo attempts to rally support among their citizens living in Germany last year in a referendum over whether to expand Mr Erdogan\u0026rsquos power caused widespread irritation, and several of their public events were cancelled \u0026ndash prompting the Nazi jibes from Mr Erdogan.  Most damaging was the jailing of Germans amid mass arrests and firings by Turkish authorities following a July 2016 coup attempt.  Germany\u0026rsquos foreign ministry says 35 were imprisoned on what Berlin considers political grounds.  While the most prominent \u0026ndash including two journalists \u0026ndash have been released, five remain in Turkish custody.  In recent months, officials in both countries have sought to thaw relations \u0026ndash particularly on the economic front, something that has gained urgency as Turkey grapples with a currency crisis heightened by tensions with the US over the case of a detained American pastor.  While Berlin has said the question of German aid for Turkey \u0026ldquodoes not currently arise and emphasised the need for Turkey\u0026rsquos bank to be independent, it has made clear that it does not want an economic basket case on Europe\u0026rsquos doorstep.  Mr Erdogan landed in Berlin on Thursday but has the bulk of his public engagements on Friday, when he will meet Mrs Merkel and attend a state banquet hosted by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier \u0026ndash an event that many German opposition politicians are refusing to attend.  Demonstrations against the Turkish leader are expected in both Berlin and Cologne, and Amnesty International called for Mrs Merkel to use her meetings with Mr Erdogan to address the \u0026ldquodramatic human rights situation in Turkey.  \u0026ldquoIn such a situation, a state visit must be used to advocate clearly for all arbitrarily and innocently imprisoned people, the organisation said.  Police in Berlin shut down a large area around the chancellery where Mrs Merkel was to meet with Mr Erdogan, including the airspace and boat traffic on the Spree river."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8741099.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"1m-pledged-to-help-marys-meals-feed-children-in-malawi","story":"  Mary\u0026rsquos Meals has been pledged the funding as part of an agreement between the two countries\u0026rsquo governments.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

It has strong association with the renowned Scottish poet Robert Burns, who wrote several pieces specically for its stage.  The theatre saw multiple changes of ownership during the first half of the 20th Century, before being bought by the Guild of Players in 1959.    The Guild managed to secure support from new sources and instead of planning on building new facilities upwards, they looked towards expanding outwards. Adjacent buildings were purchased, and renovation work began in 2014, completed by the end of 2015. The newly refurbished building includes several new spaces while maintaining many of the historic features, ushering Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest theatre into the 21st Century.  Attend one of the touring productions presented throughout the year, which includes live music, stand-up comedy and theatrical dramas. The Guild of Players presents a regular season of four shows, as well as a family-friendly Christmas pantomime.    Grab a drink at the bar before the show or enjoy a mean from the customised theatre menus at nearby restaurants. Want to get hands-on at the theatre? You can participate in one of the workshops or join our group of fantastic volunteers and help build sets and design costumes.  Getting there:  The Theatre Royal is located on the edge of Dumfries\u0026rsquo main shopping district, a short walk from the Dumfries railway station. It\u0026rsquos a 1.5-hour train journey to Dumfries from Glasgow or just under one hour\u0026rsquos drive from Carlisle Airport.

From family portraits to pet portraits and landscapes, Jane uses only the highest quality materials. Once completed, she can arrange for work to be framed to suit inidual preferences.

And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion. Change happens, it always does, but over these last years we wanted to light a fire under change, to turbo-charge its engine \u0026ndash all we\u0026rsquove really done is blow the bloody doors off the car."},{"url":null,"title":"new-22m-plan-to-revamp-scottish-art-displays-at-national-gallery-revealed","story":"  When Sir John Leighton became director general of the National Galleries of Scotland in 2006, he called the windowless, dingy display of art there an \u0026ldquoapology and was \u0026ldquodeeply unhappy about it.  He once referred to the concrete, subterranean galleries, opened in 1978, as \u0026ldquoan enduring weakness.  : More details and images of the revamp at the Galleries  Now, 12 years later, and after at least one false start - and accompanied by a \u0026pound5m rise in cost - the redevelopment of the National Gallery will begin next month, a three year project costing \u0026pound22m, to be completed by 2021.  The project was put on a \u0026ldquopause last March when the galleries\u0026rsquo first plan faced spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a man made hill, in a major public park, under an A-listed building and above one of Scotland\u0026rsquos major railway lines.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the entire gallery space.  The changes from the first plan mean that the new gallery spaces will stay not extend the facade five metres into East Princes Street Gardens, as previously planned, although it will feature a newly revamped entrance and pathways.  Sir John said he is confident that more than \u0026pound10m in funding, yet to be announced, can be secured.  : How, after a rethink, new National Gallery will be made  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat we have now is fully contracted price, and  we had pressed ahead with the original scheme, it would have been considerably more than \u0026pound22m.  \u0026ldquoSo we took the dficult decision to revise the project and recast it, and personally I think what we have now is a stronger concept.  Sir John added: \u0026ldquoThe rest of the cost comes from fundraising, and we have a substantial amount of that already, so I am confident that will be able to raise that. There is a signicant amount in already, and there is somewhere to go.  He added that he was \u0026ldquovery confident the project would be completed on budget.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street.  For the next two years the traders who work in the route to the Playfair steps during the Festival will not be present.  The new galleries, with six large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \u0026ldquobroader look at Scottish art.  : How the \u0027pause\u0027 in revamp\u0026nbspwas revealed in 2017  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter, Raeburn and the Scottish Colourists Peploe and Cadell.  The plan will involve \u0026ldquoextensive new landscaping in the gardens, a large lt for art and people, as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \u0026ldquodedicate family day one day a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, with new steps and paths by next spring.  : Arts News on Bloody Scotland success  Funds announced for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5.5m.  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said visitor numbers to the gallery have almost \u0026ldquodoubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.  She added: \u0026ldquoVisitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of displays designed expressly to engage them."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-blames-procurement-process-on-flu-jab-shortage","story":"  Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick told MSP that NHS National Service Scotland ordered its vaccine before expert advisers recommended changing to a new strain.

These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: \"Those are the words of the motion that was supported by the National Executive and the Shadow Cabinet and that is what is being voted on in conference\u0026hellip  \"Keir put that in because it\u0027s what\u0027s there in the motion. We will challenge this Government. If they don\u0027t meet our six tests, we will vote against it, and then we will take it from there, he declared.  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over the nature of a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell insisted Remain would not be part of the question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote conference speech yesterday he again claimed not only had Remain to be an option in any future referendum but no-one, including the Shadow Chancellor, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  After the Brexit debate, delegates approved by a show of hands the proposed motion, which, in the event of the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plan failing to get MPs\u0026rsquo support, called for a general election with the option of a second referendum  one did not happen.  The vast majority were in favour of the motion with only a small number against."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-cities-report-has-come-at-the-right-time","story":"  On the face of it, there are no startling revelations in \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Urban Age, a report produced by law firm Burness Paull into the future of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh. We know, for example, that Aberdeen must find a way to reduce its reliance on oil and gas, Glasgow needs to persuade more people to live within the city centre as it transitions from industrial to knowledge-based economy, and that higher-speed, more-efficient transport links are required to connect not just the big cities, but other parts of the country too. We also know there is an issue with low productivity which is crying out to be addressed \u0026ndash a problem which has blighted the UK economy as a whole in the decade since the financial crash.  However, with so much of city le challenged by the current economic conditions, notably on the embattled high street, the report\u0026rsquos arrival is timely.  The authors look to stimulate debate on what is needed to propel Scotland\u0026rsquos AGE cities  to a new era of growth and, to that end, offers interesting food for thought.  Among the more eye-catching ideas is to connect Edinburgh  with Belfast and Dublin through with a \u0026ldquoCeltic version of the Oresund Bridge, which connects Sweden and Denmark. Such a connection should be backed with fast links to Aberdeen via Dundee, so the benefits are felt throughout the country. The report also makes an interesting call for more powers to be devolved to the AGE cities to develop their own futures, citing Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which is said to enjoy far more autonomy than any city in Scotland.  Some may dismiss such concepts as impractical blue-sky thinking. But with Brexit around the corner, and no certainty on what that will bring, the time for bold thinking is now."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-labour-figures-distance-themselves-from-peoples-vote-option","story":"  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, made clear the party would not include a new referendum in its manesto  a general election were called before March.  Her colleague Richard Burgon said  Labour were in power now it would be negotiating a Brexit deal.  The comments came after Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, on Tuesday won a standing ovation from Labour conference delegates when he said \"nobody is ruling out Remain as an option\" in a fresh vote.  The event in Liverpool voted overwhelmingly to keep the option of a new vote \"on the table\", after he explicitly said it could include the option of staying in the EU.  Mrs Long-Bailey told BBC Radio 5 Live that Sir Keir\u0027s motion, hammered out after a late-night meeting, respected the 2016 referendum result.  Asked  a new vote would be among a list of manesto pledges  Theresa May sent the country to the polls before Brexit day in March, the Salford MP replied: \"No\".  She added that a second referendum was \"hypothetical\", adding: \"What we have said is that, in a very extreme set of circumstances, nothing should be ruled out, and that includes a People\u0027s Vote.\"  The Shadow Secretary of State said it was not impossible Labour would vote to support a deal made by the Prime Minister but added the party was a \u0026ldquolong way away\" from anything it could back being produced.  Mr Burgon said Labour\u0027s policy remained that \"we accept and respect the outcome of the referendum\".  Asked on LBC radio about Sir Keir leaving open the door to a second poll, the Shadow Justice Secretary said: \"Who knows where history is going to go? The Labour Party isn\u0027t calling for a second referendum.  \"Labour has our own vision of Brexit, respecting, accepting the outcome of the referendum.\"  Fellow MP Graham Stringer, a Leave supporter, warned there could be \"real electoral peril\"  the EU referendum result was not implemented.  He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that Sir Keir\u0027s motion was a \"classic Labour Party conference fudge\".  However, Tom Watson, the deputy leader, backed the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  Asked who spoke for the Labour Party on Brexit, Mr Watson told Today: \"Well, very thankfully, for me personally, it\u0027s Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, and he did a brilliant speech yesterday the conference united around him.  \"So, we come of this conference very united with a Brexit position and that will probably be in stark contrast to the Tory conference next week,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-universities-slip-down-global-rankings","story":"  Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews all lost ground in the latest Times Higher Education rankings of the top 200 universities in the world - while Dundee dropped out altogether.  The only university to buck the downward trend was Aberdeen, which jumped from 185th to 158th.  Scotland now has only four universities in the global top 200, compared to five last year, with Edinburgh in 29th place, Glasgow in 93rd, Aberdeen 158th and St Andrews 165th.  Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, which represents principals, warned investment was falling behind international competitors.  The sector has raised concerns in recent years that public funding does not support the full cost of running courses - leaving universities having to raise money by recruiting international students or those from the rest of the UK who pay fees.  Times Higher Education also raised concerns over the impact of Brexit with uncertainties over recruitment of the students and academics from across the EU.  Mr Sim said: \"Despite our commitment to excellence, we\u0026rsquove seen an overall fall in rankings for Scottish institutions. This reflects the ferocity of international competition from nations that are investing in higher education to drive economic growth.  \"A clear pattern is emerging between the level of resource available to higher education sectors by country and the trajectory of that country within global league tables.  \"This year, we\u0026rsquove seen Japan overtake the UK as the second most-represented nation in the rankings for the first time. We\u0026rsquove also seen Scotland\u0026rsquos number of universities in the top 200 drop from five to four.\"  Mr Sim called for sustainable investment to preserve Scotland\u0026rsquos \"critical advantage\" as a place to study, research and do business.  Richard Lochhead, the Higher Education Minister, praised Scotland\u0027s overall performance, but also highlighted uncertainties over Brexit.  He said: \"By head of population, Scotland has more universities in the top 200 than any other country except Switzerland underlining the strength and breadth of our higher education institutions.  \u0026ldquoIt is however worrying that Times Higher Education highlights that, in the face of growing global competition, Brexit poses a risk to the performance of our universities and suggests the UK will struggle to attract the best international talent and build productive research partnerships due to isolationism.\"  Aberdeen University welcomed the new rankings highlighting its strong recent performance in research.  Marion Campbell, vice-principal for research said: \u0026ldquoAt our core we are a research-led institution placing world class research, teaching and innovation at the centre of all our activities.  \u0026ldquoOur progress into the world\u0026rsquos top 160 reflects the excellent global impact in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.\"  Glasgow University said it was pleased to remain in the top 200 despite a decline from 80th to 93rd.  A spokeswoman said: \"The university remains committed to excellence in teaching and research, and to strengthening the international reputation we have established in the higher education sector.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said, \u0026ldquoWhile we are disappointed to have dropped out of the world\u0026rsquos top 200, it should be noted that our position among UK universities remains largely unchanged.

Kevin Hobbs, chief executive of Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd , told MSPs that responsibility for the extra costs lay squarely with Mr McColl\u0026rsquos shipbuilding firm.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more\u0026hellip that is not our problem, he said.  Mr Hobbs also appeared to take a swipe at Mr McColl, saying pointedly that CMAL had been \u0026ldquoextremely honourable and hadn\u0026rsquot \u0026ldquomoaned and groaned about the contract in the press.  Mr McColl gave an interview to this week\u0026rsquos Sunday Times in which he said he was on the verge of taking CMAL to court over design-related delays.  The ships are being built by Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, which Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire bought out of administration in 2014.  The vessels should have been delivered this year, increasing capacity on the Ardrossan to Arran route and Uig triangle, but have been delayed to next summer and spring 2020.  Since the delays first emerged in July 2017, the Scottish Government has loaned Ferguson\u0027s \u0026pound45m of taxpayers\u0026rsquo money to ensure the yard\u0026rsquos continued \u0026ldquoviability.  Amid growing concern at Holyrood over the arrangement, Mr McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, put blame on CMAL.  He told the Sunday Times: \"The construction process is slower because the ferries are prototypes. Because of this there have been additional costs which we have funded and which CMAL have refused to discuss. This is what has necessitated the loans from the Scottish government. CMAL\u0027s attitude has put our business under pressure.\"  He added: \"I\u0027m very frustrated with CMAL. They should have carried out more design and development work on this project before they put it out to tender.\"  However Mr Hobbs was emphatic that Ferguson\u0027s had bid for and signed a \u0026ldquofixed price design and build contract, and CMAL did not intend to pay any more.  He said: \u0026ldquoFerguson Marine along with everybody else bidding for that contract at the time, they\u0026rsquore private companies, and with a private company there\u0026rsquos risk and reward.  \u0026ldquoThey signed up to that contract knowingly and willingly, and as far as we\u0026rsquore concerned \u0026pound97m is what we have to pay.  \u0026ldquoWe can judge that it will be costing an awful lot more. Our assertion at this particular point in time is that is not our problem.  \u0026ldquoThat is the problem of a private company that knowingly and willingly bid for these vessels.\"  He added: \u0026ldquoWe feel we\u0026rsquove been extremely honourable. We haven\u0026rsquot gone to the press. We haven\u0026rsquot moaned and groaned.  Mr Hobbs suggested CMAL might not even pay the \u0026pound97m, as the contract allowed for \u0026ldquoliquidated damages, or compensation, for missed delivery dates and quality issues.  There are a number of things at the end of the contract which we will have to weigh up.  Mr Hobbs also said that although the two \u0026ldquodual-fuel vessels were the first of their kind built in the UK, they were not new technology, with 2000 such engines bought worldwide.  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos complaint was also challenged by CMAL director of vessels Jim Anderson.  He said Ferguson\u0027s had tabled the \u0026ldquooutstanding bid for the dual-fuel ferries on quality and cost grounds, demonstrating the firm \u0026ldquocompletely understood what was expected.  Labour MSP Colin Smyth asked  CMAL was to blame for signicant design changes.  Mr Anderson replied: \u0026ldquoThere have been no signicant changes in design. That\u0026rsquos quite clear. So what you\u0026rsquore reading is untrue.  Pressed on the cause of the delays and cost overruns, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos one you would really have to ask Ferguson\u0026rsquos. We have a clear contract.  \u0026ldquoIf any project which had a timescale of 31 months and 33 months is now being extended to 44 months and 52 months, of course there\u0026rsquos going to be cost overruns. It\u0026rsquos quite clear that  a project takes almost twice as it was envisaged, there will be cost overruns.\"  Asked  any cost overruns were related to design, Mr Anderson said: \u0026ldquoNone whatsoever.  CalMac managing director Robbie Drummond told MSPs it would have made a \"signicant dference\" to services  the new ships had been delivered on time.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re as disappointed as our communities are that that has been delayed.\"  Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP knew about problems and cost overruns on the yet to be delivered two new CalMac ferries over 15 months ago but chose to say nothing to Parliament, instead a secret backdoor loan was given to the manufacturer.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos nothing short of a complete farce.

After the Liverpool People\u0026rsquos Choir set the mood with the comradely anthem of \u0026ldquoHe ain\u0026rsquot heavy, he\u0026rsquos my brother, the roof almost came off the Liverpool auditorium as delegates shouted, whooped and cheered to greet the shimmering arrival of the Reverend Jeremy.  Needless to say, another anthem struck up immediately as JC slowly breathed in wave after wave of Labour adulation: \u0026ldquoOooooh Jeremy Corbyn! Oooooh Jeremy Corbyn!  One happy-clappy comrade a few seats down was clad in Labour red, including a red bowler hat. He was dancing around as  Labour had already won the election.  Of course, the party leader had to begin his Socialist sermon by thanking the workers \u0026ndash who else? - who had made the conference possible.  And to settle the troops down, there was a joke at Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos expense naturally.  Insisting, unlike the Tories who got their money from dodgy donors and shoddy business clubs, Labour\u0026rsquos funds came from ordinary honest types, Jezza insisted: \u0026ldquoSo I don\u0026rsquot have to play tennis with an oligarch. Labour trades in hope for the many, not favours for the few.  Another target was, of course, the Tory propagandists of HM Press.  The Reverend Jeremy insisted the freedom of the press had to be protected and pointed to noble Turkish and Colombian journalists who had been imprisoned for holding authoritarian governments to account.  But, of course, British journalists were dferent. Hiss. The free press here too often meant the freedom to spread lies and to \u0026ldquosmear the powerless, not take on the powerful. Hiss.  He denounced the Press\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopropaganda of privilege and said it could be challenged by ordinary folk taking to social media.  Jezza insisted Labour was \u0026ldquoready to take charge and appealed to the comrades to show solidarity and unity. When Labour was ided, he told the congregation, the only winners were the rich and their champion: the Tories.  There was an attempt to molly those in the Jewish community outraged by anti-Semitism within the party as the leader, his voice reducing to almost a whisper, recognised their \u0026ldquoimmense hurt and anxiety, and insisted the Labour movement would be \u0026ldquoimplacable campaigners against all racism.  And the Socialist hero went on the attack, lambasting the Tories for backing the right-wing authoritarian government of Hungary\u0026rsquos Viktor Orban, and of creating the \u0026ldquohostile environment that created the Windrush scandal.  This, declared Jezza, was a \u0026ldquonasty, cynical politics, that demeans our whole country. And there was another bf to Bozza\u0026rsquos chin as he decried the former Foreign Secretary\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquodog-whistle jibe at Muslim women over the letter-box burka row.  But arguably the loudest rise in volume came when Jezza announced that a Labour government in its first year would recognise the state of Palestine. Delegates rose to their feet and several Palestinian flags were waved as the conference whooped and clapped their approval.  Of course, the subject that hangs over all of us made a late appearance.  Reverend Jeremy denounced Theresa May for wanting to create a post Brexit dystopia where the rich flourished in a low tax haven and workers saw their rights destroyed.  Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, was itching to privatise the NHS \u0026ldquowith a side order of chlorinated chicken.  Then the chief comrade raised another Tory bogeyman: Jacob Rees-Mogg. Boos echoed around the conference hall. The ardent Brexiteer, quipped Jezza, had expressed his personal faith in Brexit Britain by, er, deciding to base his new investment fund in the eurozone.  Touching oh-so-briefly on the Labour split on the People\u0026rsquos Vote, the hairy Leftie noted how Keir Starmer had negotiated an agreement on the subject between the party\u0026rsquos factions, saying how \u0026ldquogetting one in Brussels should be a piece of cake.  The final flourish had a central message: \u0026ldquowe\u0026rsquore ready to take charge. Labour, insisted Jezza, was offering a radical plan to transform and rebuild Britain into the New Jerusalem. \u0026ldquoTogether we can.  And that was it. As the screen behind Jezza showed people creating the message \u0026ldquoRebuilding Britain, there was an earthquake of cheering and clapping. The Socialist Messiah grinned broadly. More \u0026ldquoOoooh Jeremy Corbyn! chants.

The Scottish made thriller Calibre leads this year\u0026rsquos nominations, with five.  However there is no women in the best director categories for either factual or fiction, or the writer for film and television category.  : Trainspotting 2 triumphs at Bafta Scotland awards  Karen Gillan\u0026rsquos debut feature film as a writer and a director, The Party\u0026rsquos Just Beginning, is in the running for best feature film, as is the zombie comedy drama Anna and the Apocalypse and Nae Pasaran, the documentary about Scottish workers who helped sabotage the Chilean dictator General Pinochet.  Gillan\u0026rsquos film was produced by Claire Mundell, of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Synchronicity Films.

Palmer is also in the best writer category, as is Iannucci and David Kane, for Shetland.  : Iannucci given special award by BAFTA Scotland  BAFTA Scotland said that only 18% of entrants to the writer category were women, 21% of entrants to the director of fiction category, and 31% for the director of factual category.

Union leaders said the increase, equivalent to a 2.5 per cent rise over three years, would result in a real terms pay cut for lecturers.  However, college bosses hit out at the \u0026ldquointransigent approach to pay discussions.  In 2016 it was announced that lecturers would be able to earn up to \u0026pound40,000 under a new agreement to harmonise pay across the sector following a series of national mergers.  The employers side said the latest offer would take that to \u0026pound45,000 costing the sector at extra \u0026pound60 million.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, said: \u0026ldquoThis vote is an overwhelming rejection of the pay offer and signies the strength of feeling of our members.  \u0026ldquoThis dispute is about a cost of living pay rise and ensuring that lecturers\u0026rsquo pay keeps up with inflation.  \u0026ldquoAt a time when the sector would benefit from stability, it is regrettable that management are conflating the provision of equal pay with a cost of living pay increase, creating a barrier to further negotiation.  Mr Flanagan called on college managers to  with an improved offer to \u0026ldquoavoid the risk of industrial action.  A spokeswoman for the Colleges Scotland employers\u0026rsquo association said officials were \u0026ldquodisappointed, but not surprised at the move.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe union has continually refused to engage seriously in the process and has demanded a colossal pay increase on top of an extremely generous rise resulting from national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoA pay rise is a pay rise irrespective of how it is delivered, so it is deceptive to try and conveniently forget the huge increases and improvements in terms and conditions from national bargaining.  \u0026ldquoIf the union continues with their grandstanding and mendacious claims they would completely undermine the delivery of the college sector jeopardising jobs.  The ballot saw a 60 per cent turn-out with 90 per cent of members who voted supporting a rejection of the deal."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-minister-confirms-talks-with-peoples-vote-campaign","story":"  Michael Russell, the constitutional relations secretary, told MSPs he had \u0026ldquovery constructive discussions with the campaign\u0026rsquos Hugo Dixon on Wednesday morning.  However he said the government would not back another referendum without a guarantee that Scotland would not be taken out of Europe  there was a repeat of the 2016 result, when Scotland voted Remain but the UK as a whole voted Leave.  This is seen by the SNP\u0026rsquos critics as demanding a guarantee that a similar result would be interpreted as a vote for Scottish independence.  Mr Russell revealed the talks with the Mr Dixon after being goaded at Holyrood by Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie over the SNP\u0026rsquos failure to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  Mr Rennie said of Mr Russell: \u0026ldquoHe and I have had talks on several occasions.  \u0026ldquoTo be brutal, what he wants is he wants me to back independence  he backs a people\u0027s vote on Brexit. That\u0027s what he\u0027s trying to get to and that is not going to happen.  \u0026ldquoSo the Cabinet Secretary has a decision to make. Will he sit on the sidelines or will he get behind the best chance of stopping Brexit, which is a people\u0027s vote?  Mr Russell replied: \u0026ldquoFortunately there are more reasonable voices who are arguing for this.  \u0026ldquoFor example, I had very constructive discussions with Hugo Dixon from the People\u0027s Vote which was an interesting and informative step forward.  \"That is the type of constructive engagement I would commend.\"  He added: \"I did note that [Mr Rennie\u0026rsquos] party leader... Vince Cable, at the start of the Liberal Democrat conference, demanded the SNP back the people\u0027s vote but also demanded that the people of Scotland should never be allowed to support independence again.  \"That is no way to win friends and influence people.\"  The First Minister has repeatedly said she would not stand in the way of another vote, but has never endorsed one, possibly because it would set a precedent for independence.  But with Labour party conference voting to keep all options on the table  Brexit talks fail and there is no general election, the pressure on the SNP to sht position has increased."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-insists-labour-ready-to-take-charge-as-he-sets-out-socialist-vision-for-britain","story":"  To fervent applause from delegates at Labour\u0027s annual conference in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn called on Theresa May to call an early general election, which he said could see him in Downing Street by this time next year.  The Labour leader said his party was \"ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997 and would in power deliver \"a real alternative to the people of Britain a radical plan to rebuild and transform our country\".  At the conclusion of the four-day gathering, Mr Corbyn set out plans for:  *a \"green jobs revolution\" to create 400,000 skilled jobs in windfarms and home insulation  *workers\u0027 seats on company boards, and the creation of employee shareholding funds  *an end to the \"racket\" of privatisation and outsourcing  *public services with \"fairness and humanity\" at their heart  *a new tax on second homes in England to pay for house-building  *an extension of free childcare south of the border and  *a foreign policy driven by \"progressive values and international solidarity\", with no more \"reckless wars, like Iraq or Libya\".  Mr Corbyn declared: \"Change in our country is long overdue. Every month this Government remains in power, the worse things get  \"We will rebuild the public realm and create a genuinely mixed economy for the 21st century. And after a decade of austerity, the next Labour government will confront the challenge of rebuilding our public services.\"  At the end of a conference dominated by Brexit, Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour would vote against Theresa May\u0027s Chequers plan and keep the option of a second referendum on EU withdrawal \"on the table\".  But he left no doubt that a general election is his preferred outcome, sending a message to the Prime Minister: \"Brexit is about the future of our country and our vital interests. It is not about leadership squabbles or parliamentary posturing.  \"If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland,  you protect jobs, people\u0027s rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.  \"But  you can\u0027t negotiate that deal, then you need to make way for a party that can.\"  Mr Corbyn sought to draw a line under the anti-Semitism scandals which have dogged Labour over the summer, promising to \"eradicate anti-Semitism, both from our party and wider society\" and telling the Jewish community: \"We are your ally.\"  But he made clear that he would not back away from criticism of Israel, condemning illegal settlements and the detention of Palestinian children as an \"outrage\".  And he announced - to sustained applause and the waving of Palestinian flags - that a Labour government would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it took office.  He issued an appeal for unity to the feuding wings of his party and called for an end to abuse on social media.  In a riposte to critics who accuse him of narrowing Labour to a Leftist cult, he insisted the party must remain a \"broad church\" and declared: \"Our movement has achieved nothing when ided...We are on a journey together and can only complete it together.\"  Mr Corbyn denounced the \"greed-is-good capitalism\" which led to the financial crash of 2008 and the political and economic establishment which \"strained every sinew\" to shore up the system which created it.  \"We can no longer tolerate a set-up where the real economy, in which millions work, is just a sort of sideshow for the City of London and for banks fixated on piling up profits around the world,\" said the Labour leader.  \"Inequality is not just a matter of incomes. It\u0027s about having a real say too.  \"That\u0027s why we are not only determined to rebuild our economy, communities and public services, but also to democratise them, and change the way our economic system is run in the interests of the majority.\"  He spelt out plans for all private companies with 250 or more staff to reserve one-third of seats on their boards for workers and to transfer 10 per cent of their equity into shareholding funds delivering employees up to \u0026pound500 a year and granting them a voice in corporate decisions.  But he assured businesses Labour would also deliver \"what you need to succeed and to expand and modernise our economy - more investment in our transport, housing and digital infrastructure, more investment in education and skills, so workers are more productive\".  Warning of the rise of far-right politics around the world since the crash, Mr Corbyn said: \"People in this country know that the old way of running things isn\u0027t working any more. And unless we offer radical solutions, others will fill the gap with the politics of blame and ision.\"  He declared that Labour was winning the public debate and now represented \"the new political mainstream\" with \"an alternative to the politics of austerity, of social ision and of international conflict\".  And he won a standing ovation as he promised: \"Where the Tories have ided and ruled, we will unite and govern. We represent the new common sense of our time. And we are ready to deliver on it.  \"United and ready to win, ready to govern as we were in 1945, 1964 and 1997. So that when we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government.\"  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, claimed Mr Corbyn had shown at every turn how he was unfit to govern.  \u0026ldquoAll he offers are failed ideas that didn\u0026rsquot work in the past and would leave working families paying the price with higher taxes, more debt and more waste just like last time.  Mr Lewis said the Labour leader had confirmed the Opposition was \u0026ldquoopening the door to re-running the referendum, which, he added, \u0026ldquowould take us all back to square one.  Ian Blackford for the SNP claimed Labour offered Scotland nothing but \u0026ldquoeconomic chaos and incompetence.  The Highland MP said while Mr Corbyn might have been forced into saying he would not accept a no-deal Brexit, he remained committed, like the Tories, to taking Scotland out of the EU against its will and imposed a \u0026ldquoreckless plan to drag Scotland off a hard Brexit clf-edge.  He added: \u0026ldquoAfter a bitterly ided conference, dominated by rows over Brexit, racism, and sectarianism, Labour have shown they aren\u0026rsquot even fit for opposition let alone government.  Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said: \u0026ldquoOnly Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership could fudge Brexit this much. By refusing to unequivocally back campaigning for a final say on Brexit, Labour is committed to nothing.  The East Dunbartonshire MP added: \u0026ldquoThe public know where Corbyn\u0026rsquos heart lies on Brexit and they don\u0026rsquot trust him. He didn\u0026rsquot deliver in the referendum campaign, and he hasn\u0026rsquot offered any solutions since.

Two options to change kerbside waste collections are proposed as part of the revamped collection system and people are encouraged to share their views with the council on this.Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%.Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.                                                                                                        Sending waste to landfill costs twice as much as recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.Chairman of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee , Peter Argyle, said: “Clearly a signicant number of people have already given their views and as councillors we will of course take those into account when making what are important decisions about how we all deal with the waste we produce.“There are however around 118,000 households in Aberdeenshire who will be affected by these changes, so we’d be keen to have as many of their views as possible too.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"msp urges public to attend a96 exhibitions","story":"        Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin has called on the public to attend a series of exhibitions next month to have their say on initial options for the development of 26 mile section of the A96.

Among the areas in which the University was judged to have performed strongly include teaching quality, degree outcomes, and graduate prospects.                                                    The Guide has also acknowledged the University’s world-leading medical research, which was recognised earlier this year when Aberdeen was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize - the highest national honour for a UK university.        Other areas of strength include the University’s role in supporting the local and national economy through its energy-related teaching and research activities, recently demonstrated by the creation of a National Decommissioning Centre.The Guide has also taken into account Aberdeen’s activities in areas of importance including widening access, investment in facilities, student welfare, and internationalisation – the University opened its first overseas campus in Qatar last year.Professor George Boyne, Principal, said: “This is a major honour and a testament to the efforts of our staff and students, as well as the great sense of identity and community that we have at Aberdeen.“As an institution we consistently attract students with exceptional ability and potential, and this - along with the quality of our teaching - has been an important factor in our success in areas such as degree outcomes and graduate employability.                                                                                                         “In addition, our strength in research - exemplied by the Queens Anniversary Prize for our contribution to health services research - places us at the forefront of innovation in key areas of economic, environmental and societal importance.“This University was founded in 1495 with the purpose of being open to all and dedicated to the pursuit of truth in the service of others, and this continues to inspire our academic achievements.“Our focus on widening access and inclusivity, strength in interdisciplinary teaching and research, and international outlook are the modern-day interpretation of our founding principles, which have played a major role in Aberdeen being named Scottish University of the Year.“I’d like to congratulate everyone at the University who has worked so hard to help us achieve this honour.”                                                                                                        Alastair McCall, editor of The Sunday Times Good University Guide, said: \"Aberdeen\u0027s sharp rise up our league table this year is the biggest of any university in the top 30 and gives it a ranking commensurate to its status as one of the UK\u0027s leading academic institutions.\"It was a clear winner of our Scottish University of the Year award and earned a shortlisting for the UK University of the Year title off the back of improved performances in most of the metrics used in our tables.

He was aged only 29 but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July 26, 1833. His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank. He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

They should be commended for all their efforts.\u0026ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: \u0026ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.\u0026ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver elsewhere due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117725.jpg","title":"Businesses have lots to celebrate","story":"\u0026nbspCAITHNESS Chamber of Commerce celebrated another successful year for business in the North Highlands at its 46th annual dinner on Friday.Around 200 organisations were represented at the event in Wick\u0027s Norseman Hotel which again underlined the ersity of the local business community and showcased the opportunities the area has to offer.After a welcome from the chamber\u0027s chairman, Stephen Sutherland, and an opening speech from chamber patron Lord Thurso, guests heard a speech from Cathy Craig, commercial and memberships director of Entrepreneurial Scotland.Cathy spoke passionately about entrepreneurialism in Scotland and explained how her grandmother sparked her interest in business.

They then negotiate the turn up the Clf from River Street and can proceed as normal.All possible obstacles are temporarily repositioned and in the case of River Street this means folding over a hinged lamp-post so the blade tip doesn\u0027t hit it as the lorry turns.The three McFadyens trucks were monitored by the company\u0027s support vehicles and road policing officers.The Senvion MM92 turbine comes in eight pieces that the haulage company conveys to the site in convoys that never go beyond three lorries.Bad a\u0027 Cheo wind farm, which began construction in March 2017, will feature 13 of these 2.05MW turbines with a tip height of 112 metres.Thursday 27 Sep 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"September 27, 2018 at 11:00 amThe main street of Stromness is set to be viewed in a new light as researchers embark on a 3D scan project.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September 20 and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February 2019.Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”            • : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back 12 years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.            “I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest ?particularly from those who can’t wait until 2019 and the release of the final season of GoT.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4805859.1537988527!/image/image.jpg","title":"liz truss i played margaret thatcher at my primary school in paisley","story":"        When I moved to Scotland at the age of four, I was enrolled in the West Primary School in Paisley. A few years later, at the time of the 1983 general election, my teacher asked me  I wanted to play the role of Margaret Thatcher in our class equivalent. I jumped at the chance, and gave a heartfelt speech at the hustings, but ended up with zero votes. I didn\u0026#8217t even vote for myself \u0026#8211 even at that age, we knew it was simply unpopular to be a Tory in the West of Scotland.                 What a turnaround we have seen over the last few decades. We have a growing group of Conservative MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, meanwhile, Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, is polling ahead of Nicola Sturgeon. And we have been joined by 13 brilliant new Conservatives MPs in the UK Parliament. Being a Tartan Tory is back in vogue.            Having spent some of my most formative years here, I know that Scottish people have always been ambitious and entrepreneurial, inidual and innovative, leading the world in ideas and economic progress. If it weren’t for Scots, Conservatives wouldn’t have the ideas, the leaders or the legacy we have today.             In the 18th century, Scotland became an industrial powerhouse, exporting the best of the country to the four corners of the Earth. As time went by, Scotch whisky went global, Scottish tweeds went around the world, and Scottish salmon landed on plates from Asia to America. Paisley became famous the world over for that distinctive tear drop pattern. That national pride and that belief in commerce persists today.With Ruth Davidson offering a bold vision for Scotland’s families, communities, businesses and young people, the Scottish people have come home to a party that is positive about the future. The traditional building blocks of the Scottish economy remain important. For example, in 2017, we had record-breaking whisky exports, with 1.23 billion bottles exported globally, equivalent to £4.37 billion. Anyone who has seen the activity in Aberdeen harbour, where scores of boats come in and out every week, would know that oil and gas is still very important to the economy, supporting 280,000 jobs across the UK.But those powerhouses are being complemented by new industries and capabilities. Across Scotland, the services sector now contributes £50 billion a year to the UK economy. And Scottish exports are growing in all sectors. They were worth more than £28 billion in 2017, up from 2016 when they were worth £24 billion. In the first half of 2018 Scotland has already exported more than £14 billion goods, up on last year.            The innate Scottish intellectual energy is coming to the fore, and entrepreneurs with new ideas are making their way.One example of this is at Codebase, in Edinburgh, where later today I’ll meet just some of the 100 tech firms who call the UKs largest technology incubator their home. It’s the innovative firms under this roof that are the new Scottish success stories.We want those success stories to have maximum impact here in Scotland. That’s why we have updated the devolution settlement to give the Scottish Government freedom to make its own tax and spending decisions. Soon, half the Scottish Government’s budget will be determined by receipts raised in Scotland, which means local people can reap the rewards of their hard work.            The UK government is committed to Scotland by giving it the vital ingredient for success: freedom.We are also giving cities more freedom. Since 2014, we have committed more than £1 billion towards Scotland’s City Deals, giving communities the resources they need to kick-start growth and regeneration and create high-skilled jobs in cutting-edge industries like robotics. While in Scotland I’ll be announcing the Moray Growth Deal, the next step in meeting our aspiration that 100 per cent of Scotland is covered by a deal. This will give local councils and businesses the chance to submit plans to government on their priorities for boosting economic growth and productivity.We are unleashing enterprise by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent in 2010 to 19 per cent today. With greater ability to invest in new equipment and people, businesses have flourished – there are now 61,200 more than when we came to power in 2010. Those new businesses have created wealth and new opportunities for people. Compared to 2010, there are 197,000 more people in employment – that’s more than the population of Aberdeen.            And those who are starting businesses will be able to keep more of what they earn because we raised the personal allowance, cutting taxes for 2.4 million Scottish workers.We know that we need to take bold action to make sure Scotland retains its place among the world’s elite.The way to do this is by unleashing the potential and talent that already lies waiting here.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon\u0026#8217s effort and with it seal his side\u0026#8217s playoff berth.\n\n\nAfter succumbing to a 3-0 defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting 2-0 win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts\u0026#8217 unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.\nIn stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before \u0026#8211 which saw him earn a red card \u0026#8211 Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.\n\nThe south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.\nKyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a platform to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8643425.1537542535!/image/image.jpg","title":"alliance to contest carrick by election","story":"\nCarrick\u0026#8217s by-election is to be contested next month after a candidate was nominated by the Alliance Party.\n\n                \nAlliance has selected Lauren Gray to contest the Carrickfergus Castle by-election on October 18.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Carrick woman said she was looking forward to engaging with local people over the next few weeks, adding it was an important opportunity for the people of Carrick to have their say on a number of local issues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA former journalist who has worked across East Antrim, Lauren is a local Girl Guide leader and young mum, who said she was motivated to step forward by the Alliance Party’s message of ersity and inclusivity – the kind of society she envisioned for her daughter’s generation.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“The last few years have seen a number of scandals involving the DUP and Sinn Féin, as well as the ongoing political impasse caused and exacerbated by those same two parties.

They all agreed and the family found accommodation at Glendale Bed and Breakfast in Cushendall.\n  \nAllen said: “We fell into fantastic luck in reaching the O\u0027Neill family at the Glendale Bed and Breakfast.\n  \n“Eamon and Sorcha quickly helped us find enough room for our family of 12 to spend 10 days in September under one roof. This was fantastic news for our family as we found a home base for our visit. That was just the beginning of the ways that Eamon and Sorcha went above and beyond to help our family feel at home and welcomed. \n  \n“While we did spend time enjoying the coast of Antrim, we also spent several days researching our family tree. We were quite lucky to have met up with Alan Murphy in Cushendall and he helped us with the church records to find the marriage, birth, baptism, and death records of the local church of Ireland. \n  \n“While in the church we devoured as much information as possible and found the facts about our great grandparents, and great aunts and uncles. This included finding two new Great Aunts  and a Great Uncle .\n  \n“During a separate trip to the local library we found written confirmation and the exact store fronts of our Grandmother’s father and brother along with pictures of the stores along with a picture of what appears to be our Great Grandfather sitting in his cherribanc that he would use to drive tourist in the 1930’s between Larne and Ballycastle.”\n  \nThe family also found the will of their Great Grandfather and Great Grandmother, as well as confirmation that they are from the Murphy’s of Red Bay townland, and the McFetridges that owned the stores on 6 and 8 Mill Street. \n  \n“We would have never found this information sitting behind a computer screen at our home,” Allen said.\n  \nAs well as researching their ancestry the family spent time enjoying what the area has to offer including a visit to the Giant’s Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, Dunluce Castle, Bushmills Distillery.\n  \nThey also enjoyed two separate horseback riding excursions with Shean’s Horse Farm including rides on the beach and through castle ruins, Cutting Edge Helicopter rides, Predator Sea Tours and a visit to Glenarm Castle, Ballygalley Castle and Belfast. \n  \nThe Murphy family said the community of Cushendall was “as welcoming as you will ever find anywhere in the world”.\n  \nAllen added: “Each night our family would \u0027invade\u0027 one of the Cushendall restaurants for a meal, a pub for a refreshing beverage, or one of the local stores. At every stop we were always greeted with friendly people and great conversation.\n  \n“On our last night our newly adopted Auntie Mary  took the two youngest brothers on a personal tour of Cushendall that included confirming the location of the Murphy family homestead, the location of our Great Uncle’s petrol station just outside of town, the Layde church ruins, a few back roads in the area, the house of the famous painter from Cushendall , and a few houses of her own family. \n  \n“Mary may not have known it, but we’ve adopted her and she has become one of our favourite Aunties of the Murphy’s from Montana,” he concluded.\n  \nThe Murphy family were helped in their search by Alan Murphy of Cushendall Church of Ireland who gave assistance with church records and Donnell O’Loan of Antrim Glens Tourism.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/paisley-jnr.jpg","title":"65435  ","story":"    \nLAST week North

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8634725.1537953824!/image/image.jpg","title":"gall bog tractor run for diabetes uk","story":"\nLocal lady, Kate Bingham, has organised a tractor run to raise awareness and funds for Diabetes UK Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nThe Gall Bog Bar in Dromara will be the starting place for the Gall Bog Tractor Run taking place this Saturday, September 29 from 1.30pm.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKate Bingham said: “I have close family members and friends, who are living day-in and day-out with diabetes and I know the work that is entailed in keeping on top of the condition.

Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But Tom Smith, who represents Donaghadee and Bangor East, defied his DUP colleagues to see the motion sent to the full council for approval.\n\nHowever, when it was raised at council last night the DUP proposed an amendment that removed plans for the lighting up of the town hall and any inidual reference to the LGBT community, instead making it a general equality motion. \n\nIts amendment was carried with 20 members voting for and 16 against, despite Mr Smith defying his party again. \n\nEighteen of the 40 councillors are DUP, but the support of one UUP, one TUV and an independent member allowed the amendment to pass. \n\nFour councillors were absent for the vote. \n\nIn advance of this week\u0027s meeting, Free Presbyterian ministers had voiced their dismay at what they called the \"offensive proposal\". \n\nIn an open letter to councillors signed on behalf of several congregations, they urged members \"to reject this discriminatory motion\". \n\nLast month there was controversy when DUP members of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council used a procedural mechanism known as a call-in to stop the Pride flag being flown on council premises. \n\nIn June DUP leader Arlene Foster made headlines by attending a PinkNews event at Stormont, where she told the LGBT community that she looked at them \"as my neighbours or my fellow citizens\".\n\nSpeaking just after last night\u0027s vote, Mr Muir expressed his bitter disappointment that the motion fell.\n\nHe said: \"This is a real blow to all who believe true equality should not be this hard to achieve in 2018, especially after the recent words of support from Arlene Foster, which have now proven to be very hollow. \n\n\"This motion was about making a positive dference to the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people across our borough, letting them know they are accepted and valued as equal citizens. \n\n\"But instead, those who moved to quash this motion tonight have sent a negative signal that Ards and North Down Council is not dedicated to working for all.\"\n\nHis party colleague Mr Walker added: \"As the father of a gay man, I find it upsetting that some of my council colleagues have taken such a decision - essentially signalling they do not value my son\u0027s contribution to our society. \n\n\"It is completely unacceptable that anyone should be made to feel dferent, but to be made to feel so by politicians who are supposed to stand up for everyone cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\"As a council we had the power to send a strong signal, to make a change that would have brought comfort and support to so many. \n\n\"All those who voted against this tonight have made an uninformed decision.\" \n\nGreen Party councillor Rachel Woods, who backed the move, also voiced her disappointment at the DUP.\n\n\"Diversity should be celebrated. Time for some to wake up and smell the coffee,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon.

A study by the Health and Safety Executive indicated that \u0027as facial hair is grown, the protection offered by a tight-fitting mask reduces\u0027.\n\n\"As a result, a change was made in relation to officers and staff who carry out those roles. The updated policy requires that those officers and staff who may be required at short notice to wear RPE must remain clean shaven whilst on duty.\n\n\"The new policy was developed in consultation with the Police Federation and other key stakeholders.\"\n\nIn May this year, an officer from Gloucestershire was hailed as having \u0027the most hipster beard\u0027 in British police. PC Graham Smith\u0027s seven-inch facial hair turned heads during his patrol in Stroud.\n\nHe takes on the title from riot officer Peter Swinger who first achieved viral fame in 2015 when his waxed moustache and beard was spotted as he was helping to control an English Defence League rally in London.\n\nIn May, PC Smith revealed his beard was inspired by family rather than fashion.\n\n\"One side of my family are from the Orkney islands, and most of them seem to have beards in one iety or another,\" he told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"I don\u0027t consider myself to be Britain\u0027s newest hipster cop.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

moving to see firsthand the dference that \n@MarysMeals\n is making in Malawi to help young people, by providing nutritional food to 1 million children in ious communities - with generous support from people across Scotland. \n#GlobalGoalsWeek\n \n#SDG2\n \n@ScotGovID\n 🇲🇼 \npic.twitter/IG5IevNcff\n\n— Ben Macpherson MSP  \nSeptember 27, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe said: “I’ve just seen the remarkable dference Mary’s Meals is making here in Malawi, feeding more than a million children thanks to contributions from across Scotland, including from the Scottish Government.\n\n“It’s been wonderful to see the dference that a nutritious daily meal in school, provided by Mary’s Meals, is making towards helping young people in Malawi to get the best from their education and make the most of their potential.\n\n“It’s been a real privilege to see the work of Mary’s Meals, supported by iniduals and organisations across Scotland, making such a dference here in Malawi.”\n\nMr Macpherson met staff and the community volunteers who cook and serve likuni phala – vitamin-enriched maize and soya porridge – to hungry children.\n\nFor many it is their only food of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe International Development Minister stirring a pot of likuni phala \n\n\n\n\nThe minister helped serve the dish, visited classrooms and watched lessons taking place, and talked to children, volunteers and staff to find out more about the long-term impact created by Mary’s Meals.\n\nHe is in Malawi to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.\n\nMary’s Meals is to receive £1,080,000 to provide food in 27 primary and 79 early childhood development centres in Zomba, southern Malawi.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of awards to the charity from the Scottish Government, dating back to 2005.\n\nA co-operation agreement between the governments of Scotland and Malawi was signed nearly 13 years ago.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Scottish Government announced in August that it is to provide £11 million to support local projects in Malawi focused on health, education, economic development and renewable energy.\n\nEarlier this month, the charity said it is now reaching 1,361,586 impoverished children in 17 countries worldwide.\n\nDaniel Adams, executive director of Mary’s Meals UK, said: “It was wonderful to see the happy, smiling children as they arrived this morning, with their mugs in hand and ready for the day’s learning.\n\n“We’re delighted that the minister was able to join us to witness the amazing changes that are being created in the lives of so many children across Malawi and beyond.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"julian assange steps down as editor of wikileaks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

draft resolution submitted on Thursday to the EU Parliament’s civil liberties and justice committee urged Facebook to accept “a full and independent audit of its platform investigating data protection and security of personal data”.\n\nThe assembly summoned Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in May to give evidence about allegations that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica used the data of millions of Facebook users to target voters during political campaigns, including the one that brought US President Donald Trump to office.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nMark Zuckerberg faced politicians in Brussels in May \n\n\n\n\nClaude Moraes, the chairman of the EU parliamentary committee which drafted the resolution, said the probes “need to be done”.\n\n“Not only have Facebook’s policies and actions potentially jeopardised citizens’ personal data, but then they have also had an impact on electoral outcomes and on the trust citizens pose in digital solutions and platforms,” Mr Moraes said.\n\nThe committee aims to adopt the resolution, which will almost certainly be modied, by October 10 and put it to the full assembly for endorsement in late October, well ahead of EU elections next May.\n\nThe resolution also urges European justice authorities to investigate any alleged “misuse of the online political space by foreign forces”, and calls on the EU’s executive commission to propose ways to boost the powers of Europe’s public prosecutor’s office so it can tackle crimes against electoral infrastructure.\n\nIt notes “with regret” that Facebook did not send staff with the right technical knowledge to answer politicians’ questions and “points out that such an approach is detrimental to the trust European citizens have in social platforms”.\n\nMr Zuckerberg was questioned in Brussels on May 22, but the politicians used up most of the speaking time with their own remarks, leaving the Facebook chief with little time to respond.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"turkeys erdogan arrives in germany on bridgebuilding visit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

an important partner for us and it is also an important partner for Europe,” Mrs Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said.\n\n“We have a fundamental interest … in an economically and politically stable

piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Mr Erdogan said it was time to “set aside our dferences of opinion and concentrate on our joint interests”.\n\n“Turkey’s hope is to develop relations with Germany and other nations as equals on the basis of mutual respect,” he wrote.\n\nMrs Merkel championed a 2016 agreement with Turkey designed to halt the flow of refugees and migrants into Europe, which has held up even as relations between Ankara and the European Union soured.\n\nAnd Berlin considers Turkey an important partner in trying to end the conflict in neighbouring Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nPeople wait for the arrival of Turkey’s president near a hotel in Berlin \n\n\n\n\nBut there has been a series of setbacks to bilateral ties.\n\nAmong the irritants has been a 2016 German parliament resolution labelling the early 20th century killing of Armenians in Turkey as “genocide”.\n\nTurkish officials’ attempts to rally support among their citizens living in Germany last year in a referendum over whether to expand Mr Erdogan’s power caused widespread irritation, and several of their public events were cancelled – prompting the Nazi jibes from Mr Erdogan.\n\nMost damaging was the jailing of Germans amid mass arrests and firings by Turkish authorities following a July 2016 coup attempt. \n\nGermany’s foreign ministry says 35 were imprisoned on what Berlin considers political grounds. \n\nWhile the most prominent – including two journalists – have been released, five remain in Turkish custody.\n\nIn recent months, officials in both countries have sought to thaw relations – particularly on the economic front, something that has gained urgency as Turkey grapples with a currency crisis heightened by tensions with the US over the case of a detained American pastor.\n\nWhile Berlin has said the question of German aid for Turkey “does not currently arise” and emphasised the need for Turkey’s bank to be independent, it has made clear that it does not want an economic basket case on Europe’s doorstep.\n\nMr Erdogan landed in Berlin on Thursday but has the bulk of his public engagements on Friday, when he will meet Mrs Merkel and attend a state banquet hosted by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier – an event that many German opposition politicians are refusing to attend.\n\nDemonstrations against the Turkish leader are expected in both Berlin and Cologne, and Amnesty International called for Mrs Merkel to use her meetings with Mr Erdogan to address the “dramatic human rights situation in Turkey”.\n\n“In such a situation, a state visit must be used to advocate clearly for all arbitrarily and innocently imprisoned people,” the organisation said.\n\nPolice in Berlin shut down a large area around the chancellery where Mrs Merkel was to meet with Mr Erdogan, including the airspace and boat traffic on the Spree river.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"action needed defend public services

The Tory government,  now propped up by the DUP was never forced by the Troika to implement austerity - they did it voluntarily.\n\n\"But people can act to defend public services. In the south of Ireland the Right2Water movement fought to keep water in public hands. In the North. Sinn Féin Minister Conor Murphy blocked in introduction of water charges.

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods.

For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ardglass coastal clean up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA SECTION of inaccessible and rocky coastline in Ardglass was last week cleaned by volunteers with the help of local canoeists.\n\nThe clean-up \u0026mdash organised jointly by the Loch Cuain Canoe Club and the Strangford and Lecale Partnership \u0026mdash saw dozens of people show up to clean an area between the village and nearby Sheepland.\n\nCanoeists, led by local councillor Cadogan Enright, ferried the giant bags of rubbish out to waiting boats organised by the Rogers family from Portaferry who took them to Ardglass harbour.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere, they were winched up and placed in a waiting skip provided by the village\u0026rsquos harbour master, with the weekend clean-up the second such initiative to remove rubbish from inaccessible areas at the Ulster Way along the Lecale coast.\n\nLoch Cuain Canoe Club members included Joe and Gareth Fitzsimons from Ardglass, as well as Cllr Enright and his son, Cad \u0026Oacuteg, who used the occasion to highlight upcoming training courses for families wanting to get involved in canoeing locally to be held in Castleward Bay and on the Quoile River this autumn.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoAny family interested in joining in wildle or other environmental projects by canoe in the Lecale Strangford area can contact us on Facebook, said the councillor.\n\nThe weekend event attracted volunteers from the Ards peninsula as well as others from Ardglass who were joined by people from Killough, including Marty Rice and his family.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere was also a contingent from Downpatrick and Robert Hillman and Fiona Robinson from Crossgar, with the Newcastle Wild Sea Swimmers spotted collecting rubbish on shore.\n\nNewry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin thanked the volunteers for their efforts and joined them for a well earned cuppa at the harbour.\n\nCllr Enright thanked the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership\u0026rsquos Judith Caldwell for organising the day and for helping organise several other clean-ups along the Lecale Coast this year.\n\nThe coastal clean-up in Ardglass took place after 50 volunteers joined a beach clean at Tyrella the previous weekend as part of a province-wide initiative supported by volunteers and Coca-Cola employees.\n\nThe Big Beach Clean initiative involved a number of beaches including Tyrella, with Jodie McAneaney, the \u0026lsquoLive Here Love Here\u0026rsquo manager at Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, thanking all those who took part.\n\nShe said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important we educate people on protecting our marine le and our coastline it\u0026rsquos such a crucial part of our environment and also our heritage in Northern Ireland.

Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ulster Rugby players are on the ball at Can’t Cook Won’t Cook charity event  ","story":"\t\t\t\nSOMETHING was cooking in the kitchen of Daisy Lodge in Newcastle with three of Ulster Rugby\u0026rsquos best.\n\nCaptain Rory Best and team-mates Jacob Stockdale and Louis Ludik visited the centre which gives children with cancer and their families a welcome short break.\n\nThe players took part in a \u0026lsquoCan\u0026rsquot Cook Won\u0026rsquot Cook\u0026rsquo demonstration last Wednesday at the Cancer Fund for Children\u0026rsquos therapeutic short break facility.\n\nCelebrity chef Paula McIntyre hosted the event which raised over \u0026pound2,200 to help provide practical, financial and emotional support to children diagnosed with cancer and children who have a parent diagnosed with cancer.\n\nJoan Burden, Cancer Fund for Children\u0026rsquos Hospitality Manager, said: \u0026ldquoThe players were great craic and really took to the challenge, tackling courses including carbonara, T-bone steak with pepper sauce and an intricate apple and meringue desert.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

a boiler on the lucrative non-domestic RHI scheme \u0026#8211 because he said it also sometimes heats an agricultural shed in which he stores a tractor and fixes machinery.\n\n                \nStephen Brimstone, who left his £92,000-a-year job as a special advisor  to the first minister just weeks before BBC Spotlight’s December 2016 exposé about the RHI scandal, yesterday appeared before Sir Patrick Coghlin’s public inquiry to answer questions about his personal arrangements.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone before the RHI Inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe told the inquiry that he had a domestic biomass boiler which was installed in 2007 to heat his new home, and for which he got a £3,000 government grant, but that just eight years later it was becoming costly to maintain.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt was then removed and replaced with a larger biomass boiler on the non-domestic RHI scheme – which provided a far more generous rate of subsidy than the domestic RHI scheme aimed at householders– in the summer of 2015, as the scheme was spiralling out of control.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMr Brimstone installed the boiler in a shed which was used as a garage for vehicles, temporary accommodation for a few sheep, and which he said was an agricultural building – a description accepted by the inspector who set the rates for his house.\n\nCounsel for the inquiry Joseph Aiken said that from the inquiry’s investigations it appeared that what Mr Brimstone had done was within the letter of the RHI regulations  as implemented by Mrs Foster’s department.\n\nHowever, he said the case showed how the legislation was poorly worded, allowing a situation which was unlikely to have been intended.\n\nMr Aiken acknowledged that Mr Brimstone was not running his boiler around the clock, using it on average for four hours a day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

second day giving evidence to a public inquiry into a botched green energy scheme.\n\n                \nThe RHI inquiry is probing why costs for Northern Ireland’s Renewable Heat Incentive scheme spiralled. The RHI scheme was aimed at encouraging the use of green energy.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone at the RHI Inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe RHI inquiry is also looking into allegations that some DUP spads attempted to delay the introduction of cost control measures in 2015.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone served as a spad to DUP ministers in several Northern Ireland governments departments from 2008 to 2015. He successfully applied to the RHI scheme in 2015.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe inquiry heard that in May 2016 the government regulator for gas and electricity markets  received an anonymous complaint about Mr Brimstone’s RHI installation.\n\nIt claimed it was fraudulent because it was under the non-domestic section of the scheme, but should have been under the less lucrative domestic section.\n\nOfgem suspended Mr Brimstone’s payments under the scheme and carried out an audit of his installation.\n\nA query was raised, but Ofgem eventually found no compliance issues and restored Mr Brimstone’s payments\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA second complaint about Mr Brimstone’s RHI installation was made in October 2016.\n\nThe inquiry heard it was made by Traditional Unionist Voice MLA Jim Allister.\n\nThe complaint was sent to the Police Service of Northern Ireland , the Northern Ireland Office, Ofgem and Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which was running the scheme.\n\nIn December 2016 Mr Brimstone was asked by the BBC’s Nolan Show about a “heated exchange” between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell over the RHI scheme.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone was present at the meeting in question, but told the BBC there had not been any heated exchange over the RHI issue.\n\nHe told the inquiry on Thursday that while there had been a heated exchange, it was about a business trip to Canada that Mr Bell had just ed from.\n\nInquiry chair Sir Patrick Coghlin put to Mr Brimstone that he was not giving a “fulsome response” to the BBC.\n\n“I didn’t feel that they needed to know about any other matters that were being discussed at that meeting,” Mr Brimstone responded.\n\n“They were asking about the RHI scheme. I do believe I answered it accurately.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPressed further, Mr Brimstone said he felt  he had said any more, it would have “opened up a whole load of other questions”.\n\nSir Patrick also queried whether Mr Brimstone’s responses were being “carefully monitored” by another DUP spad, Timothy Johnston.\n\n“You wanted to make sure that Timothy Johnston was content with your answers which were to be given to the BBC,” he said.\n\n“In making him content you were answering this question in an untransparent way, in a limited way.”\n\nMr Brimstone had applied for the non-domestic RHI scheme, which was granted because he said it was also to heat a shed as well as his home.\n\nInquiry panel member Dame Una O’Brien put it to Mr Brimstone that although this was possible under the RHI rules, was it right? And should he have raised it with the department?\n\nMr Brimstone responded: “It didn’t... my understanding of the scheme was that up until July 2015 I wasn’t aware there was a dferentiation, for example on the tarf between the GB scheme and the Northern Ireland scheme”.\n\nDame Una pointed out that he was aware there was a domestic scheme with a less generous incentive, saying: “You were very close to the centre of government, you were in a position where you could have potentially pointed this out more explicitly.”\n\nMr Brimstone paused before answering: “The intent behind the scheme was that Europe had placed particular targets on the UK government to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and Co2 emissions.\n\n“So yes, maybe I should have, but my understanding was at that point that literally this was a good scheme to really encourage people to move away, whatever the situation was, and yes they did introduce a domestic scheme... my view was I couldn’t heat my shed on the domestic scheme... that would have been ineligible.”\n\nFollowing the second complaint about Mr Brimstone’s RHI installation, another audit was carried out and he received another confirmation that he was entitled to be on the scheme.\n\nCounsel to the inquiry, Joseph Aiken asked Mr Brimstone: “Did you think that would be the end of it?”\n\nMr Brimstone responded: “ probably given up at that stage thinking whether it was the end or not”.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n

change more than 100 lives for the better since it launched a year ago.\n\n                \nThe initiative sees Mid and East Antrim Council, Department of Justice, PSNI, NIFRS and other statutory agencies, working together to help vulnerable iniduals get the right support.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe framework involves representatives from ious agencies meeting regularly to discuss iniduals who may require support and working out how those agencies work together to provide help. The idea has helped people through referrals to the right support services or the passing on of information to direct them to ways to get help.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPSNI Supt Davy Beck said: “Each agency in the hub identies vulnerable people and, with their consent, shares what relevant information they have with the other partners. This helps create a full picture of their particular circumstances. One example is of a young man living alone in a housing executive flat, suffering from mental health issues, alcohol and drug misuse. He had a close family circle, but younger men were taking advantage of him by using his property as a place to deal drugs. The Support Hub was able to help by securing him an appointment with health professionals, substance support services, as well as securing appropriate accommodation. He is now thriving as part of a volunteer group. This shows Support Hubs help deliver the right support at the right time.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMore at www.midandeastantrim.gov.uk/SupportHubs\n\n                            \n            \n

Ravenhill Road, Belfast is to start today.\n\n                \nAccording to Department for Infrastructure, the scheme on the Ravenhill Road, from its junction with North Parade to the junction with Ravensdene Park, \"will greatly improve the surface quality of the carriageway at this location\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA statement adds: \"The resurfacing scheme will be carried out in three phases over two weeks as follows:\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPhase 1 – two nights overnight road closure from 8pm to 6am on Thursday 27 and Friday 28 September 2018.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nPhase 2 – five days off peak lane closures from Monday 1 October until Friday 5 October 2018 between 9.30am and 4pm daily.\n\nPhase 3 - four nights overnight road closure from 8pm to 6am from Tuesday 9 October until Friday 12 October 2018.\"\n\nThe statement says that when a road closure is necessary, signed ersionary routes will be operational during these times as follows: Citybound – via Ormeau Road, Ormeau Embankment, Ravenhill Road Countrybound – via Ravenhill Road, Ormeau Embankment, Ormeau Road, Ravenhill Road Roundabout, Ravenhill Road.\n\n\"The dates and duration of the road closures will be dependent on the progress of the scheme and on favourable weather conditions,\" ir adds. \"In order to help ensure the safety of road users and road workers the public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and follow the signed ersionary routes\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Whilst the Department for Infrastructure has carefully planned these road works and associated traffic management arrangements to minimise the impact on the travelling public, motorists should expect some delay and allow additional time when planning their journey.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n
