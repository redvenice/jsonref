I could show you the houses of murderers,” the innocuous-looking guy with a broad Cardiff accent keeps saying, again and again. The police ignore him, rough-housing the other morning drinkers off the bench and trying to haul one of his more boisterous companions into the van. Eleven o’clock on a Friday morning, fresh off the train from London, on my way to an exhibition: could I work this little vignette into my review, of an exhibition I hadn’t yet seen? You never know what might prove useful. It is good to have a ready supply of piquant details that prove that I am both alert to the moment and have my feet in the real world.Should I ask him to show me these places? It might make a sidebar or a featurette. How often I have wanted to wander off-course into the shadowlands and margins, not so much sidetracked as led astray, to come at things more circuitously and at a tangent – but then I might arrive too late, or not at all. We critics need to stay alert to circumstance and the unexpected.I was in need of ersion before I even arrived. The previous day I had been interviewed by a young academic from another country that had left me quite out of sorts. “What is your methodology?” he had asked. “And what are your critical criteria?” Search me. I think he believed that I carry a list about with me, a paper covered with numbered categories and tick boxes, or a spreadsheet where the pluses and minuses of an artist’s oeuvre are laid bare and calculated according to unshakable principles, perhaps even by the use of logarithms. Or, even worse, that I had in my head a set of precepts, positions and even a theory, if not several, that I could trot out to order. Even not having a theory is a theoretical position, as everybody knows.Pacing to and fro in the gallery, panther-quiet as I pad across the oak flooring (or my shoes ominous on the polished concrete), other critics veer out of my path, turn from their close encounters and step aside. We knew all about social distancing even before it started. Observe me now, an indoor flâneur wandering in circles, taking off my glasses and putting them on again, ferociously staring and squinting, brow-furrowing and lip-pursing, pausing now and again to jot something in my notebook or to take a photo, backtracking and tacking across the gallery as though in a gale, or suddenly becalmed in the spotlit doldrums, the wind taken from my sails. So much for the flâneur. Now I am drifting through a long afternoon, or beached like an oarsman who has run out of water. This whole process is accompanied by sighs, sniffs and snorts of half-strangulated derision, quiet murmurings to myself and muttered curses. Next I am a stalker, appraising the work before me as if it were a mortal enemy. Never mind murderers. Never mind methodology. A ne’er-do-well on the hoof, a critic at large.We are the men in black, and the tweedy ones, the flamboyant and the mousy, the well-dressed women and worse-dressed men, clutching our catalogues and going about our nefarious business and avoiding eye contact with one another. Get up too close and some other critic might tell you what to think, or a gallery person might take the opportunity to regale you with the official line. Do not read the wall panel if you want to retain your composure, and whatever you do try not to meet the artist. They might charm you. They might infatuate you. You might hate them. They might hit you. What use is a theory then?Other beady eyes peer over a high counter set in the corner, following me as I go, noting down the seconds and minutes I spend with each exhibit, trying to work out what I’m thinking from my body language, my feints and turns. You might have seen me at it. Occasionally I hurl myself to the floor, to get a weirder view, and I have been known to go about on all fours, to get up close to some floor-bound scatter piece, like a child with their toys, or to slump with my back to a wall, taking in the longer perspectives, or fling myself on to a bench, where I drape myself, deep in thought. Disappearing through the curtain into a video booth, hours might pass until I re-emerge, wild-haired and gawping, or refreshed after a nice lie-down. Some artworks encourage a narcoleptic view.After all that hard looking, and a period of reflection and a quick parsing of the gallery press release, there comes a point when we are at last obliged to deliver what is often touted as “the verdict”. The weight of history heavy on my shoulders and reluctantly donning the critic’s black cap, I finally take up my pen and deliver my judgment. Although I have done it in Costa and Starbucks, at pub tables and in gallery cafes and hotel bedrooms, this last bit is best conducted in camera, from the safety and seclusion of my own office. You never know when anger might assert itself, or umbrage be taken. There might be words, or worse. Even going about my business in the gallery has occasionally led to threats to my person, so when the time comes and the thing is still fresh in everyone’s mind, I like to keep a low profile when my review comes out.We have almost forgotten – how could we – perhaps the most onerous task of all: the conferring of the stars. Sometimes I wonder if we need to go through that rigmarole of writing at all, with all its quibbling ambivalences, and just leave it to the stars. One star for don’t-even-go-there. Two is pretty terrible and three might signify run-of-the-mill mediocrity or an implicit, schoolmasterly “could do better”. This is where friends and enemies, as well as careers, are made and lost, where the partisan acolytes of the artist, as well as their dealers, collectors and curators are either vindicated or infuriated. This is where knives are sharpened, stealthy assignations organised, where bones are arranged to be broken. There’s a bloke in Cardiff who might introduce you to the right people for the job.Fallible mortals that we all are, most artists cannot expect to get more than four stars. Five stars means unmissable, or that I have somehow gone giddy under the influence of it all, where I am ravished, moved even to tears of joy, and where method and criteria fly out of the window. My reaction invents itself as I go. In other words, I make shit up, winging it, and cobble something together in whatever time I have left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/608f28de3d5c1a8695e12d22a1465732b24cc0b0/0_257_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ec0f87ea6d317c1397bdc6d5b4122e4","title":"matt eich photographer life under lockdown child","story":"Photographer Matt Eich talked to his youngest daughter, Meira, about being quarantined in Charlottesville, Virginia.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008-09 the Bank consistently over-estimated the pace at which the economy would bounce back and productivity would recover.This time it thinks things are different. One of the problems during the financial crisis was that the damage caused to the banking system impeded the flow of credit to firms and reduced productivity-enhancing investment. Today, the banks are in far better shape and in a position to help businesses through short-term cashflow problems caused by the lockdown.Indeed, one of the key messages from the Bank to the high street lenders was that they stand to lose more by not lending than they will by lending freely, because there will be more long-term scarring of the economy, more companies going bust and more losses for them to swallow. At his press conference, the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was ramming home this point to lenders at at every opportunity.One of the two main definitions of recession in the UK is at least two quarters of negative economic growth. Judged by this\u0026nbspyardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were\u0026nbspsix consecutive quarters of negative growth.\u0026nbspThe United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research\u0027s business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.The NBER defines recession as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales.That said, the Bank is still working on the assumption that there is a V-shaped pattern to the economy, albeit with the downward part of the V taking six months and the upward part taking 18 months. Some voluntary social distancing will continue even after formal government curbs have been removed, it suspects.The Bank was at pains to point out that it has produced an illustrative scenario rather than a forecast, and that’s a reasonable point. Forecasting is tough at the best of times: in the current circumstances – where there is uncertainty about how fast restrictions will be lifted, how consumers will behave, and whether there will be a second wave of infection – it is all but impossible.All that can really be said is that the risks to the Bank’s scenario are skewed heavily to the downside. Threadneedle Street decided against providing more stimulus at this week’s meeting, but it is only a question of time.In the event that the pandemic does return, Bailey said the Bank would find new tools from somewhere. That might sound a bit like Mr Micawber saying “something will turn up” but broadly sums up current thinking: this is bad, but somehow or other we will get through it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8abce76720acc09b82f89962060b269b9018e5f/0_162_4890_2937/master/4890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e85febf5835bc1f38081084bbc06d4bb","title":"british airways owner reports big loss coronavirus","story":"IAG boss warns global passenger demand will not recover from Covid-19 shock until 2023British Airways owner International Airlines Group made a £1.5bn loss in the first three months of the year, as chief executive Willie Walsh said it would take three years for passenger demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels.Walsh will stay on as chief executive of IAG until 24 September, the airlines group announced, having previously agreed to delay his retirement to help steer it through the Covid-19 crisis. He had been due to retire in March.Losses after tax at IAG surged to €1.68bn (£1.47bn) during the first quarter, compared with a profit of €70m in 2019, it told the stock market on Thursday. That loss included a €1.3bn charge as fuel and currency hedges became worthless.The group confirmed it has been among firms who accessed the UK coronavirus corporate finance facility, a government-backed scheme to help large companies borrow money cheaply. It has also received a £900m loan from the Spanish government and has extended its bank borrowing.The loss will be “significantly worse” during the current quarter, IAG added. It is not planning for a “meaningful return” of passengers until July at the earliest, carrying only half the passengers it initially planned this year.IAG’s cash and other readily available funds stood at €10bn at the end of April, giving it a strong buffer. However, the airline group is still seeking to make swingeing job cuts and savings, including about 900 at Irish flag-carrier Aer Lingus as well as the 12,000 at BA.Willie Walsh, who will retire in September, after delaying his planned exit in March to oversee the crisis response, said: “The operating result up to the end of February was in line with a year ago. However, March’s performance was severely affected by government travel restrictions due to the rapid spread of Covid-19 which significantly impacted demand. Most of the loss made in the quarter occurred in the last two weeks of March.He added: “We do not expect passenger demand to recover to the level of 2019 before 2023 at the earliest.”Walsh’s retirement had already been announced in January but he agreed to delay the transition as the extent of the chaos caused by the pandemic became clear. The Iberia chief executive, Luis Gallego, will take over from Walsh.Antonio Vázquez, IAG’s chairman, said: “We are grateful that Willie delayed his retirement at this challenging time providing the airlines’ management with the necessary stability to focus on the immediate response to the crisis. We look forward to working closely with Luis in his new role.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9579a2c1eda7743b440503ee0b44c9eee677b138/0_73_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce46b21b21fa40ed4331ccf183102afa","title":"bt suspends dividend to free up 5g broadband investment coronavirus","story":"Firm unclear as to exact cost of coronavirus pandemic but now faces challenge from O2-Virgin Media mergerBT has scrapped its idend for the first time in more than a decade to free up billions to invest in building 5G and next generation full-fibre broadband across the UK.The company said profits has been partly impacted because of a £95m charge due to Covid-19, “mainly reflecting increased debtor provisions”.“Of course, Covid-19 is affecting our business,” said Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT. “But the full impact will only become clearer as the economic consequences unfold over the next 12 months.”The company said it has suspended the £1bn final idend for last year and the estimated £1.5bn in idends for the coming financial year to the end of March 2021. When the idend is re-introduced in 2022 it will be at half the previous annual amount, another £750m saving for BT. The company last moved to cut or suspend its idend during the financial crisis in 2008-09.Jansen said the money would form part of a £12bn investment to accelerate the process of getting “gold standard” full-fibre broadband to 20m UK homes by the mid- to late 2020s. BT had previously pledged to reach 15m homes on that timescale.Jansen also unveiled a new five-year modernisation plan for the business, resulting in £2bn a year in savings, which will include cuts to its 100,000 global workforce.“BT needs to be leaner, simpler and more agile,” he said. “This initiative will re-engineer old and out of date processes, rationalise products, reduce re-work and switch off many legacy services. But in five years time will we end out with less people in BT, definitely.”He added that the company has completed a three-year, £1.6bn cost-savings plan, which included 13,000 job losses and selling BT’s London headquarters, a year ahead of schedule.The company has experienced a surge in broadband and mobile use during the coronavirus lockdown and said that its networks are “performing well, and comfortably within capacity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8792bf448a028bbe3608e361b87e01c0ba63e37e/0_149_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee99b4cf38ac1557da0cc8f4b8035b92","title":"next to create new chain of upmarket beauty halls","story":"Retailer swooping on stores vacated by struggling firms to create The Beauty Hall from NextNext is swooping on stores vacated by struggling retailers to create a new chain of upmarket beauty halls in large shopping centres.Next chief executive Simon Wolfson said on Thursday that the retailer intended to “create a new force in beauty retailing” as it confirmed plans to lease the beauty hall floors of five axed Debenhams stores in malls owned by the property firm Hammerson.Next said the space would be used to launch new brand The Beauty Hall from Next with a small number of additional sites also under discussion. The retailer already sells hundreds of makeup, perfume and skincare brands, including Estee Lauder, Clinique and Emporio Armani on its own website. Its specialist beauty site Fabled – which it bought from Ocado last year – also has access to premium brands such as Bobbi Brown, Lancôme and Nars.Wolfson said the planned beauty halls would bring “our online business to life through premium store environments in some of the UK’s most important retail locations”. The aim is to open them as soon as possible, once Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted.Debenhams, which is in administration, yesterday confirmed the closures which included its stores in the Oracle shopping centre in Reading and Birmingham’s Bullring and Grand Central. Next has signed flexible leases on their beauty hall floors as well as the others stores closing in Glasgow’s Silverburn mall and Highcross in Leicester. The Debenhams closures affected 1,000 jobs and Next said it was likely that it would be able to offer jobs to some of the affected staff.The deal is also some good news for Hammerson, which like other shopping centre owners, has been hard hit by the government diktat to close non-essential shops. In April it revealed that its rent takings had fallen by two-thirds and yesterday said its £400m deal to sell seven retail parks to the private equity firm Orion had also collapsed.Hammerson chief executive, David Atkins, said the Next deal showed how former department stores could be given a fresh lease of life: “This is a really challenging time for all of us, so it’s really encouraging to see strong, innovative brands like Next work with us to plan for the future. The Beauty Hall from Next is a great concept and it’s a real vote of confidence in our flagship destinations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe195cd3bef7e5497b7dd0be02a2974be1a55f2/0_30_3882_2331/master/3882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c533ab2d59e9744627be30886e59bf3d","title":"virgin media and o2 owners confirm 31bn mega merger in uk","story":"Tie-up between parent groups Liberty Global and Telefonica aim to take on BT and Sky The owners of Virgin Media and O2 have confirmed a £31bn merger to create a new “national champion” to challenge BT and Sky in the UK.Liberty Global, which owns the UK’s largest cable company Virgin, and Telefonica, which owns Britain’s biggest mobile operator O2, are to be merged in a new 50-50 joint venture.The new company, which will challenge BT and Sky by offering consumers competitive bundles of TV, mobile and broadband packages, will have 46 million customers and £11bn in revenue.Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, said it was only ever “a matter of time” until there would be more convergence in the highly competitive UK media and telecoms market.“BT and EE together are a powerful combination in our minds,” he said, referring to BT’s £12.5bn deal to buy the mobile company in 2016. “Our rationale was that it was just a matter of time, convergence has been slower in this market. With Virgin Media and O2 together the future of convergence is here today.”The new company will invest £10bn in areas including gigabit-speed broadband and 5G networks.“The UK is one of the most attractive markets on Earth,” said José María Alvarez-Pallete, chief executive of Telefonica. “Even considering Brexit we have been investing heavily in the UK. It is the right time to commit to the future of the UK by building this value proposition.”Under the deal, which is expected to complete in the middle of next year, there is an option to perhaps float the venture on the UK stock market in three years.“We are both coming to the joint venture with the expectation we will remain partners,” Alvarez-Pallete said. “We don’t come into this with the expectation that we will turn right or left at a certain point of time. If a listing were to come down the road it can provide a transparency of value and give people the chance to own part of a national champion.”Philip Jansen, the chief executive of BT, said the emergence of a new power player in the UK market would not make BT speed up its own investment plans.The new joint venture will be overseen by an eight-strong board of directors, four each from Liberty Global and Telefonica, with the chairman rotating every two years between the two companies. Liberty Global’s Fries will be the first chairman.The deal will include recapitalisations which will see Telefonica receive £5.7bn in proceeds, and Liberty Global £1.4bn.

The rest agreed downside risks “might necessitate further monetary policy action.”Bailey, who earlier pledged “total and unwavering commitment” to safeguard the economy during the coronavirus crisis, told reporters that the fact no action was taken this time doesn’t rule out a response soon.“It’s about what is the appropriate response and what information, news, we think we’re going to get in the quite near future,” he said. “It would be slightly overstating it to say that there’s a bunch of us will never do any more and a couple of people who will.”Trade unions are urging the UK government not to make the economic downturn worse by turning off its furlough scheme too quickly.The TUC says that today’s statistics showing that two-thirds of firms have tapped the Jobs Retention scheme shows it is vital.UK banks have approved an additional 8,550 government-backed business loans worth £1.4bn within the past week, but are still struggling to increase the pace of approvals amid rising demand.The original coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) has now lent around £5.5bn to 33,812 small and medium sized businesses since the programme was launched on 23 March. The figures, released by bank lobby group UK Finance, still do not provide any insight on the proportion of applications that have been rejected, versus those that are still just being processed.

While most of the attention has been focused – quite rightly – on the medical emergency, the economy has collapsed.Almost every part of the economy – outside food and drink and the public sector – has been affected. Factories have been mothballed estate agents have stopped selling houses bars, restaurants and hotels have closed footfall in high streets has dwindled to a trickle schools and universities have been emptied.The quarantining of the population has also affected every region of the UK.

In the early 1980s it was manufacturing in the early 1990s it was housing and in 2008 it was the financial sector. This time it is everything at once, which is why the current slump is, by some distance, the most severe in recent history.To the extent that there is any good news, it is that the worst is now over. The tentative evidence from traffic congestion and job listings suggests that the economy hit the foot of the cliff in the middle of last month. April truly was the cruellest month.That said, there is little sign that the economy is going to bounce back rapidly. Most people can notice that there is a bit more going on: a few more cars on the streets a construction site that has reopened a bar doing off sales. But there is going to be no snapback of the sort that some were predicting back in March.The risk of a second wave of infection means that the lockdown restrictions will only be lifted gradually, and that process will prove too slow for hundreds of thousands of businesses that are burning through their cash and will go bust within a few months.Some of the biggest sectors of the economy – hospitality, retail, transport and travel among them – are going to be affected for a long time to come. It is hard to see how social distancing is going to be compatible with a visit to one of the tightly packed theatres in London’s West End or attendance at a Premier League football match.What’s more, consumer behaviour is bound to be affected by the lockdown. The government has spent the past couple of months warning people of the dangers of leaving their homes and it is going to be a while before they can be persuaded it is safe to have a meal in a restaurant, even if the tables are kept two metres apart. A snapback in the economy would require consumers to blow all the cash they have been unable to spend for the past two months, and that seems improbable.As the dole queues inevitably start to lengthen, even those fortunate enough to have escaped a cut in wages will get anxious. They will save more and spend less for fear that they could soon lose their jobs as well.All of which means that the government needs to act with extreme care. One of the lessons of the last recession was that austerity measures were imposed too quickly and recovery was choked off, and the stakes are much higher this time. Whether or not there is a second wave of infections there is certainly the risk of a second wave of acute economic distress starting in the autumn. The psychological impact of Covid-19 on consumer behaviour meant it was never realistic for the UK to have a V-shaped recession. The aim now is to avoid a great depression.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb280a9dc8c37a5849d9098d50ae0e5a44df6920/0_47_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beea4df18828534c28d1e39f6df33665","title":"students lockdown affected final year university coronavirus","story":"Classes, exams, celebrations and even graduation ceremonies have all been upended by coronavirus.

She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past. This kestrel seemed to be owning the space here, but in the last few days the jackdaws have moved in and the kestrel has reluctantly moved two metres upstairs into another box. They live with physical distancing as the norm. It works. I’ll hold onto that thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be851ce4871f8f7a75129cc6b46dffde8d5a5a6/0_127_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04496ce039599a66fbc4eccf016037c9","title":"nuclear regulatory commission radioactive waste","story":"Nuclear Regulatory Commission keen to allow material to be disposed of by ‘land burial’ – with potentially damaging effectsThe federal agency providing oversight of the commercial nuclear sector is attempting to push through a rule change critics say could allow dangerous amounts of radioactive material to be disposed of in places like municipal landfills, with potentially serious consequences to human health and the environment.“This would be the most massive deregulation of radioactive waste in American history,” said Dan Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a nuclear industry watchdog non-profit, about a proposal that would permit “very low-level” radioactive waste to be disposed of by “land burial”.Currently, low-level radioactive waste is primarily disposed of in highly regulated sites in Texas, Washington, South Carolina and Utah. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) also provides exemptions allowing “low-level waste” to be dumped in unlicensed disposal sites, but these exemptions are given only rarely, and are conducted with strict case-by-case protocols in place.The proposed “interpretive” rule change relaxes the rules surrounding how radioactive materials would be disposed of in unlicensed disposal sites “significantly”, said Hirsch.“If you dump radioactive waste in places that aren’t designed to deal with it, it comes back to haunt you. It’s in the air you breathe, the food that you eat, the water you drink,” he added.In an email, David McIntyre, an NRC spokesperson, explained that the rule would apply only to a “small subset” of very low-level waste, and that the agency would not allow such disposals “if we felt public health and safety and the environment would not be protected”.But major sticking point, say experts, concerns how the term “very low-level waste” is not defined by statute or in the NRC’s own regulations.The NRC describes low-level wastes as contaminated materials like clothing, tools, and medical equipment. According to McIntyre, the radioactivity of “very low-level waste” is just above background. “The radioactivity level of very low-level waste is so low that it may be safely disposed of in hazardous or municipal solid waste landfills,” he wrote.Nevertheless, “background doesn’t mean it’s safe,” said Diane D’Arrigo, radioactive waste project director for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, who added that the interpretive rule’s loose language “opens the floodgates” for nuclear waste to be disposed of “as if not radioactive.”The proposal caps the maximum annual “cumulative dose” to a person from the radioactive wastes dumped into unlicensed sites to 25 millirems – the same limit the NRC uses for highly regulated waste disposal sites. That measurement, said D’Arrigo, is a “projected” amount that can be manipulated through modeling.Experts point out that the nuclear industry has long sought cheaper ways to dispose of its wastes. As the nation’s fleet of nuclear power plants continues to age, and as more of them approach retirement, some of the decommissioning funds set up to safely dismantle the reactors are proving inadequate.“The NRC regulations are in effect a cost-benefit analysis,” explained Rodney Ewing, a professor of nuclear security at Stanford University. “It’s been a common trend to look for waste streams that, if separated out, they could be disposed of in less expensive ways.”Some environmentalists fear the rule change will also disproportionately impact low-income, marginalized communities who are more likely than their wealthier neighbors to be situated near solid waste landfills.According to Caroline Reiser, nuclear energy legal fellow with the Natural Resources Defense Council, if the proposal is successfully passed, then the issue could end up in court.“Once it starts getting implemented, that’s when the real fights end up happening,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/468bc2ca70a5f06b1ca3853f57abbe419f5e6cb1/64_31_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b14abf4163bbaf3df6a8042198d92e4c","title":"in search of greatness review sport documentary","story":"Gabe Polsky’s documentary asks whether the modern obsession with stats is extinguishing something immeasurableThis rather slight documentary on talent and genius in sport is chatty and anecdotal, but could perhaps have been boiled down further to a crisp hour-long documentary for television. There is, however, something worthwhile here, as film-maker Gabe Polsky unfashionably hits back against the “moneyball” theory of sports and its obsession with stats, performance levels and athletic targets. It takes as its cue a strange institution: the NFL Scouting Combine, a weirdly Soviet-style annual showcase in which specially chosen college football players are invited to perform various punishing tests of running and bench-pressing while boffins mull over the resulting numbers and decide on a draft pick and salary.But is all that – and the competitive fanaticism in schools – taking the joy and artistry out of sport, as well crushing the seed of genius? Sports journalist David Epstein says we are in danger of “making something important because it is measurable, not measuring it because it’s important”. Sporting heroes including football’s Pelé, ice hockey’s Wayne Gretzky and the NFL’s Jerry Rice smilingly tell the same story: they worked hard and practised incessantly, but they were also encouraged to cultivate their intuitive inspirational spark and were not put through the formally rigid programme that today’s athletes must endure.Educationalist Sir Ken Robinson is also interviewed and, as ever, he is the voice of sweet reason. To be fair, the stat fiends and the moneyballers could shrug and say they are doing this because it gets results. I should have liked to see an interview with Michael Lewis, the author of Moneyball, the non-fiction classic which popularised the whole idea. It’s food for thought, though."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f8ee513be6a967d3616f8667965ffdd40f4389/0_209_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ea458476fc117f570da5ac75cd04149","title":"more beautiful for having been broken review worst film ever contender","story":"A big-city FBI agent retreats to the country in this bizarre, monumentally inept erotic thriller featuring a risible plot and jaw-droppingly bad actingIn 2003, self-financed LA movie director Tommy Wiseau stunned audiences with his film The Room: a legendary cult jawdropper, whose making was immortalised in James Franco’s film The Disaster Artist. Many have asked whether there can ever be another to rival that?More Beautiful for Having Been Broken is utterly bizarre. It’s like a daytime soap on Xanax, written, directed and acted in a kind of stilted near-coma – part emotional issue drama, part erotic gay drama-thriller. That title is a reference to the Japanese term kintsukuroi, the art of repairing broken pottery and appreciating repaired pottery – like treasuring people for their human flaws.A big-city FBI agent called McKenzie (Zoe Ventoura) has had to take some leave after a job went violently wrong (a fuzzy flashback hints coyly and incompletely at what happened) and so takes a restorative trip to a little country town. Here McKenzie meets some of the sweet, honest down-home folk, including a woman the offscreen narrator sonorously describes as “an anti-feminist feminist, who believed that women could be insanely powerful but still be full of grace and beauty”. (In which case, that should be “pro-feminist feminist”. Or you could just go ahead and say “feminist”.)McKenzie meets Samantha (Kayla Radomski), a dance teacher and single mother of a disabled boy. McKenzie and Samantha have an intense connection, and their eventual sex is rendered as an excruciatingly tasteful fantasy dance sequence. But – wouldn’t you just know it? – one of the other women in town happens to be a former member of Congress with whom McKenzie also had a drunken fling, back in the day! Their recognition of each other is the cue for the most flabbergastingly wooden acting I have ever seen on any screen of any size.The pious bumper-sticker philosophies and crashing tonal mismatches are spectacular. “Mistakes are like birthday candles – the more you blow out, the wiser you become,” drones the narrator. And McKenzie’s hatchet-faced FBI superior intones: “Grief is a scraggy bitch, and she doesn’t give a royal fuck about your best intentions.” So true.• More Beautiful for Having Been Broken is available on digital platforms from 8 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/930075e05e2eb16f3bab9f0e05ec937c29af0972/372_43_3909_2345/master/3909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b63cb42586d901322e161837b9ceb01e","title":"sundance film festival coronavirus incubator","story":"The Hollywood Reporter says numerous attendees returned from the late-January festival with coronavirus symptomsA new report suggests that January’s Sundance film festival, the annual gathering of cinephiles in Park City, Utah, may have been a key early hub for coronavirus in the US. The article, in the Hollywood Reporter, cites numerous attendees who experienced Covid-19-like symptoms either during or immediately after the festival. None were believed to have been tested for the disease.Sundance this year attracted about 120,000 people to the small mountain resort, to watch films and party in confined spaces. The snowy conditions that make Park City perfect for skiing mean that socialising indoors is common, as are some flu-like symptoms as a result of the low temperature and high altitude.Yet this year’s “Sundance plague” appears to have been more virulent for regular attendees than earlier iterations, with many complaining of considerable difficulties breathing, multiple trips to hospital and at least a fortnight bedbound.The Hollywood Reporter cites – but declines to name – one major actor who apparently became “gravely ill” after the festival, as did members of his entourage. They quote the Black List founder Franklin Leonard saying he became sick on 28 January, when he flew home to LA. Shortly after, he says, “I was barely functional … as sick as I’ve ever been for two weeks.” Leonard reports that at least two others he knew of cut their festival trip short due to illness.A spokesperson for the Sundance festival said: “We’re sorry to hear that any of our festival attendees were unwell either during or after our January edition. We are not aware of any confirmed festival-connected cases of Covid-19.”The article’s thesis has been defended by festival-goers on social media who have been sharing their own stories of post-Sundance illness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfe14319e97d65a7f65ad14fd5285a87320a048/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0cd6adc0c7e7d93c0b8185bc0f6c3a3","title":"windowflick berlin screenings in pictures","story":"The Windowflicks project is hosting film screenings in Berlin’s courtyards, as cinemas are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

One thing they all have in common, however, is a glorious pink colour just the thing to cheer you up in these uncertain times.300g beetroot (see step 1)1 small onion1 small carrot1 stick celery1 small leek50g butter2 whole allspice berries½ bay leaf1.5 litres gelatinous beef stock (see step 4), or chicken or vegetable stock2 medium potatoes, preferably waxy (eg, charlotte or maris peer)½ small cabbage, shredded4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp cider vinegar1 tsp sugar½ tsp ground black pepperSalt|Soured cream and fresh dill, to serve (preferably Polish soured cream, which has a richer flavour)Borscht is best made with raw beetroot, but if you have only the ready-cooked sort, you can use that instead, though it doesn’t give the finished soup such a vibrant hue or intense flavour. Whichever you use, you’ll need either gloves, or a stout nailbrush, and an apron, because beetroot stains everything it touches.Peel the onion and carrot, and wash the celery and leek thoroughly. Thinly slice the onion. If using raw beetroot, peel it and cut roughly three-quarters of it into small dice, setting the remainder aside for now if using cooked, dice and set aside for now. Cut the carrot and celery into smallish dice and thinly slice the leek.Melt the butter in a large pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the onion until fairly soft and translucent. Add the carrot, leek, celery, raw diced beetroot (if using), allspice berries and bay leaf, and stir to coat in the melted butter. Cook for 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry.On the subject of stock, borscht is most commonly made with beef stock, preferably the good, gelatinous sort, which will give the soup real richness and body. However, if you don’t eat beef, chicken or vegetable stocks will also be delicious if using the latter, I’d recommend soaking some dried mushrooms in it first to give it more flavour.Meanwhile, wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into small dice. Add them and all the stock to the pan, bring the whole lot to a merry simmer, then turn the heat down to medium low and leave the soup to bubble away gently for 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.Wash and finely shred the cabbage (you can use any sort you like, or indeed kale or similar I like to use a white cabbage for its satisfyingly robust texture), peel and crush the garlic, and coarsely grate the remaining raw beetroot, if using. Stir all these vegetables into the pan and cook until everything is tender, particularly the potatoes, which should take about another 10 minutes.Once the vegetables are done, add the diced cooked beetroot, if you’ve gone down that route, just to warm through, then taste and season with the vinegar (cider is preferable, but just about anything will do, or you could use lemon juice if you prefer), sugar, pepper and a good pinch of salt, and taste again: if you think it needs any more of the above, add them gradually until you’re happy with the flavour. And if you prefer a smoother soup, blend it at this stage, too.Divide the soup between bowls and serve with a dollop of soured cream and a sprig of dill, with some dark bread on the side for dunking. Note that, if the weather permits, you can also serve borscht cold it’s nicer well chilled than just left to cool. Sometimes the soured cream (or thick yoghurt) is stirred in rather than served on top.To make this into a more substantial meal, you can add more substantial garnishes such as chopped hard-boiled eggs, spring onions, radishes, cucumber, all of which work particularly well with cold borscht for hot versions, go for hunks of sausage, cured pork or shredded meat such as chicken or slow-cooked beef. Vegetarians may be interested to know that cooked white or broad beans are fairly common additions, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/921ecce90f9245413ff7a305110f16d83d905144/120_0_2403_1443/master/2403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3890301c5640d98ee69fc83ea18e2cfd","title":"magnificent holiday meals nine dishes to transport you instantly from moules marinieres to jambalaya","story":"During lockdown, readers have been recreating food that takes them back to happy travel memories and delicious voyages of discoveryAfter a gruelling six-hour journey from Penang to Krabi in an overcrowded minivan, my then-boyfriend and I stopped off at Mr Krabi, a restaurant run by a Jamiroquai-loving Italian gentleman and his Thai wife. For my first meal in Thailand, I ordered krapow gai, and it was the perfect antidote to the trauma of the trip. The bird’s eye chillies combined with succulent chicken mince and holy basil and topped off with a fried egg were heavenly. I fell in love with the dish there and then, and vowed to learn to make it as soon as I got home. The dish reminds me of the trip, the exhaustion and stress of the journey to get to it, but also of the pure comfort it gave me when I ate it.I recreated the dish soon after my return when I asked my close friend (who is half Thai) if she had a go-to recipe for this, which she did. The recipe itself is very straightforward. I can even dictate it from memory to my boyfriend in the kitchen while I lie on the sofa nursing a hangover (which this dish always helps me get through). The hardest part about making it is finding holy basil. The Asian supermarkets rarely stock it and it’s much easier to get your hands on Thai basil, which is sweeter. Normal supermarket basil is a more acceptable substitute.I was in a bar in Bilbao a few summers ago. As soon as a tray of these arrived, they disappeared, and when we asked for some more, we were put on a waiting list. We had three helpings, and never found them on offer anywhere else, so just went back to the same bar every day for our fix.My Spanish evening-class tutor came from Bilbao and gave me the recipe. To recreate it, we cooked the mussels, chopped them with onions, garlic and white sauce, put the mix back in the half shells, then topped them with breadcrumbs and deep-fried them for a minute or so. It was easy and although it had a different texture from the originals, it was very tasty nonetheless.I’d always wanted to go to Athens, but, unlike with other city breaks, I wanted to visit for longer, as I didn’t want to be rushed. So I decided to find a voluntary project to teach English to refugees.At a taverna on the beach, I had my first taste of gemista. I was famished, and, alongside a fellow volunteer, tucked into the most satisfying meal. I close my eyes and am transported back just thinking about it.I made it several weeks ago in lockdown. There is lots to prepare, and I was apprehensive because I have never cooked rice in the oven. But it was delicious. I sent a photo of my version to a friend in Kos and he said it looked perfect. I have promised to make gemista for him when I can travel to see him.On our honeymoon, my wife and I had landed in Pisa after a delayed flight. We made our way to Florence and spotted this dish being served in the central train station. It was presented as a peasant dish, with strips of fried or roasted polenta, served with spinach, white beans, tomatoes and olive oil. I was delighted to find a vegetarian dish so easily in the heart of Italy.I have never seen it in a cafe or restaurant since, and don’t know what it is called. I have made it many times at home, for meals and parties the ingredients are easy to come by.I make it by cooking the polenta and allowing it to cool and set. I cut it into strips, wider and a little longer than a modern polenta chip. I roast these in a sprinkle of olive oil, along with some tomatoes, onions, garlic and some salt and pepper. At the end, I will mix in the beans – whatever we have … cannellini, butter, pinto or borlotti.A few years ago, I went on a tour of Jordan. My host family prepared this dish for me and I fell in love with the mix of lamb, yoghurt, rice and spices. It is a very rich dish, always prepared for weddings and other ceremonies. It is so famous in Jordan that you can easily find T-shirts that say: “I Survived Mansaf”.Unfortunately, I haven’t made it during lockdown as most of the ingredients are not available in the area where I am isolating. But I have prepared tons of homemade hummus, which also reminds me of my trip to the Middle East. Upon arrival in Bogotá, Colombia, in December 2016, my travel companion and I went in search of an ajiaco. We were not disappointed. We knew right away that we wanted to recreate the hearty stew of chicken, potatoes and corn.Our friends were teaching in Bogotá at the time and gave us a gift of the herb guascas when we left. Apparently it is not really an ajiaco without guascas or papa criolla (Andean potatoes).We first made it back in the UK in early January 2017. The very first obstacle was the lack of Andean potatoes. I’m sure lots of Colombians would disagree, but it can be made using a variety of potatoes available in your area. One of the things that makes this dish fun – and delicious – are the bits that you add to it. Topped with capers and a swirl of cream, avocado on the side – and cold beer. It is on the menu tomorrow night – when the avocado will have ripened – and we can’t wait.I had eaten the dish at the fabulous brasserie Aux Arms de Bruxelles, and when we got back I just simply had to taste it again. It took a few attempts to get the sauce right, as the mussels held too much salty water, but I played around and finally got the consistency and flavour just right. This dish speaks to me of friendship, laughter, beautiful memories and dear friends. On a recent trip to Brussels just before lockdown, we ate at the same restaurant, and they sat us at the same table as we had sat at several years earlier on our first visit. I have made this dish on a number of occasions, but the best was probably one long hot summer when I lived alone in a cottage in a village outside Cambridge. I cooked it over charcoal, in a genuine tagine pot I had picked up for a song in a local market in Marrakech. I had eaten this dish in a remote cabin, which an old bus had stopped at while crossing the Atlas mountains. Just there, high on a mountain pass, with the smells of tagines cooking, and snowmelt streams running by, it tasted amazing. I am no stranger to cooking, and had studied carefully how tagines were being cooked in Morocco, so it was not difficult to make.I first made it after coming home from an amazing trip to the deep south. One of the best things about seeing new places is discovering the food and how that connects to the wider history of where you are. New Orleans has an amazing story where a cocktail of different cultures combined to create not only jazz but an incredible culinary history. Jambalaya is very similar in many ways to paella, but spicier, with the addition of creole spices. I make paella a lot, especially on holiday, so it was pretty easy to adapt it to make jambalaya. My secret tip is to make a shellfish stock using chicken stock as a base to really pump up the depth of flavour when you cook the rice. I try to break up the lockdown week by cooking more holiday-inspired dishes on the weekend. Whether that’s a chicken laksa soup or some smoked Memphis-style ribs on the barbecue. Jambalaya is a Friday night special alongside some chilli-infused grapefruit margaritas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d259f30866419179d03a501e7a666d1537e4ec/0_285_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a107fa39e73a3805e0a3958d040d8ff","title":"football coronavirus this could be the end of grassroots game change non league","story":"In the latest in our series on how Covid-19 will change football, we look at its impact at grassroots and non-league levelThis could be the end of grassroots football. The impact is going to be horrendous. The main problem now is we’re not getting money we would usually receive from training-session fees or fundraising, because they’re not taking place. That money goes towards subsidising teams for the next season, helping them with pitch fees, league fees, trophy presentations, etc.It isn’t coming in and, when football does resume, a lot of parents will be out of work. We were subsidising a lot of kids before this happened. The club I’m involved in are partners in a 3G hub and, even with discount, it costs us over £30,000 a year in pitch hire. That’s just training for 300 kids. You’ve got league fees and council pitch fees on top. Where’s the money going to come from for fees and equipment? The firms who usually sponsor teams are getting battered too.More pitches will be sold by councils to fund rescue packages. There will be a knock-on effect on kids’ health in terms of rising obesity levels and psychological consequences. We will probably see a decrease in volunteers, who are vital in running grassroots football. We’re not in this game to produce the next Premier League star we do it to help kids get fit and make friends. But if even the Premier League are crying out for money there’s going to be nothing left for us at the bottom.Kenny Saunders, founder of the Save Grassroots Football campaignI know football will change because I’m experiencing it at first hand. In mid-March I was furloughed by Maidenhead United and my contract expires in the next couple of months. Normally I would be confident of getting it sorted out but, with suggestions we might not start playing until January, it is a little bit worrying. Football provides most of my income and you find yourself asking questions: what state will clubs be in financially when football is back? Will they all be able to carry on? And if they are, what kind of contract are you going to be offered? It may well be one with less money and at this level that can be significant.For a number of players there is not a big difference between what they can earn as a full-time player or a part-timer with another job, or working full-time in a different industry. People will be faced with difficult choices if they are offered contracts that might not represent full-time money.A lot of teams stay overnight before away games and that is a cost many won’t be able to sustain. As someone whose club tends to travel on the day, meaning I leave home at 6.30am for games up north, I know the strain that puts on a player.I don’t want to be hearing about transfer stories linking Premier League clubs with big-money signings. So many players and clubs are struggling and they need to be the focus.Expenditure on players will have to fall because of the amount of revenue clubs will lose. That goes for all levels, including ours. You would be shocked by some of the wages at tier two of the National league.There are players on £1,000 per week. We were top of the National League South from the third week of the season until its early termination in April but we are not the biggest spenders. There have been cases where we offered a player £500 per week and someone came in with £800 per week and a signing-on fee. That sort of expenditure has become even more difficult to sustain.Sensible management will be even more important. One of the things we did incredibly well was get the right player for the right money and who wanted to be at Wealdstone for the right reasons. We were specific about the type of player we wanted: local men who maybe had not had the sort of success they should have had in previous seasons and were looking to build again.I have seen suggestions the National League should be regionalised to reduce travel costs and, while understanding the sentiment, I believe good management will enable clubs to cope with a few long trips. We expect to find out this week how this season’s standings will be determined – in other words, whether we will be promoted or the campaign voided. On the basis of our cost analysis, we are confident we could handle the travel expenses – so long as people are allowed to attend matches and, with suitable social distancing, use our bar. It would be welcome if the crisis led to big clubs deciding to go on fewer world tours and contesting more pre-season friendlies with local sides. A summer game against a Premier League or Championship team – with 2-3,000 at £15 per head – can make a huge difference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b665c1077e6139982fa3ad3a56747f97d1dd84c2/29_53_2494_1496/master/2494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3de6138e33b58abd8f0cbca300bcfb","title":"footballers names players real digital regens quiz","story":"Do these brilliantly monikered players exist in the real world or are they digital creations on Football Manager?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84724b45cd57eff234457242bf191b4ec4da50c5/970_447_4598_2759/master/4598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349f82a03f6d2f0e9a904c776d566f9f","title":"nemanja matic interview instagram manchester united chelsea benfica","story":"The midfielder sat down for an online Q\u0026ampA for charity and charted his journey from a Serbian village to Manchester United, via Benfica and José MourinhoNemanja Matic could be forgiven for feeling frustrated. Manchester United’s unbeaten run has stalled at 11 games after a resurgence largely featuring his presence in midfield. . He lists United’s last league game – the 2-0 derby win against City – as a highlight of his Old Trafford career.“I cannot say I didn’t enjoy this month at home,” he says via video link. “Normally when we’re playing, we travel a lot. We’re away every two or three days. It’s been nice to spend time with the kids.” Off the pitch, Matic talks like he plays: measured, pragmatic and to the point.The Serbia midfielder is taking part in a live Instagram Q\u0026ampA session with Football Beyond Borders, fielding questions from young people about his storied career. Matic first met the charity’s co-director Jasper Kain at an event in Manchester with a former United teammate Chris Smalling – and found a cause close to his heart.“When I hear the kids’ stories, some of them have difficult lives,” Matic says. “That stays in my heart, because I know what they’re going through. The charity gives them the chance to find success, to make their lives easier. In my village in Serbia we were poor but I was happy. Every day we would be outside playing football. We had more freedom than kids today.”Matic grew up in Vrelo, 40 miles south-west of Belgrade. As a promising attacking midfielder he idolised Zinedine Zidane but did not have a TV at home to watch games. “I would collect newspaper clippings just to read about him, and the put the pictures up in my room.” Some of Matic’s friends still play for the local team. “They just got promoted to the fourth ision, so now they have to train harder,” he says.The virtues of hard work and perseverance are what Matic wants to get across to his young audience. “Follow your dreams. Never give up … I’ve had a lot of doubters in my career, people who didn’t believe in me.” As a teenager he was rejected by both Belgrade clubs, Red Star and Partizan. “I knew I was good enough, and one day I would prove them wrong, show them they made a mistake. And that’s exactly what I did.”Matic found his feet at the Slovakian club Kosice, earning his first move to Chelsea in 2009. He was quickly sent out on loan to Vitesse, then used as a makeweight in the club’s move for the Benfica defender David Luiz. In Portugal he was reshaped into a defensive midfielder by the coach Jorge Jesus. “He said if I listened to him and trained every day, I could be one of the best in the world. Benfica changed my life.”Matic, now 31, learned the new position, and also how to thrive at a superclub. One young fan asks if he still feels pressure.“When I was younger I felt a lot of pressure, seeing 70,000 people in the stadium. Now, if the fans sing my name, I just feel more motivation to run, to kick people … just kidding. I don’t do that on purpose.” Matic was brought back to Chelsea in 2014 by Mourinho, the manager he would later follow to United. He is asked whether the Portuguese lives up to his combative public persona. “It depends. If you win, he’s the best guy ever. But if you lose, you’re hiding from him at the training ground. But he’s an amazing coach.”Matic holds back only when discussing his surprise second departure from Stamford Bridge, where he won titles playing for Mourinho and Antonio Conte. “I was very happy at Chelsea, but I thought it was the right moment to change club. There were reasons which are hard for me to say now. I will never forget my time there, but I’m a Manchester United player now.”Matic has high praise for his manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær. “Ole is a great manager. I think he has improved a lot since he came to United, and he is different now. I’m sure he has a great future here, and he will win us trophies.”Matic has also been impressed by United’s new recruit, Bruno Fernandes. “Because I follow the Portuguese league, I knew he was good – even though he played for Sporting! But I’m very surprised he adapted so quickly to the Premier League. He brings us a lot of qualities, like the confidence he has on the pitch – he always knows what he wants to do with the ball.”Asked to name United’s best player, Matic does not hesitate. “We have a lot of young players, but they have maybe not reached their top yet, but Marcus Rashford has the ability to be one of the best players in the world in his position. He’s still improving, but he has everything to reach that top level.”Matic’s work ethic has taken him a long way. “I wake up early. I never stay up late. Get up, train, eat, sleep. Even on holiday, by the end of the week I need to train. Football is my life I take it very seriously. I’ve felt like a professional player since I was five years old. I don’t know how to be any different.”Football Beyond Borders (FBB) uses the power of football to educate and inspire young people across the UK.

This has been attributed by some Conservative MPs and commentators to the mainstream media’s sometimes aggressive questioning of the government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, arguing it is out of step with the mood of a panicked public seeking national unity during the crisis.“We never come out that well in polls, we’re never going to be up there with Mother Teresa,” says Mark Austin, an evening news presenter at Sky News, who has been vocal about the issue.“People think you are either with us or against us,” says Richard Sambrook, a former director of global news at the BBC and the director of the Centre for Journalism at Cardiff University. “People trust media less when they don’t see it supporting their point of view and instincts. You have the camp that’s saying we must rally around Boris in this moment of national crisis. And another camp saying that the government must be held to account on important questions.”A significant factor at play is in the wording of survey questions. For example, the Sky News survey simply asked the public about trust in journalists per se. A very different picture of public trust emerges when looking at specific media and organisations.Polls by YouGov, the Reuters Institute, and Survation, which asked 3,029 people, Ipsos MORI and weekly research by Ofcom, the broadcasting and media regulator, of 2,000 people, have all found that broadcasters and newspapers are widely considered to be the most trusted sources of information on the coronavirus crisis.“There simply has been no collapse in public trust in news media during the coronavirus outbreak,” YouGov concluded after examining trust levels recorded in its polls of 1,643 people from during last year’s general election up until last week.“Public service broadcasting is having a good crisis in terrible circumstances,” says Roger Mosey, former editorial director at the BBC and master of Selwyn College, Cambridge. “The factual information from the BBC, ITV and Sky has been good. Anecdotally and from what I see in public surveys people respect what is being said.”When it comes to newspapers, there is a significant ergence in perceptions of public trust. , Financial Times, the  and the Times have trust levels in some cases close to TV news broadcasters. Survation and the Reuters Institute have the  as the most trusted newspaper doing the best job of covering the pandemic. YouGov found in an examination of six months of data that public trust in what it calls these “upmarket” newspaper titles has remained completely stable.Mid-market and tabloid titles, such as the Daily Mirror, Daily Mail and the Sun have historically had much lower levels of public trust. There has been no erosion of these lower levels of trust during the coronavirus pandemic, YouGov found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9a2204be51e38d408f7639cfa5b088cd6ef68b/0_193_5837_3504/master/5837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41de3a3e61f9a0ca67b4906719210d3f","title":"how can i find a new place to live with social distancing in place","story":"My partner has moved out but my landlord insists I keep on paying the full rent although during lockdown I can’t moveI shared a flat and rental payments with my partner until March when the relationship ended and he moved out. The fully paid-up tenancy lasts until mid June and the notice period is two months, so if I don’t want it to roll over, I need to give notice now. Due to social distancing rules, I don’t know if I’ll be able to move house in June, but equally I can’t afford to keep on paying the rent by myself. I have offered the landlord a reduced monthly rate between June and August, after which I will move out if lockdown is lifted. The landlord, a multi-national corporation, is adamant that I must pay the full market rate if I stay, even though they are unlikely to find a new tenant during the pandemic. I’m faced with the prospect of having to move out while being uncertain as to how I’m going to view, sign up to and move into somewhere new with the social distancing regulations in place.There will be many couples in a similar position, especially as lockdown puts pressure on relationships. The government has urged landlords to compromise if their tenants’ financial circumstances change during the pandemic, but this is guidance only and so there is no legal obligation on landlords to agree.Shelter housing adviser Andy Parnell suggests that you pay as much as you can with or without the landlord’s agreement. “If the landlord doesn’t agree to reduce the rent or to delay payments, the tenant should keep them updated on how much they can pay, and how they plan to make up the costs in the future,” he says. “This could help persuade their landlord or letting agent to come to an agreement. And if the landlord considers eviction or takes legal steps to recover unpaid rent, the court involved may take the tenant’s efforts to resolve the situation into consideration.”You can’t be evicted in June because when a fixed-term tenancy agreement comes to an end, the tenant usually still has the right to occupy the property under a periodic rolling tenancy without signing a new rental contract, until the landlord takes legal action to end it.“The tenant can end the rolling tenancy simply by serving written notice as required by their contract,” says Parnell. “In contrast, the landlord usually has to serve written notice and then apply to court for a possession order and a bailiff warrant to evict them. Under the new coronavirus legislation, most landlords now need to give three months’ notice as a minimum and, as court proceedings have been temporarily suspended, landlords won’t be able to carry out evictions even when notices have expired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/677a99d61b32b81eb6a2afeb8d7d2b47eeea6b0b/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de515e25c7872cac1d866b1f9639249f","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s","story":"We are counting down the top No 1 singles since the UK chart began in 1952. Today the Kinks crank out one of the heaviest riffs ever and the Bee Gees conquer disco. Check back weekdays for more picksby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas,  Alexis Petridis and  Laura SnapesAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, the ’s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction – something to send you down memory lane, or to ert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.We’ll be counting this down over six weeks – for the first two weeks, we’ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we’ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.This list, and the songs’ order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn’t based on sales or longevity, it’s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We’d love to hear what you think of our choices – whether in agreement or outrage – and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we’ve reached No 1, we’ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock’n’roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn’t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock’n’roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. APBy disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop’s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre’s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LSRecorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn’t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. APIf you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken – sampled if you like – from Ramsey Lewis a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: “I am the magnificent W-O-O-O!” It still sounds fantastic. APThe pinnacle of Roy Orbison’s career as rock’s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. APIt won’t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBTAfter a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don’t answer your ex’s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She’s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBTBehind the simple, perky rock’n’roll facade – “the ultimate fairground anthem”, as writer Bob Stanley put it – there’s something disturbing about Del Shannon’s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. APHad These Boots Are Made for Walkin’ been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently orced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. APSaturday Night just pipped Gina G’s Ooh Aah … Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it’s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People’s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It’s got an immediately iconic tag (“dee dee da da da!”), plus it was the victor in one of pop’s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne’s Fog on the Tyne was having. LSThere will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he’s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBTProducer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes’ debut UK No 1 – the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army – but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing “I’m grown now” transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It’s got a classic belting “may-ee!” (that’s “me” in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn’t have Sound of the Underground – or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LSLike the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBTEvery part of Adamski’s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBTThe product of producer Joe Meek’s twin obsessions – space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself – Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It’s like nothing else, before or since. APThis will get you thinking, “I miss the old Kanye” – the rapper’s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet “rubbish” is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: “Like the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking  Don’t like his baggy jeans but I might like what’s underneath them.” The bump of will.i.am’s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBTDecades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who’s tried chancing his arm again: “I’m not that chained up little person still in love with you.” API Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher’s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song’s wild success – 11m copies sold worldwide – is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it’s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT“But I don’t look back,” Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush’s DNA outlines the tragedy). “And – it – hurts – with – ev – er – y – heart – beat,” Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LSFor someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn’t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he’s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes – in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It’s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LSThis wasn’t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven’t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap’s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBTThe pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach’s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent – this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBTIt’s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that’s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that “the revolution’s here”, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it’s really moving. APPerhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly – but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya’s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LSThe lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy – “Lotions of love flow through your hands  See visions, colours every day” – and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBTChannelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies – “Although my eyes were open  They might have just as well’ve been closed” – and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: “I was feeling kinda seasick  But the crowd called out for more.” A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBTYou can imagine an older relative calling this “a proper song” – unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White’s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight’s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBTThe softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn’t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he’s trying not to wake someone up. It’s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. APThe heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history – with one of the best riffs, too – only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBTAlmost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the “zig-a-zig-ah”, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard’s “a-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!” almost four decades prior) that it’s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop’s raison d’etre – seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes – and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LSDance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra’s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn’t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBTDance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy – Haddaway’s What Is Love and Corona’s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples – and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBTPop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they’ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LSMatching disco a Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People’s Heather Small – working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample – blows the house down, and her “let me tell you, what you do to me” is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBTIt’s testament to time’s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn’t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It’s the peak of Eminem’s storytelling skill and – in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan – profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan’s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LSA depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model’s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn’t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBTToo often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go’s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LSA fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. APJailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. APMost mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys’ debut single proper is something to look back on with pride – not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic “victory” for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner’s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: “Just bangin’ tunes and DJ sets and  Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.” LSAfter all that Ariana Grande had been through – the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement – she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop’s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande’s freedom. LS“Breaking up is so very hard to do” – this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy is arranger Ivor Raymonde just showing off, really. BBTOriginally written for Britney Spears, although it’s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that’s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop’s great come-ons. It’s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LSEric Stewart wrote I’m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn’t say “I love you” often enough – not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LSA posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer’s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBTAh, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy’s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers’ guitar and Pharrell’s conversational charm. BBTOn one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo’s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager’s head. An industrial cri de cœur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LSThe boy band – well, Gary Barlow – had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There’s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though – “Whenever I’m wrong  Just tell me the song and I’ll sing it” – so you don’t really fancy his chances. BBTYou might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell’s version of Gloria Jones’s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There’s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBTTo watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass’s earlier acid house hits, S-Express’s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound’s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London’s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage. LSIt’s hard to imagine now how strange and alien Jack Your Body sounded in 1987. Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it’s unbeatable. APA half-cover of the Beatles’ Tomorrow Never Knows but with that band’s LSD juiced up with some kind of experimental steroid, Setting Sun still sounds extreme. Lighting up that breakbeat and demonically heaving harmonium riffs are rockets and catherine wheels of wild sound, with Noel Gallagher sounding as if he’s being dragged out of sanity. BBTA new high-water mark of commercial success for British rap was set by this incandescently brilliant wave of London MCs, each given 21 seconds of time on the mic. The energy stays permanently high, but is filtered through such distinct characters: Harvey’s rave MC, Romeo’s lascivious loverman, Kaish’s jabbing boxer, Face’s bug-eyed vampire and more. BBTThe first attempt to make Suzi Quatro a star, with the light pop of Rolling Stone, fell flat: second time around, with writersproducers Chinn and Chapman in control, everything clicked. From its opening wall of drums to Quatro’s scream of “scratch out her eyes” to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection. APEveryone with even a glancing interest in pop knows Bohemian Rhapsody, which means its sheer audacity is easy to overlook. It’s a completely inexplicable, extraordinary single, a joke that got out of hand according to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a preposterous exercise in high camp with demented lyrics, that somehow still exerts a huge emotional pull. APThe charts in 1970 were rich with hymn-like songs solemnly marking the passing of the 60s – not least the Beatles’ Let It Be – but Bridge Over Troubled Water was the blockbuster take: five minutes of booming, Phil Spector-inspired white gospel with a choirboy vocal and a simple, universal message beneath the sturm und drang. APMore fool the person who thought up Rickrolling, believing chance exposure to Never Gonna Give You Up to be some kind of punishment: the Stock Aitken Waterman tea boy’s star-making moment couldn’t be less cool or more glorious, his good-boy Redcoat brogue the cheese to SAW’s soulful, acid pickle. And, hey, if it was good enough for Larry Levan … LSThe 80s began in British pop when the stately, epic Are “Friends” Electric? arrived on Top of the Pops in June 1979: two synth players, Gary Numan looking puzzled, as if he didn’t understand how a song with no chorus had become a hit. He was six months early, but Numan was always ahead of his time: oft-mocked, his alienated-suburbanite-in-a-world-of-technology schtick now seems remarkably prescient. APGaga’s third UK No 1 outshines earlier hits Just Dance and Poker Face as the apex of her tectonic, Teutonic first-phase battering rams. While it’s heavily indebted to Depeche Mode and Madonna, Gaga’s weapons-grade persona turns a homage into a conquest, tagging everything in her wake with a lusty “Gaga, ooh la la.” LSOne of the greatest Christmas No 1s of all time is a triumph of emotional candour. It resembles a breakup song with its talk of final kisses, but was written by Tony Mortimer after his brother killed himself. The pain of those sudden calls of “stay now” is so acute, voicing the suddenness of loss. BBTSoaring above Reach Out’s dramatic arrangement – which smashed through the boundaries of Motown’s signature style, inspired by the Rolling Stones’ Paint It Black, not that you’d know – lead vocalist Levi Stubbs sounds as if he’s close to tears, delivering the lyrics as if they’re a matter of life or death. It remains an astonishingly intense way to spend three minutes. APA song in which disgust at Thatcher’s Britain seems to meld with Paul Weller’s increasing unease over the mod revival he’d single-handedly started, Going Underground was also the perfect demonstration of what its author had learned studying taut, potent mid-60s pop: grab the listener from the start, don’t let your grip slacken or a second go to waste. APThere are plenty of arguments for Heart of Glass not really qualifying as the only UK No 1 punk single. While Blondie came from the genre’s first wave in New York, their 1979 hit mainlined European electronic pioneers Kraftwerk and Heart of Glass in its brilliant, cycling riff, while Debbie Harry’s rhapsodic vocals owed more to Donna Summer (whose I Feel Love the group had been covering), with a twist of downtown irony. It pissed off the punk purists back home – which is, incidentally, pretty much the most punk thing you could do by 1979. LSThe production on Merry Xmas Everybody is fuzzy as tinsel (the result of recording in an echoey corridor), potent as plum pudding doused in brandy and appropriately poignant, straddling that late-December ide between nostalgia and optimism. Which is what, it’s easy to imagine, gave it the edge over Wizzard’s dementedly cheery I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday, the loser in what’s now considered the original festive chart battle, though it cemented glam as the official sound of Christmas. LSThat opening crescendo, giving way to the Nile Rodgers-penned guitar funk riff, is one of the most breathtakingly exciting moments in Bowie’s catalogue, and the croaky croon of “put on your red shoes and dance the blues” a few seconds later is one of the coolest. Let’s Dance remains an irresistible command. BBT“We all just thought she was a groupie,” noted the Damned’s Rat Scabies of Chrissie Hynde when the Pretenders made it big, the kind of dismissive remark you suspect fuelled Brass in Pocket’s surfeit of attitude: “I’m special.” Brilliantly, it sets its narcissistic swagger to music that’s languid and sensual rather than aggressive: perfect pop ensues. APBear in mind Rod was asking this question when his hair’s volume had been turned way beyond 11, and when he was giving an audible crotch-thrust at the opening of each chorus line. And yet, even though this song is utterly ridiculous, it is also utterly brilliant – the way the synth melody steps up before pirouetting down is eternally replayable, and Rod’s charisma is, sorry, a bit sexy. BBTOn his breakthrough single, Tom Jones exhibits the kind of determined perkiness that can only accompany truly desperate heartbreak. That double negative gives his confusion away as he tries to come to terms with seeing his girl out with another guy, but it’s no use: “I wanna die.” In a Top 100 full of savagely unhappy yet upbeat songs, this is the most emotionally dissonant of all. BBT… Baby One More Time wasn’t the first hit from Denniz Pop and Max Martin’s Cheiron Studios – Backstreet Boys and Robyn predated Britney. But the Louisiana 16-year-old was to Cheiron what Kylie was to Stock Aitken Waterman: the first act with the personality to overwhelm the blueprint (Euro melodies, metal’s impact and club-pop’s sparkle) and make it her own. Rockists accuse Britney Spears of being an empty vessel, but it’s her vocal DNA that shapes every single word of this song into a pop landmark. LS“Nah pop nah style,” sang Althea and Donna, and they had a point. What’s striking about the greatest reggae No 1 of all is how unvarnished its repurposing of an old Alton Ellis it is, the lack of concession to white ears as Althea and Donna riff on the lyrics of Trinity’s Three Piece Suit with blank-eyed teenage insouciance. APOf Madonna’s 13 No 1s, Vogue is her most poised, agile and sexually intoxicating. It is a portal into a world of glamour – the litany of classic Hollywood in the middle eight, but also the world of peacocking ballroom culture it was borne from – where you find Madonna herself presiding over the decadence with her commands and observations. Get up on the dancefloor, indeed. BBTA masterpiece of synthetic production: the gorgeously wrong approximations of horns, bass guitar and piano have their own delirious beauty. But, of course, it’s Whitney who seals it. That final chorus line, “with somebody who loves me”, is so emphatic in knowing she deserves happiness, creating a paradoxically euphoric song about being lonely. BBTThe arrival of You Really Got Me amid the still relatively mild No 1s of the time must have been startling – it even makes the Beatles sound like squares. One of the all time great riffs, made from only two notes, powers the garage-band energy as the group’s lust builds to a ferocious head. BBTJust imagine this being the third song you’d ever written as a band, turning a litany of silly teenage crushes into one of the all-time great ballads (and home to the most arresting sax solo since Gerry Rafferty’s Baker Street). It wasn’t Wham!’s third single – George Michael astutely parcelled it out later, asserting his soulful, songwriterly bona fides after a raft of more cartoonish hits, and paving the way for a different shade of solo career. LSSneering attitude and glowering negativity – provoked by everything from radio DJs to TV advertising to a lady declining to have sex with Mick Jagger because she’s on her period – aligned to the most famous guitar riff in history. Satisfaction is pissed off, provocative, dirty, thrilling everything great about the mid-60s Rolling Stones condensed into 3 minutes and 45 seconds. APFortysomething years on, the opprobrium occasioned by the late-70s Bee Gees seems utterly baffling: the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack sounds like a masterclass in pop songwriting, as evidenced by Night Fever’s perfect evocation of pre-club anticipation: “On the waves of the air  There is dancing out there … We can steal it.” APWritten by Motown brains trust Holland-Dozier-Holland, Band of Gold sees Payne sitting in a lonely bedroom, her wedding night gone disastrously unconsummated after some kind of freak-out by the groom. Although the exact details are tactfully veiled by Payne, it’s an unforgettably specific scenario, its horror hammered into your mind with that unyielding snare rhythm and told via a wondrous vocal line. BBTJimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond had already written a book on how to have a No 1 record, The Manual, after their novelty chart-topper Doctorin’ the Tardis. As the KLF, they brought every one of their tricks to bear on this titanic piece of rave: hip-house rapping, gospel choirs, chants about an ancient race of people and a huge synthetic guitar riff. What on earth was it on about? The mystery was the final key to its success. BBTOstensibly the first disco No 1 and the product of songwriters Harry Casey and Richard Finch observing what worked on the dancefloors of Miami’s clubs, in truth, Rock Your Baby carved out a shimmering, supple musical space entirely of its own: organ-led, Hi Records-esque Memphis soul, complete with imploring falsetto vocal, over the hissy ticking of a primitive drum machine. APAny of T Rex’s magisterial run of No 1 singles could be in this list, but Get It On just shades it, by dint of being the most imperious sounding of the lot: the earthy R\u0026ampB of Chuck Berry recast into a defiantly modern shape, sexually charged in a way no teen pop had previously been.

She pulled off the not-inconsiderable feat of emerging from a TV talent show with her musical credibility intact. While still a teenager, her cover band PopLyfe reached the final of America’s Got Talent – on YouTube you can still see her belting out  We Will Rock You for the edification of Piers Morgan – but when they failed to win, she quit the band, declined an offer from the show’s host Nick Cannon to join a rap group he was assembling and rescued herself from a life of penury by releasing her own mixtape.Offering R\u0026ampB that was pop-facing but lyrically tough, 2014’s Cloud 19 and its successor You Should Be Here snared her a major record deal, and from that point things appeared to go according to plan, at least commercially: guest spots with Eminem, Zayn Malik, Charlie Puth and Justin Bieber, a gold-selling debut album, a succession of platinum-selling singles. But there were also high-profile relationships, equally high-profile accusations of infidelity, questions about her mental health, a suicide attempt and an accusation from the ever-delightful Chris Brown that this was a sympathy ploy, and a three-month partnership with controversial rapper YG that ended when a video of him apparently cheating on her appeared on a gossip website (he denied it). All of it has played out, a little queasily, in the full glare of social media, Instagram shots from hospital beds and all.There’s an argument that none of this has done Kehlani’s profile any harm. Certainly, she’s not above playing on the public’s prurient interest in her private life, as when she released a collaboration with YG, Konclusions, on Valentine’s Day, followed three days later by a solo track called Valentine’s Day (Shameful) that addressed the end of their relationship in no uncertain terms: “I hope you fuck around and have the son you wanted with the bitch.” Either way, concerns about her public image hang over her second album from its title down.Its centrepiece is Everybody Business, an acoustic guitar-driven track that interpolates Pharrell Williams’s Frontin’ in order to protest against her reputation at length: “I can’t be fazed by what you mistake as going insane … I hear every word they talk and try not to care at all.” Elsewhere, while there’s nothing as explicitly personal as You Know Wassup, the single she released a fortnight after YG’s unscheduled appearance on the gossip sites, there’s still plenty of rumour-stoking stuff about make-up sex, getting back with people you know you shouldn’t, attempting to change the ways of bad boys and what one website calls “the fraught aspects of a toxic relationship”, which is one way of describing the lyrics of opener Toxic: “Surfing on your face while you eat that … you know that dick has always been problematic.”This is all good, pot-stirring fun but it would be a shame if it drowned out the music. It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is an album so concise and focused that songs regularly clock in just a shade over two minutes, and which offers a succession of 21st-century reboots of the old-fashioned R\u0026ampB slow jam. Everything proceeds at pretty much the same pace – languorous crawl to the bedroom – but there’s enough variety on offer to ensure it never sounds monotonous. Its trick is to hitch the viscid beats and Parrish’s multi-tracked vocals – more indebted to mainstream 90s R\u0026ampB than the neo-soul artists she is compared to – to unexpected sounds and samples: a backdrop of muted electronic groans and bright sax improvisation on Hate the Club, a burst of vocals that sound like Gregorian chant put through AutoTune on Bad News, streaks of echoing guitar and off-key time-stretched voices on Can I.It’s liberally sprinkled with subtle, clever sonic touches, not least on Serial Lover, an assertion of Parrish’s pansexuality (“I’ve got bodies I want to take to the grave, I’ve got girls I want to give my last name”) that starts out straightforwardly enough, with a No Scrubs-ish combination of acoustic guitar and stammering rhythm track, before twisting unexpectedly. The hook is fantastic, underpinned by a beat that seems to slip slightly out of time behind Parrish’s voice to such disorientating effect, and you find yourself hitting the rewind button to hear it again. Walking with impressive confidence along the line that separates commercialism from experimentation, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t doesn’t need an accompanying soap opera to sell it, but it’s got one anyway.Bright Light Bright Light feat. Jake Shears – SensationBecause, in what the TV ads keep referring to as “these difficult times”, what you sometimes need is neon pop that provokes a disco in your kitchen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return.So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets.For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed.Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court.It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus. What part of a death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible.From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans?Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up. That he was essentially a prime minister for the Good Times, someone to lift spirits with delusional appeals to jingoism. All of which could take place in a moral vacuum of no consequences for him. Now, though, he knows he’s been found out. That his failures have left him with blood on his hands that no amount of washing for 20 seconds while singing Happy Birthday can get clean. He has become Lady Macbeth.Whatever the truth, Boris could not prevent himself from sleepwalking into further incriminating himself. It was an outrage, he said, that NHS staff did not have adequate PPE. As if the situation was in no way his responsibility. Bluster had given way to dissociation. In his head he is both the prime minister and not the prime minister. Schrödinger’s PM.Thereafter, his logic collapsed in on itself. Having promised 250,000 tests back in March, he now promised to double the health secretary’s still largely fictitious figure of 100,000 to 200,000 by the end of the month. Matt Hancock shook his head in disbelief at this. This was clearly the first he had heard of this. Here was yet another ad hoc commitment on which he would be hung out to dry.Boris concluded by saying he was sorry not to be able to announce what measures he may or may not be introducing to ease the lockdown to parliament this week. Mainly because he still hadn’t a clue what they might be. Kill the economy or kill the nation? Maybe he would have more data by the time he spoke to the nation on Sunday. Or maybe he wouldn’t.But he did promise someone from the government would make a statement to parliament some time next week.

But compliance was much higher than the government had anticipated.Now the Conservative election supremo, Isaac Levido, has been helping to draw up the communications plan for “phase two” of the crisis, as Johnson has called it.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that allowing people to spend more time outdoors in “small, defined groups” was one of the five “initial options” Scotland is likely to pursue when the scientific evidence justifies lifting some constraints.Scientific evidence suggesting transmission of the virus is less likely in open spaces has led ministers to focus on allowing more outdoor activities. However, pub beer gardens and coffee shops with outdoor seating are likely to remain closed, as are most shops, amid fears that it would be difficult for them to enforce social distancing.Meanwhile the continued high number of new Covid-19 cases – 6,111 on Tuesday – is likely to deter ministers from more radical steps.Since the lockdown began six weeks ago, the public have been urged only to leave their homes to buy essentials such as food or medicine to exercise once a day or to go to work if they cannot do so from home.The restriction on exercise has seen police officers accused of overreach, for moving on lone sunbathers or scolding members of the public for taking a rest on a park bench.The government has been urging local authorities to keep parks open where possible, and confirmed that businesses such as DIY stores and garden centres can operate click-and-collect services, where goods can be picked up while observing social distancing.Significant changes in schools are also expected, with teachers and unions expecting that Johnson will on Sunday confirm the 1 June start date for schools to reopen, beginning with children aged 10 and 11 in year six.Other primary year groups are expected to follow shortly after, and then for years 10 and 12 – the first years for GCSE and A-level courses respectively – to also return to secondary schools.The decision means that pupils in England could return months before those in Scotland, after Nicola Sturgeon warned that Scottish schools may be shut until the end of the summer holidays. Scotland’s school year ends on 24 June, three weeks before England.Questions remain about how schools in England will be expected to source personal protective equipment, especially for staff in reception classes where children as young as four require close attention.In a joint letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, the National Education Union and Parentkind – formerly the Parent-Teachers’ Association UK – warned “there is a risk of chaos and a greater spread of the virus” unless parents and staff were reassured about the safety of reopening.Other measures still under consideration include the creation of social “bubbles”, allowing households to mix with a limited number of others. Downing Street has not ruled out this option – though some ministers are sceptical about how it could be enforced in practice.One Whitehall source warned that if people failed to stick to the rules carefully, it could lead to “a catastrophic epidemiological demonstration of the rule of six degrees of separation”.Ministers are also keen to get more people back to work where it is impractical for them to work from home, though draft guidelines for safe working have prompted a furious backlash from unions this week.None of the changes announced on Sunday are likely to affect those with underlying health conditions, who have been asked to “shield” themselves from the virus by continuing to remain permanently at home.The relatively modest shift is likely to infuriate Conservative MPs who have criticised the impingement on the public’s liberties and the economic costs of the lockdown.Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, has called for the lifting of “arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible” and suggested the public had been “a little too willing to stay at home”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e988347fcbf42ba26feb50dbc19c0d91b0b46d38/0_60_4799_2880/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5933a133382c4d95844d2def936bc960","title":"finnish basic income pilot improved wellbeing study finds coronavirus","story":"First major study of scheme comes as economic toll of coronavirus prompts fresh interest in ideaEurope’s first national, government-backed basic income experiment did not do much to encourage recipients into work but did improve their mental wellbeing, confidence and life satisfaction, according to the first big study of a Finnish scheme that has attracted fresh interest in the coronavirus outbreak.“The basic income recipients were more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain than the control group,” the study, by researchers at Helsinki University, concluded. “They also had a more positive perception of their economic welfare.”The study comes as the devastating economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis - including soaring unemployment worldwide - sparks renewed interest in basic income schemes. The pope suggested in his Easter address that “this may be the time to consider a universal basic wage”.The Spanish government said last month it aimed to roll out a basic income “as soon as possible” to about a million of the country’s poorest households, with the economic affairs minister, Nadia Calviño, saying the Socialist-led government hoped a universal basic income would become “a permanent instrument”.Finland’s two-year scheme, which ran in 2017 and 2018 and attracted widespread international interest, paid 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people across the country a regular monthly income of €560 (£490), with no obligation to seek a job and no reduction in their payment if they accepted one.Aimed primarily at seeing whether a guaranteed income might encourage people to take up often low-paid or temporary work without fear of losing benefits, the scheme was not strictly speaking a universal basic income trial because the recipients came from a restricted group and the payments were not enough to live on.But it was watched closely by other governments who see a basic income not only as a way to get more people into some form of work, but also as a route to reducing dependence on the state and cutting welfare costs. The idea has gained traction amid predictions that automation could threaten up to a third of current jobs.The researchers, who conducted 81 in-depth interviews with participants in the scheme, concluded that while there was significant ersity in their experiences, they were generally more satisfied with their lives and experienced less mental strain, depression, sadness and loneliness than the control group.The researchers also noted a mild positive effect on employment, particularly in certain categories, such as families with children, adding that participants also tended to score better on other measures of wellbeing, including greater feelings of autonomy, financial security, and confidence in the future.“Some people said the basic income had zero effect on their productivity, as there were still no jobs in the area they were trained for,” said Prof Helena Blomberg-Kroll, who led the study. “But others said that with the basic income they were prepared to take low-paying jobs they would otherwise have avoided.“Some said the basic income allowed them to go back to the life they had before they became unemployed, while others said it gave them the power to say no to low-paid insecure jobs, and thus increased their sense of autonomy.”The scheme also gave some participants “the possibility to try and live their dreams”, Blomberg-Kroll said. “Freelancers and artists and entrepreneurs had more positive views on the effects of the basic income, which some felt had created opportunities for them to start businesses.”It also encouraged some participants to get more involved in society, by undertaking voluntary work, for example. “Some found the guaranteed income increased the possibility for them to do things like providing informal care for their family or their neighbours,” said one of the researchers, Christian Kroll.“The security of the basic income allowed them to do more meaningful things, as they felt it legitimised this kind of care work. Many of the people who performed such unpaid activities during the two-year period referred to it as work.”Kroll said the results of the study could support arguments both for and against basic income. “But as we’ve all learned in the early part of 2020, insecurity is not a good way to live,” he said.“While basic income can’t solve all our health and societal problems, there is certainly a discussion to be had that it could be part of the solution in times of economic hardship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7625d4e04b59e787842332d3e77e9f6ed8ddd088/13_0_2532_1520/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67a0b011c0deb89360821b6afdd47a12","title":"colin o brady antarctica solo trek south pole","story":"Colin O’Brady took on the elements, a relentless rival and weeks of isolation as he walked solo and unassisted across the southernmost continentHaving trekked hundreds of miles into Antarctica in late 2018, American Colin O’Brady reached a memorable landmark: the south pole. It was only a waypoint on the way to O’Brady’s pursuit of a record – the first-ever unaided, unsupported solo crossing of the continent. Yet when he made it to “due south”, it was time for an impromptu celebration. He did a handstand, posing as if he was holding up Earth.“I was at the south pole, the bottom of the world,” O’Brady tells the . “It was a moment of riding high. My emotions were on top of me … I’m thankful I let myself experience that positive moment.”Things weren’t always so lighthearted as O’Brady navigated his way through sub-zero temperatures and whiteouts while engaged in a head-to-head competition with Britain’s Louis Rudd. Now O’Brady shares his story in a new book, The Impossible First: From Fire to Ice – Crossing Antarctica Alone.O’Brady recalls his journey of 932 miles over 54 days. He also discusses his previous experiences setting speed records for the Seven Summits – cresting the highest point on all seven continents – as well as for the Explorers Grand Slam, which includes reaching those peaks as well as traversing the final mile to the north and south poles. He reflects on a time when such achievements seemed impossible – an accident in Thailand left his legs burned, after which he needed to learn to walk again, aided by his mother, Eileen.National Geographic questioned O’Brady’s record earlier this year. The article said that O’Brady used a groomed vehicle trail during the final part of his crossing. The article cited a previous solo crossing of the continent – a longer journey by Borge Ousland in 1997, in which Ousland used a sail at several points. The article asked why a sail constitutes technological assistance, while a groomed vehicle trail does not. O’Brady calls the National Geographic article “completely factually inaccurate”, adding that it contains “blatant omissions”. He has also asked the magazine to retract the article.The book contains a cast of characters including himself his wife, Jenna Besaw, who provided key support throughout the journey and his rival Rudd. And, what he sees as a non-human player: Antarctica.O’Brady recognizes that most readers will never visit the southern continent. He tried to evoke it through sensory descriptions of what he calls its “scope, grandeur, intensity, desolation”.As a child, he read about famed Antarctic explorers of the early 20th century, such as Roald Amundsen, Robert Scott and Ernest Shackleton. But it was the Explorers Grand Slam that first took O’Brady to Antarctica. He learned about unsuccessful attempts at a solo, unassisted, unsupported crossing – such as the one by Henry Worsley, which cost Worsley his life.“I just got really fascinated by Antarctica,” O’Brady says. “It was a personal challenge.”He knew from reading about previous attempts that it would takes enormous amounts of physical and mental strength. “Certainly for this one, I was curious about how it would tap into my body, mind and soul,” O’Brady says. “I would be alone in a really intense two months there.”He attempted the feat on cross country skis, dragging a 300lb sled packed with supplies including his tent, stove and provisions. Throughout the journey, Rudd was in O’Brady’s thoughts.“He’s an extraordinary man, a really accomplished polar explorer, a really accomplished British military veteran,” O’Brady says. “He was very sure of himself. He was clearly in my psyche. I was in awe of him, intimidated.”Although they shared a plane ride to Antarctica, their paths only crossed once during the actual competition, on day six. The space Rudd took up in O’Brady’s mind became obvious when he asked his wife in a phone conversation, “Is Lou real?”Ultimately, O’Brady resolved the dilemma about Rudd by deciding that his rival was “either real or not real, but a great motivator.”O’Brady says such motivation was vital, beginning on day one when he despaired of pulling his sled, and it continued to help on occasions when all seemed lost. He experienced such a moment not long after his headstand at the bottom of the world. A fearsome Antarctic wind nearly yanked away his tent off into the icy void.“Thankfully, I grabbed onto it and held on for dear life,” O’Brady says. “Antarctica is so unforgiving. You can have 40 or so good days in a row before you make one mistake. It would have been game over.”Yet the game continued and at the end, O’Brady finished two days ahead of Rudd on the Ross Ice Shelf on 26 December 2018.“We’ve continued a friendship that I’m really grateful for,” O’Brady says, adding that of seven billion people on the planet, Rudd is the only one who knows what his journey was like.Since then, O’Brady has returned to Antarctica – to set another world record last December. He was part of a six-person team in a rowboat that naviagted the Drake Passage from the southern tip of South America to Antarctica.“It’s one of the most challenging and dangerous waterways in the world,” he says. “It’s a whole other journey.”The Covid-19 pandemic has put an end to O’Brady’s adventures for the time being – he and Besaw had been scheduled for an expedition to Mount Everest. In the meantime, O’Brady is reapplying his insights on solitude gleaned from his Antarctic trek.“The lesson is that isolation can be a place where we maybe get to a deeper point of contact,” O’Brady says, “where we’re not fully disconnected from everyone.” He notes that even while alone in Antarctica, he was corresponding with students and answering their questions as part of a nonprofit that he and his wife have established.“Solitude certainly has fearful, intense moments,” says O’Brady, yet it has been part of “important pieces in my life … I hope that in the midst of the coronavirus crisis ... some people can have a moment of reflection, and hopefully something positive moving forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bbc2b81dba868b5a2f0cbdf84b88c58048a3d56/0_42_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753365d777b02f020a07adb0ae4e7bb0","title":"my favourite game derbyshire v northants 1981 natwest trophy final cricket","story":"For a sport-obsessed teenager who had a perverse obsession with Derbyshire, this nail-biting final was a chance of validationNot every childhood highlight stands the test of time. Were Curly Wurlys really that good? Or Toffos? Or Puffa Puffa Rice? It prompts a faint sense of apprehension as I start to search for my most sacred piece of sporting footage, from Saturday 5 September 1981. And breathe: as well as being awash with glorious distant summer sepia, it retains an emotional resonance like nothing before or since.The context may need a little explaining. Despite living more than three hours’ drive away, only one cricket team really mattered. Derbyshire CCC had won nothing since 1936. Not only that, there were few more downtrodden underdogs in any team game in Britain. Even now, people unfairly refer to something being “about as much fun as a wet day in Derby”.It was, admittedly, the case that Derbyshire routinely finished bottom of the County Championship in the 1970s. But tree-ringed Chesterfield was high among the country’s most scenic grounds, Bob Taylor had an irresistible pair of blue wicketkeeping gloves and my pet rabbit was named after Geoff “Dusty” Miller. It had a lucky escape, given Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan also made the shortlist.Now, finally, there was a chance of validation, both for the Peak District’s finest and my perverse obsession. Courtesy of a madcap last-ball win in the semi-final against Essex, “Derbs” had somehow made it to a sun-baked Lord’s for the NatWest Trophy final. Could they do it? With Derbyshire, it seldom paid to be too optimistic. Soon enough Northants were 99 without loss on a flat, dry pitch, only for a swiping Wayne Larkins to pick out a sun-hatted Miller in front of the Mound Stand. When Allan Lamb was narrowly run out by a direct hit from Miller and a ing Alan Hill pulled off an improbable catch in the deep to remove Richard Williams, the contest was wonderfully poised.Geoff Cook went on to make a fine 111 but, from 168 for two, Northants were pegged back to a moderate 235 for nine from 60 overs. Derbyshire, in reply, began slowly. John Wright’s autobiography, Christmas in Raratonga, is an uproarious read for connoisseurs of well-told Derbyshire anecdotes but the Kiwi was rather less flamboyant here. The good news was that the dapper Peter Kirsten was at the other end: shirt unbuttoned, chest glistening, the scoreboard ticking over nicely at 164 for one.Until both went in quick succession to ratchet up the tension significantly. Unlike rugby or football, there is more time in cricket to fear the worst. Miller swung a juicy full toss from Sarfraz Nawaz for a relieving six but Northants gamely clung on. Everything, in the end, hinged on the game’s final delivery: Jim Griffiths to Colin Tunnicliffe with one run needed to tie and earn Derbyshire victory by virtue of losing fewer wickets.From the boundary rope, it felt as if my whole life was on hold. Sport-obsessed, rural upbringings can do that to you. Up ran Griffiths and bowled to Tunnicliffe. Did it hit his pad or had he got an inside edge? No matter. Miller hurtled up the pitch from the non-striker’s end and, simultaneously, hundreds of us rushed on to the field with no idea of the outcome. Had he made it? Incredibly, a couple of Derbyshire sun-hats were flying in the air. Eureka! If you check out the dopey-looking youth jumping around in front of the Lord’s pavilion at the bottom of the screen, you can still see what teenage nirvana looks like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bdbe13a8da0d7b0fdb44ac4383decbd968d1993/55_62_1931_1160/master/1931.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=158bd125a97de523180e774ee9b7d882","title":"classic youtube best sport clips gianfranco zola giro ditalia peter ebdon collymore seles","story":"This week’s roundup also features Monica Seles, the Windies and a bust-up between Souness and Dunphy1) Gianfranco Zola at Chelsea.

In a grim situation this may represent the height of optimism it would be a bonus for the armchair fans and the TV companies, even if every banal word of encouragement from behind the stumps would be echoing eerily around an empty stadium.These plans may come to nothing but if none are made there definitely will not be any international cricket this summer. It seems the right thing to do and Steve Elworthy, a logistical expert in overseeing tournaments, is hard at work.The detail of what is required is beyond my pay grade, but the medics, the technicians, the broadcasters, the hoteliers, the groundstaff and the maintenance staff will be brainstorming to create an environment that is biosecure (a word, now commonplace, that does not exist in my dictionary).But what of the players? Assuming they are reassured that playing cricket again does not risk their health, will they be in a fit state to perform in a Test match? Without wishing to enhance any reputation as a curmudgeon the answer is: “Do me a favour. Of course they will.”It was suggested a month ago by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, that England’s players would need four weeks to be ready for a Test. Well, they may want four weeks, but they don’t need it.If the West Indies series really can begin on 8 July, both sides will struggle to prepare but it would be wildly inappropriate for them to complain. The level of the players’ fitness and form would be a pinprick compared to other considerations and in any case “the same for both sides” mantra applies. We are in extreme circumstances.Did Wally Hammond and Lindsay Hassett insist upon a delay to the start of the Victory Test series in 1945 to allow both sides to complete their physical and mental preparations? I don’t think so.The crowds flocked to those matches as a visible sign of national relief and an expression of hope that life was returning to normal. That will not be possible in 2020 and there is no victory to celebrate, but there is an appetite for some live sport even if all the seats at the grounds (presumably Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl) are empty.With safeguards satisfied and permission granted, the players are obliged to put on a show but the matches will be hard-pressed to emulate the joyous, fraternal contests between England and the Australian Services of 75 years ago (bear in mind Don Bradman was in Australia at the time).In fact the idea that the only way to prepare for an international is by playing several matches beforehand is now outmoded. Admittedly Sir Geoffrey Boycott has always been keen to point out the imperative of playing proper cricket before any Test, and before him Fred Trueman would not take much prompting to point out that he bowled 1,200 first-class overs every season. Playing cricket probably is the best way to prepare for an international match, but this has rarely been the way over the past couple of decades.Modern players are not spooked by a lack of match practice. Prince among these is surely England’s white-ball captain, Eoin Morgan of Middlesex – notionally. In 2019 he played two Championship matches for his county, which was two more than he managed in 2018, 2017 and 2016.Morgan is a national treasure after last summer’s World Cup triumph but one should also admire how he has cracked the system. He has proven that it is possible to flourish playing the odd games around the globe – his latest non-international venture was for the Delhi Bulls in the T10 Super League in Abu Dhabi – in between captaining England. He still manages to deliver at regular intervals as a batsman on the international stage. That is neat.Before the virus took hold two more unlikely characters demonstrated how it was possible to excel after being pitchforked into a Test without playing beforehand. Mark Wood played no Championship cricket for Durham last summer when he only appeared in ODI cricket for England until the World Cup final.Yet when selected for two Test matches in South Africa in January he prospered, such was the diligence and determination of his preparations. Dom Bess did not have to deal with the constant threat of injury like Wood yet when he suddenly appeared in South Africa, a novice in Test cricket, he had not played a match since the previous September. Yet he also performed remarkably well.It is easier for bowlers to survive without match practice. They can enhance their fitness and tune the appropriate muscles by bowling in the nets or on the square, which can be a solitary, lonely pursuit. With dedication and a carefully planned routine it is clearly possible to prepare effectively for a Test match in this way. Wood keeps proving that. It is even possible to do so and keep within the physical-distancing guidelines.It is tougher for batsmen it is more difficult for them to ease back into form in the middle of a Test. One mistake and they can be back in the pavilion. More than bowlers they need the rhythm of batting in a match. The magic touch has to return. But let’s not be too precious about this. The logistical challenge of playing a Test in the time of coronavirus is a massive undertaking by comparison remembering how to bat, bowl and field is a doddle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c8a16f4b31de432f1efcaa664b87339129a5fb/0_0_1180_708/master/1180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef76412003f20ffe98978df04e5262dd","title":"eight best monologues made in lockdown","story":"From love triangles to the bond between mothers and daughters, performers step into the relationships minefieldThe beady-eyed character of Iseult Golden’s monologue could be an Alan Bennett creation: steely and unsentimental, she speaks her mind smartingly in a video message to her daughter who refuses to talk to her. Her tone is spiky at first but Marion O’Dwyer’s wry, understated delivery gives the drama a quietly pained depth. Part of the Abbey theatre’s monumental series Dear Ireland, it captures the bristling complexities of love between mothers and daughters in eight bittersweet minutes.Part of a podcast series, The Lockdown Plays, this thrilling read-through reminds us that Inua Ellams is as much a poet as a playwright. Performed by Phoebe Fox, it contains the literary quality of a short story and dramatic tension of a play. A woman speaks in intense, elliptical ways about her boyfriend but directs her words to another woman. Her tone remains taut and mysterious until the final twist when this love triangle is explained.This begins like a pop video with a song played over sexy closeups of a woman’s skin, and segues into a steamy bedroom scene, narrated and performed by Danusia Samal (“She grips the top of the bed, toned arms nicely displayed”). Her character’s performance of lust stops in a piercing moment of self-knowledge and Samal interrogates the internalised male gaze with clever subversive subtlety. As playful as it seems in form, Bangers (part of the Virtual Collaborators series) leaves a disturbing aftertaste.If there is a funny side to lockdown, it can be found in Rachel De-lahay’s off-the-wall offering, filmed like an Instagram Live video and featuring a millennial organising a socially-distant R\u0026ampB singalong with her hitherto anonymous neighbours. Susan Wokoma performs embarrassed Englishness with comic aplomb and her nervous wittering distils the pain of being young, urban, alone and in need of human contact. Chosen from submissions to feature in Papatango’s Isolated But Open series, this is delightfully silly stuff.If Thursday-night clapping reminds us of NHS heroism, Aoife Martyn ests her character – a hospital nurse at the rockface of the Covid-19 pandemic – of any vestige of saintliness. Norma Sheahan’s nurse is an overworked and irascible woman who would be unlikable were it not for Sheahan’s sensational distillation of emotional exhaustion. This 10-minute film from the Dear Ireland series offers a slice of lockdown life that is chilling, humane and tragic at once.“I’m used to his hands around my neck but it’s different if you’re not in bed.” So says Marli Roode’s character in this monologue about female desire and male violence. Among the winners in the Popelei Seed Commission: Women in Lockdown, it captures the explosive mix of lust, love, jealousy and need in an abusive relationship. It has a stark but poetic quality with a strong performance by Hannah Morley.Katie Arnstein’s monologue appears to be a light, lunchtime rumination by a mother about a blanching moment, long ago, when her school careers adviser shamed her in class for having ambition. But beneath the humour lies anger around his chauvinism and, it is hinted, class prejudice. Another gem from the Popelei Seed Commission, with Laura Bayston capturing a wistful sense of derailed ambition but also a mother’s determination that her daughter will never be diminished in the same way.Zoe commandeers her flatmate’s YouTube channel for a cheeky chat. “It’s been 638 hours since I’ve had sex,” she says, and then: “I love wanking … Is wanking sex?” She proceeds to flirt, lick her fingers and ulge intimacies with joyous abandon. Part of Graeae’s Crips Without Constraints series, it comes with subtitles and there is great, uninhibited writing from Anita Kelly along with a beguiling performance from Francesca Mills. It is tender, too, beneath the eye-watering detail, about the yearning for human touch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e9a811a74a67e0907386d3fff3c4aad4dd29b87/0_282_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17e64f8c148f4fe03fa3b5f46cd546d","title":"how to conduct a remote interview seven tips for schools hiring teachers","story":"A former deputy headteacher reveals how to ace the remote recruitment process during lockdown and hire a teacher perfect for your schoolAs a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, more schools than ever are recruiting new teachers online. How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa293dee15c1e0d52ce302ce87406578fc24120a/0_64_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bff4d938f5bcd5ccaea1fdc13267d1f","title":"british tourism businesses post lockdown plans","story":"As the nation waits for details of the UK’s exit strategy, destinations are working on safe ways to manage visitors this summerIn the topsy-turvy world of lockdown, the message from the UK’s holiday hotspots this bank holiday weekend is the same as it was at Easter four weeks ago: stay away.However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. “We can’t afford to wait until lockdown’s over and find we’ve not got the plans in place,” said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. “The question is how we reset.”It’s a big question. Discussions around what to open and when are taking place against a backdrop of huge public anxiety about coming out of lockdown. An Observer poll at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it’s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious with those do flout the current rules, as happened this week in the Lake District.The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we’ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens we’ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won’t be dining in a crowded restaurant if it rains we won’t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. “Our consumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,” said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. “People can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There’s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time – that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.”But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.“The challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,” said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. “What people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.”This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. “If local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you’re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,” said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: “We had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were trying to get to islands to self-isolate. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.”At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. “You can’t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,” said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. “If tourism isn’t allowed to return – and if the value of that tourism isn’t created, a lot of businesses won’t be here this time next year.”Of course the economic impact hasn’t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on iniduals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company Under the Thatch, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August – but mainly for more expensive properties. “It’s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.”He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there’s an appetite for holidays this summer. “I’ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.” Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six Pig hotels and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: “The worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the ‘perfect storm’ of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed … This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.”The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. “We’ve spent hours talking about what we’re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,” he said. “It’s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.”Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines comes into place, but Hutson fears they’ll also make the atmosphere strained: “People come to us for the social aspect – to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That’s part of what we sell and if it doesn’t exist it’s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be ‘released’. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.” Despite Hutson’s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. “In Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,” said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. “This summer we might look more continental.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac8508561328ecb3402c430efbcc9f0f4aeb0d7/0_262_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a54b4e48cead8b7ed738a0bde43eb4","title":"my happy place readers travel tips","story":"Memories of beaches – in the UK or further afield – as well as village bars, sunrise views and days out with tea and cake are sustaining readers during lockdownA day out in Whitby. Morning tea and fruit cake with Wensleydale at Bothams. Walk to the sea, and out onto the pier. Walk up the beach, climb up the cliff and then back to the town past the whale’s jaw. Fresh crab sandwiches for lunch, then climb the 199 steps to the Priory. Back down, just enough time for afternoon tea and cake before crossing back over the river for a fish supper at the Magpie.

No TV, no internet, just the sound of the river, the cuckoo and the deer. There’s no place like it and I cannot wait to return.Paul WilsonMy happy place is Shell Bay in Dorset. I’m about eight. It’s always very warm and sunny as Dad would never make the short crossing from Sandbanks if there was any chance of cloud or rain. This place that we visited perhaps only once a year with its empty expanses of beach, backdrop of sand dunes, crystal clear sea with yachts in the distance, is magical in my memory. I also remember complaining about the long walk carrying beach paraphernalia around the headland to find a “better spot” and worrying I wouldn’t be able to find Mum and Dad again up in the dunes as I came back from the water’s edge. Oh yes and no ice cream!LizTucked away in the curve of the Pagasitic Gulf on the Greek mainland lies the port town of Volos where my husband and I lived and married 20 years ago and from where, according to myth, Jason and his Argonauts set sail. Following the coast road for 20km or so brings you to the western side of Mount Pelion and the village of Milies. Here, under the shade of an enormous plane tree, you can stare across the Aegean to the Sporades beyond and then, if it’s the weekend, take the narrow-gauge railway train called Old Sooty back down through the mountain to Volos after three too many ouzos. I visit often in my dreams. It’s a place where breathing slows. There’s nowhere like Pelion, mythical home of the centaurs, on earth.JoOur happy place is the bar in a small village, Mons La Trivalle, in Haut-Languedoc, southern France. Travelling there, through vineyards, cicadas in the background, and the Caroux mountains rearing up as we reach our destination, fills us with joy. As we enter the village there is a sharp bend and then in front of us is the bar Auberge du Caroux. There’s the table we will sit at, exchanging greetings with the owner and locals, drinking rosé or pastis, coffee on market days or lunch on Sundays, watching the world go by. • minervois-carouxTessa BucknellTranslating as Kissing Steps, this city-centre space epitomises Copenhagen’s inspired approach to urban design. It’s a deceptively simple layout of wide wooden steps leading down to the cleaned-up harbour, surrounded by containers which open into bars and a stage. In the brief summer, locals catch up with friends, sunbathe and swim in the brackish water, often straight from work. Sipping cocktails, listening to low-key DJ sets and egging each other on to jump into the harbour remains one of my favourite family holiday memories of recent years.NickArriving once more at the tiny bar at top of the walled village of Allerona, close to Orvieto, ordering the first drink and sitting at an outside rickety table is to know pure happiness. The view is down the steep village street, glorious with window box geraniums, or, to one side, through a stone archway to roll upon roll of Umbrian hills. Locals drop by to catch up over an espresso or beer – all greeting the newcomer. Few tourists make it here and, in winter, cold will permeate the stones but in my mind, arriving with endless blue skies, it’s perfection.Lin LeftleyI often revisit memories of lazy days at Da Adolfo – a mid-price beach restaurant a short hop from Positano main dock (look for the boat with the red fish sign). Da Adolfo is a local institution, its reputation earned not only for the seafood and homemade pasta but for the bubbling atmosphere. Tourists and locals sit elbow to elbow, the chatter building as more jugs of wine are consumed. Plates are passed down from the cliffside kitchen, waiters jogging barefoot over hot beach pebbles. I can think of no better way to spend an afternoon than flopping back on my lounger after a wonderful lunch, soaking up the sun and taking a dip. • daadolfoChloe BoothThe Turtle Islands, off the coast of Sierra Leone, are sublime, both scenically and culturally. A five-hour canoe ride leaves you entirely cut off from the rest of the world, and the welcoming people of the fishing villages will give you a glimpse of their daily lives. This is Nyangai, but the only guesthouse on the islands is on nearby Bakie. It was only recently opened by Isagah, who grew up there.Kevin PerryLast year for Vesak Day (the Buddhist national holiday) I finally hiked up Mount Bromo in East Java, Indonesia. The first day was spent hiking up Bromo’s crater and generally frolicking around Bromo national park’s moon-like landscape. On the second day we awoke at 2am to hike up Seruni Point, which is directly opposite Mount Bromo. After around an hour of hiking we found a spot to settle down, eat breakfast and wait for sunrise. Although we knew we had picked a good spot, it wasn’t until later that we really appreciated how lucky we were. This was the view that welcomed us when the sun came up. I doubt I will ever be anywhere again that can beat this.MelanieThe open door of a train on Indian railways... Sitting on the step and watching the landscape. Passing behind me and moving between carriages are chai sellers, food hawkers, buskers and beggars. Any train, second-class sleeper, just after sunrise or just before sunset. No prices, no website: just get yourself to India and book an overnight train somewhere.Nigel GommWho could be happier than a student, just finished year-end exams, going camping with his pals? My happy place is called Long Beach, a wide hard-packed beach on the open Pacific side of Vancouver Island. In the early 1970s, before it became part of Pacific Rim national park, you could drive on the beach and camp anywhere. It was an adventure to get there on logging roads through the mountains. The sound and sight of endless rollers coming in off the ocean, the salty breeze, the bald eagles, the camp fires and starry nights, the purity and isolation shared with friends ... although I live far away, that place will always be my spiritual home.

But last week, as people flocked to Florida’s recently reopened beaches, Daniel Uhlfelder had a message for beachgoers.“The grim reaper represents death. This is a deadly virus. It’s a global pandemic,” he said in a televised news broadcast.It’s not in Uhlfelder’s nature to want to keep beaches closed – as a lawyer, he has campaigned to keep beaches publicly accessible in the past. But as the coronavirus death toll reaches 75,000 in the US and global shutdowns help to slow the spread of the deadly virus, Uhlfelder felt he had to say something.And so, he came up with an idea to dress up with a cloak and scythe, and take a Grim Reaper tour of Florida’s beaches.The protest has garnered national attention: Uhlfelder has appeared on Saturday Night Live, the Daily Show and CNN, and has raised thousands of dollars, which he will donate to Democrats who run for Congress.But when he came up with the idea, his wife warned him not to do it. He was even told by people online not to partake in the stunt – some laughed and wished heatstroke upon him. In the end, their unkind words turned out to be pretty useful.“I thought, maybe they have a point,” he says. And so, Uhlfelder took heed of his enemies’ advice and swapped out the $20 Walmart costume he originally intended to wear and called a friend to see if she might have something better.Needless to say, the experience was not entirely pleasant. Uhlfelder says he was heckled on the beach: people took photos of him, called him a jerk and some other, more unpleasant names too.Still, Uhlfelder says the comments don’t bother him – in fact, he’s not even particularly mad at the beachgoers. Uhlfelder empathizes with people who want the economy to reopen and life to go back to normal – particularly when the president doesn’t take shutdown seriously.“We have beautiful beaches, I’d love to go to the beach – that’s why people come to Florida. We don’t have anything else,” he jokes. But he asks why the US has made the offer of staying at home so unappealing for ordinary Americans.“We are the wealthiest country on the planet. Why can’t we have people taken care of for two, three, four months, instead of being put in these situations? They are perfectly comfortable starving out or killing people,” he says.Most people have reacted positively to the stunt – and Uhlfelder says he is happy that his dry sense of humor has cut through in landscape when some of the loudest voices have been anti-shutdown protesters carrying guns. He just hopes his protest empowers others to do the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

That’s bring your own Covid-19.Health officials in Walla Walla, Washington, are admonishing the sudden rise in so-called “Covid-19 parties” where non-infected guests mingle with those who have tested positive for the virus, ostensibly in hopes of speeding up the process of catching, and overcoming, the virus.“Walla Walla County health officials are receiving reports of Covid-19 parties occurring in our community, where non-infected people mingle with an infected person in an effort to catch the virus,” the county said in a press release Tuesday.Some of those cases can be linked back to parties, Meghan DeBolt, director of the county’s Department of Community Health, told the Walla Walla Bulletin.“We don’t know when it is happening. It’s after the fact that we hear from cases. We ask about contacts, and there are 25 people because: ‘We were at a Covid party’.” She added: “It’s unacceptable. It’s irresponsible.”Washington state, hit early and hard by the coronavirus, has tallied 15,185 cases and 834 deaths that have been attributed to the coronavirus.The idea isn’t wholly original. In years past, parents have brought children to so-called Pox parties, where children are deliberately exposed to others believed to have chicken pox.Concerns of intentional self-infection have surfaced as health authorities around the world consider the concept of “immunity passports”, which could enable those who test positive for Covid-19 antibodies to travel or return to work more quickly.But DeBolt says the inherent risk of intentionally exposing anyone to infection is compounded with Covid-19, in part because scientists don’t fully understand whether someone can be reinfected by the virus.Either way, said DeBolt, those who chose to attend parties are jeopardizing public health.“It is not an innocent endeavor, by any means. It really sets us back. In reopening the county, we look at not only total case count, but if our community is being diligent” she told the Bulletin.DeBolt said she plans to enlist law enforcement to scour and stamp out any future coronavirus parties.“This will delay our community being able to reopen and get our economy operating. This is stupid … Walla Walla is better than that” said DeBolt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81574a33d843c3746842b9568b8857b64fd9e5ad/925_312_4545_2727/master/4545.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b008d3ace4a438a1d28ca982c38cbc7e","title":"we have had zero information gps in the dark over covid 19 tests","story":"Local authorities and GPs yet to receive detailed data and patient records from Deloitte testsThe results of hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests carried out at privately run drive-through centres in England have not yet been shared with GPs or local authorities, who complain they have “no idea” where local disease clusters are.GPs told the  they had been “totally left out of the conversation” after the government said it was still “working on a technical solution” to get Covid-19 test results into inidual GP records in England, having promised to do so weeks ago.Meanwhile, the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, apologised to local health leaders who have not yet received any detailed data from “pillar two” tests conducted by the private firm Deloitte over the past month. These now form the majority of tests being carried out each day, either at drive-through testing centres or via the post.Initially only patients in hospital could get tests in the UK. Then testing was expanded to NHS staff and care home staff. Now up to 10 million essential workers and their families who are showing symptoms of coronavirus can apply for a test via a government website.\u0026nbspThe list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the\u0026nbspchildren of key workers\u0026nbspto carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors.During a conference call on Wednesday with directors of public health at local authorities across England, the government’s national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, Prof John Newton, also apologised for not yet sharing the detailed data. He said there had been “data quality issues”.Newton admitted that the Deloitte tests did not yet ask people for their ethnicity or whether they worked in health or social care – an oversight described by one director of public health on the call as “really disappointing”. People of colour and healthcare workers and those working in care homes are known to have much higher incidences of the disease.When the government began its pillar two testing scheme in late March it promised GPs that results would be linked to the medical records of patients in England.But Nick Mann, a GP at the Well Street surgery in Hackney, London, is one of many doctors to complain this has not happened. “As a GP I’m absolutely fuming, not only with the way it’s been mishandled but with the unreliable information we are getting,” he said. “This government has developed a completely parallel system in order to bypass the NHS, and it’s failing.”Helen Salisbury, a GP at the Observatory Practice in Oxford, has 100 suspected cases on her list and only five with a confirmed positive test. “We have had absolutely zero information. The only way I know if a patient of mine has tested positive for Covid is if they have been ill enough to be admitted to hospital. It feels like we’ve been completely left out of the conversation, whereas most of the Covid out there is being handled by GPs,” she said.Those responsible for coordinating the coronavirus response at local authority level in England also say they have not yet received any detailed data from the Deloitte tests.Dominic Harrison, director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council in Lancashire, said: “The Deloitte screening programme has now been running for a number of weeks and we have seen no data from that. So I have no idea whether 10, 100 or 1,000 Blackburn with Darwen residents have tested positive.“I certainly hope they sort that out very very quickly because it is critical information for us in developing the strategy for case finding and contract tracing once the lockdown is lifted..”Colin Cox, director of public health in Cumbria, said he had received only headline figures from the Deloitte testing centre in Penrith, and no postcode-level data to identify any local clusters.“We’ll certainly need that level of detail once we get back to a process of contact tracing (though lots of that will be a national process not a local one). Before then, there wouldn’t be a clear policy response to knowing that. But certainly the fragmentation of the testing system has been a challenge,” he said.Greg Fell, director of public health in Sheffield, said: “If we really want to get to grips with who has tested positive and chasing down their contacts, we need this detailed data fairly rapidly, particularly when the lockdown restrictions are relaxed.”Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “We would expect GPs to receive a timely copy of a patient’s results, particularly if they are positive, so that we can provide appropriate clinical advice for patients – not just about Covid-19, but having a full picture of a patient’s health, including their medical history, will help us to deliver holistic care to them for other conditions and illnesses.”This week health ministers in Scotland complained that they had been barred from seeing thousands of coronavirus results from rapid testing sites for weeks because of data restrictions imposed by the UK government.The Department for Health and Social Care said data from the pillar two testing programme was shared daily with Public Health England, National Services Scotland and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, and would soonbe shared hourly.“We are working on a solution for local authorities to access data to support local and regional decision-making,” a spokesman said. “We are actively planning to get Covid-19 test results into inidual GP records in England. NHS Digital are leading on this, and it involves working closely with the Royal College of GPs and the British Medical Association.“This needs to be carefully done to minimise any clinical safety risks and ensure it is done accurately. We are making good progress on the technical solution for this work but it will take some time. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have their own processes relating to healthcare records.”Deloitte has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance may 7","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:African nations are facing a surge of Covid-19 cases with less than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey has found. Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the numbers it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers’ projections showed.The United Nations has warned that the global pandemic could cause “multiple famines”, as it appealed for a further $4.7bn in funding to help more than 50 vulnerable countries. The comments came as the UN appealed for a further $4.7bn (£3.8bn) in funding for its global humanitarian response plan.Coronavirus cases in India have risen past 50,000 according to the country’s health ministry, with the pace of infection showing no sign of abating.The number of people who have died after contracting Covid-19 in Europe has surpassed 150,000, with most in the UK, Italy, Spain and France, a tally of official figures by the AFP news agency showed.Mayors in many of the world’s leading cities have warned there can be no return to “business as usual” in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown.Poland has postponed Sunday’s presidential election amid the outbreak. The postal-only ballot will now take place “as soon as possible”, but is likely to not happen until at least June.A cabinet minister has confirmed that 400,000 gowns from Turkey to protect medics from coronavirus have been impounded because they were poor quality, but he insisted “strong supplies” were now coming through to the frontline. The personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey was heralded by ministers several weeks ago as “a very significant” shipment that would ease a shortage of gowns in the NHS, but the delivery turned into a shambles after it was repeatedly delayed. Now it has emerged the gowns were in fact useless for medical purposes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6935b7c15e3164e06eb9b53ef8745290d48efda9/0_104_4915_2952/master/4915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab86303559fd9f31be0e4e87613cb7d","title":"coronavirus part of new normality says german agency as briefings cease","story":"Robert Koch Institute says approach now is to ‘learn to live with the virus and control it’Germany will have to learn to live with the coronavirus, building tactics such as physical distancing and strict hygiene into normal daily life, the country’s leading public health institution has said as it wound up its regular press briefings on the pandemic as a result of a continued fall in new infections.Lars Schaade, the vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute, said that as Germany’s infection rate had been “substantially pushed back”, the decision to drop its briefing – which has attracted millions of viewers since it began in February, firstly daily and later twice weekly – marked a “new phase”.“The epidemic is of course not over,” he said. “But having substantially pushed the virus back so that the number of new cases are between 600 and 1,300 a day … our approach now has to be to learn to live with the virus and to control it.”Journalists attending the briefing strongly voiced their opposition to the briefing being scrapped. It has provided the public and media with detailed information on Germany’s infection rates, up-to-date information on the virus’s development, and explanations on preventive measures and the science behind public health decisions, free of any political colouring.Schaade said the media could continue to put questions to the institute’s press department and there would be press conferences in the event of significant developments.Germany has had 166,091 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Thursday, according to figures registered with the RKI, an increase of 1,284 since Wednesday. There were concerns that the numbers of new cases were increasing, but Schaade insisted they reflected the normal development on a weekly basis, with higher numbers often registered on Wednesdays and Thursdays.The country’s reproduction or R rate has fallen to 0.65, meaning that on average every 10 infected people are infecting between six and seven others.Schaade said he expected the pandemic to last for many more months, and most likely into next year. “It’s clear this virus cannot be eradicated in Germany. There’s consensus on that – at least until there’s a vaccine or a treatment. We will have to try to build this virus into our everyday lives, changing our behaviour to reduce its transmission. We find ourselves in a new normality.”He said tackling the virus required each person to take responsibility for his or her own behaviour. “Only then can we control the virus and lead an appropriate life as a society.” On Wednesday the leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed to put the onus on regional public health authorities to monitor the virus’s progress and instigate emergency measures if infections start to rise. If the rate of new infections in a municipality exceeds 50 per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days, communities will be swiftly forced into lockdown, including the closure of schools and shops. Schaade called the measure a “pragmatic safety limit”.There is considerable nervousness in Germany over decisions to allow all shops allowed to open and schools to return. Angela Merkel called the decision to come out of lockdown “brave”, stressing the risk that Germany could quickly lose the advantage it has gained over the spread of the virus. “We have to be careful that this thing doesn’t slip from our grasp,” she said on Wednesday.The chancellor has been accused by some political parties of acting too late to save the economy, while some virologists say the measures go too far too soon. The effects of the relaxation of rules are expected to be visible in infection rates around two to three weeks after their implementation.Schaade said testing and tracing remained essential to tackling the virus. Although Germany has maintained a capacity to carry out 964,000 tests a week, only 317,000 tests were carried out last week. Schaade said this was a reflection of the fact that the number of infections had fallen, but owing to a global shortage of items such as reagents “it is not bad to have a certain remaining capacity” in expectation of a second wave.

Now they’re enduring another challenge: a nationwide beer drought.Beer production in Mexico was halted more than a month ago as health officials declared brewing a “non-essential” activity.Since then, the country’s stockpile has dwindled, fueling a robust black market in which speculators are demanding more than twice the pre-pandemic price.“We’re not producing a single beer,” Karla Siquieiros, president of Cerverceros de México, told the newspaper el Universal.But some beer-makers have continued their operations. The country is the largest beer exporter in the world, and Constellation Brands – which produces Modelo, Corona and Pacifico in Mexico for US markets – is still brewing for export.Oxxo, Mexico’s ubiquitous corner store chain, warned in late April that its beer supply would last just 10 days, prompting panic buying and long lines outside stores.Mexicans have greeted the domestic beer shortage with more bemusement than anger. Hashtags like #LaÚltimaChela (the last beer) trended on Twitter, while users posted pictures of empty fridges.But retailers say the loss of sales is seriously harming their livelihoods in an economy that is already tough.“Mexicans like to drink beer,” said Cuauhtémoc Rivera, director the National Alliance of Small Merchants, Anpec, which represents thousands of mom-and-pop stores.“This is a big money-maker for small stores,” said Rivera.Anpec had lobbied for brewing to be declared an essential activity, arguing that it would help people cope with coronavirus lockdowns.“States of anxiety, desperation and fears that could end in episodes of irascibility and intolerance” were inevitable during quarantine, the organisation argued, adding: “The consumption of beer at home operates as relaxant, which helps with enduring a difficult trial.”Many municipalities have banned the sale of alcohol for the duration of Covid-19 quarantines. Some analysts say that such measures can help reduce domestic violence – at a time when domestic abuse under lockdown is on rise around the world.But others said such laws conform to a familiar pattern in which Mexican authorities feel the need to take action – any action – in times of crisis.“Lots of authority figures love it,” said Xavier Tello, a healthcare consultant. “The authorities can show that they’re acting like authorities by imposing dry laws … as if it solved anything.”As temperatures climb, some beer drinkers continue to hunt for Mexico’s last few beers. But it can be a frustrating pursuit.Last weekend, Johnny, an engineer in the border city of Reynosa, visited eight stores in three neighbourhoods but came away empty-handed.“There is absolutely nothing,” he said of the stores in Reynosa. “There’s liquor, but not everybody wants that. And it’s dwindling too.”He did find beer for sale on the black market, but the asking price was triple the normal.In the end, Johnny crossed the border to buy a six-pack of Corona in Texas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115eb2091681de3e4a157c77ffcaed56848303dd/0_178_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=672516e680c9e47175e5930971b06b7f","title":"us to delay hong kong report to see if china further undermines autonomy","story":"Delay comes after Beijing’s highest office in Hong Kong referred to city’s protesters as ‘virus’ that must be eradicatedThe US will delay its report on Hong Kong’s autonomy until after the Chinese government’s major annual meeting later this month, in anticipation of what actions Beijing “may be contemplating” to further undermine the independence of the semi-autonomous territory.It comes after Beijing’s highest office in Hong Kong referred to the city’s protesters as a “virus”, which must be eradicated.On Wednesday the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters the department was delaying its first report to Congress assessing Hong Kong’s autonomy to “allow us to account for any additional actions that Beijing may be contemplating in the run-up to the National People’s Congress that would further undermine the people of Hong Kong’s autonomy as promised by China when they entered the agreement with the people of Hong Kong”.The Chinese Communist party (CCP) had delayed its meetings due to the coronavirus pandemic, but will now go ahead on 22 May.The report is mandated under a US law requiring Washington to assess Hong Kong’s political freedom and relationship with China, and to impose sanctions over any human rights abuses it uncovers.The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was first introduced in 2014 but eventually passed with bipartisan support last November after months of pro-democracy protests and alleged police brutality in Hong Kong.Pompeo was not asked about the delay by reporters in attendance, but observers have speculated it may be related to renewed pushes by Beijing to have Hong Kong enact national security legislation.Last month the head of Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong said the legislation – shelved since its introduction in 2003 sparked mass protests – must be reintroduced to combat radical violence, foreign interference and pro-independence forces in the region. It came amid accusations of interference and overreach by his office and the China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) over a series of public statements about Hong Kong.Beijing has been accused of taking advantage of the world’s focus on the pandemic to make provocative strategic moves, including crackdowns on the Hong Kong protests.More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested over the demonstrations, including more than a dozen high profile pro-democracy figures in February and March.On Wednesday the HKMAO released a statement calling protesters a “virus” who wanted to “drag Hong Kong off a cliff”. It said the “recklessly demented force” must be eliminated from the city, and warned that the more sympathy protesters had from Hong Kong residents, the greater price the city would pay.Human Rights Watch said the rhetoric was “chilling and disturbing” and indicated the CCP intended “to assume greater direct control over Hong Kong”.Several protesters told the  they found it alarming but not unexpected, and said they did not think it would deter the protest movement, which had reduced to smaller skirmishes and flash protests in the weeks prior to the pandemic.One said they felt the statement was an attempt to “dehumanise” protesters to allow authorities to use greater force against them.The operator of a social media account associated with the movement said the statement served as “an alarming signal for protesters, reminding us to get prepared ASAP to push back even harder against China’s erosion of Hong Kong’s almost-diminished autonomy”.“There is certainly fear of even more brutal crackdowns on protesters, but there are more and more small local gatherings in neighbourhood malls as the Covid pandemic has eased in Hong Kong, showing us that Hong Kongers have not forgotten our demands,” they said.On Thursday the Hong Kong government supported the HKMAO’s statement, saying the office was authorised by China’s central government to handle Hong Kong affairs and thus had the authority and responsibility to comment on major issues, RTHK News reported."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: : Brian LawlessPA The Green Party has appointed deputy leader Catherine Martin to lead a team of five in government formation talks.Ms Martin voted against entering into talks on coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil but said previously that she will engage “in good faith” with the talks process.Also on the Green Party negotiating team will be Ossian Smyth, Roderic O’Gorman, Neasa Hourgian and Marc Ó Cathasaigh. There will be a wider team of about 14 Green Party members who will feed into talks on different policy areas.The Greens will join Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil this evening for the first round of talks aimed at devising a programme for government.Three teams of four to five TDs from each party will meet and agree the timetable for talks this evening and to agree an overall strategy.Fine Gael has been led so far by a negotiating team compromising Simon Coveney, Paschal Donohoe, Hildegarde Naughton and Heather Humphreys.Internally, the party has already agreed “seven tests” that any future coalition must pass if a government is to be formed. The party believes that any future coalition needs to place the battle against Covid-19 at the heart of its goals. The coalition must also be stable and offer a plan to “lead change at critical times.”The party also wants to address the cost of living, develop a new jobs and recovery plan and implement a re-evaluated Sláintecare plan in a systematic way.Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael want to develop a new social contract and with the Green Party find a way to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. One source on a negotiating team said that the framework document recently agreed between the two larger parties will be “the bible” on which the talks are based.In that document, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil outlined 10 missions for any new government which included reviving the economy, finding a path towards universal healthcare, addressing the housing crisis and creating a new green deal.The Green Party has received written assurances from the other two parties that they are committed to reducing emissions targets by 7 per cent per annum for the next decade although the path to achieving this will have to be set out in talks.Outlining how he believes this target can met during the week, Eamon Ryan said that any agreed deal would have to involve a land use plan and there must also be a social focus. “That involves re-wetting our bogs, new types of forestry, new types of farming, getting farmers paid properly so young people can go into farming.”He said the second element will be around energy and he indicated he believes there is capacity for new offshore wind energy projects. Mr Ryan said there should also be a focus on the retrofitting of buildings.Meanwhile the leader of Aontú Peadar Tóibín TD and party councillor Sarah O’Reilly will also meet Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael negotiators today to take part in government formation talks.

He said her party’s ministers “promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor , reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet rolls after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean”.Ms McDonald had warned against stopping the pandemic payment and the re-introduction of austerity, criticising the Government’s approach.Mr Varadkar also rejected criticism that Ireland is slower to return to a new normal than other countries.“It is true we are slower than countries, much less affected than us like Australia, New Zealand, and slower than countries much worse affected than us, like Spain and Belgium.He said “this is a decision the Government made” and “it’s one we stand over”.He said he would rather be in a situation where the State might accelerate the pace of return than having to pause or reverse or re-impose restrictions, like some other countries. To have to do so would profoundly affect morale, Mr Varadkar said.He said the curve has been flattened and plateaued, but society’s grief had not. “The stakes are too high to rush things now.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4247328.1588854649!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lunar lockdown 2020 s last supermoon to light up irish skies","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe last supermoon of the year, the flower moon, will be visible in Irish skies on Thursday and Friday night.

Astronomy Ireland has urged the public to look to the East to see the supermoon rising tonight. “This is one of the closest full moons of the year, hence the name supermoon,” said David Moore, founder of Astronomy Ireland magazine. “There will be a second phenomenon known as ‘The Moon Illusion’ which makes the already bloated full moon look even bigger to the human eye, perhaps twice as large as normal.”There have been three supermoons already this year - which were visible on February 9th, March 9th and April 8th. This particular supermoon is known as the flower moon. Thursday night is due to be mainy dry with clear spells but a few scattered showers may occur along Atlantic coasts.

Photograph: Mark MitchellPoolGetty ImagesHairdressers, bars and competitive sport could be back on the agenda for New Zealanders from next week as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the country was “halfway down Everest” in its fight against Covid-19.New Zealand has been under strict lockdown restrictions for more than five weeks, but the low number of cases this week - zero for two consecutive days - means restrictions will soon be lifted.Ms Ardern and her cabinet will make a decision on downgrading the country’s alert level from three to two on Monday, and by Wednesday, life could begin to look much more normal - and fun - for millions of cooped-up Kiwis.The relaxation of restrictions, which would allow gatherings of up to 100 people, both indoors and outdoors, was greeted with jubilation across the country.Public spaces such as playgrounds and libraries would be reopened, bars and restaurants would be able to accept patrons, and domestic travel and competitive sport allowed to resume, including the professional leagues, but there will be no stadium crowds for now. Most workers would be allowed to head back to the office, though Ms Ardern urged any who could stay home - or found it more productive - to do so.Widespread social-distancing rules would continue to apply, including patrons being seated two metres apart in public spaces, strangers keeping their distance from one another, and hairdressers, barbers and beauticians being required to wear personal protective equipment.New Zealanders have been living in tight “bubbles” for more than a month, only allowed to socialise with those in their own home.Under the plans outlined by Ms Ardern on Thursday, they would be permitted to see friends, family and even online dates - so long as they keep a log of their movements, and did not participate in indoor or outdoor gatherings of any more than 100. Weddings, funerals and anniversary celebrations would also be permitted.New Zealand’s progress at beating coronavirus through its elimination strategy has been somewhat controversial, with the country experiencing the toughest lockdown measures in the world and the economy predicted to contract by up to 8 per cent this year, the International Monetary Fund has said.However, the measures appear to have been effective, with just 21 deaths - all older people with pre-existing health conditions - and global praise has been heaped on the small island nation of 5 million by the World Health Organisation, among others.The detailed description of life under level two was greeted with jubilation by Kiwis, many of whom have been desperate for a haircut and a change of company and scene.Jokes were made about the social-distancing restrictions for bars and clubs, with the prime minister saying such venues would be required to seat patrons and provide table service if they wanted to open.Under level two, the “bar” area of a bar would be off-limits because it has been identified as a transmission hotspot for the virus. This was evidenced by a cluster of dozens of people who went drinking at a pub in Matamata on St Patrick’s day in March.Speaking from the Beehive in Wellington, Ms Ardern said the fight against Covid-19 wasn’t won, but Kiwis should be proud of how quickly the country had got on top of the virus, compared with other countries. Less than 1,500 people have contracted the virus so far.“Every alert level to fight Covid-19 is its own battle. When you win one, it doesn’t mean the war is over,” Ms Ardern said.“There is a much higher level of inidual responsibly required at level two to prevent the spread of the virus. Even though the economy will be significantly opened up we still need everyone to remain vigilant and continue to act like you and those around you have the virus.“On Monday 11th May, we will make a decision on whether to move, taking into consideration the best data and advice we can, recognising the impact of restrictions, and ensuring we don’t put at risk all of the gains we have made.“We need to balance the risk of the virus bouncing back against the strong desire to get the economy moving again.”Although New Zealanders have been largely compliant with lockdown restrictions, police have still issued hundreds of warnings and fines to rule-breakers, the number of which sharply increased under level three.– Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4246775.1588790632!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels becomes increasingly jaded with uk s brexit drama","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  EU’s request for an  office in Northern Ireland is a technical issue unnecessarily politicised by Britain. Photograph: John ThysThere’s one word no one wants to hear in Brussels: Brexit. Profound weariness has set in in the European Union capital towards Britain’s project, even as talks stall to try to find an agreement to avoid a damaging lurch to default trade terms at the end of the year.There’s a sense of deja vu to the rows and speculation in the British press. Lately, the talk has returned to the idea of a “Canada-style deal”, with gossip that British negotiators could demand a copy of the bespoke arrangement tailored to the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship that took seven years to negotiate.“I’ve heard talk about a Canadian-style deal for a long time. In fact I think it generated a lot of internal debate in the British government around 2017,” trade commissioner Phil Hogan wearily told The  when asked about the idea. “It continues to be an issue.”Part of the jadedness is because the EU is busy dealing with the biggest economic shock in its history and the worst pandemic in a century. These are challenges nobody wanted. Brexit, on the other hand, was voluntary.Britain chose disruption, and much of the angst and delay associated with this is due to the fact that the government rushed into it without working out the details of what the point of it was in advance.London’s negotiators seem to have adjusted little to the post-Covid reality. Even as talks were delayed and moved to videoconference due to the pandemic, officials refused to countenance even the idea of extending the current transition period to allow more time for talks.Blast from past“It’s exceptional. Never in the history for such important negotiations with any third country, have we been under such time pressure,” an exasperated chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after the last round concluded without progress in the most contentious areas.Tuesday’s headline in the Financial Times – “Northern Ireland tensions threaten to derail Brexit long-term EU-UK deal” – was greeted as a blast from the past.This new rehearsal of the old theme relates to the EU’s request to set up an office in the North to work with local officials as they implement the complex new arrangements agreed in the withdrawal deal last year to avoid a hard border on the island.London recently started briefing that such an office would be isive, and dropping dark warnings about the Belfast Agreement, despite its diplomatic service having agreed to the idea last year.Until the talk of sovereignty from Westminster, it was a non-issue in the North itself. This is a carbon copy of events that led to the ditching of the so-called backstop, which only became a topic of contention after Conservative Party politicians began talking about it as “annexation”, giving unionists little choice but to oppose it.“I’m not aware that anyone in Northern Ireland of any persuasion was getting exercised about the EU office,” SDLP Assembly member Matthew O’Toole told The . “It was not a battleground in NI before the UK government started publicly suggesting it was unacceptable.”‘Territory question’It’s common for international organisations to have global offices, whether the United Nations or the OECD. The EU has over 129 – including, until Brexit became a reality at the end of January, one in Belfast. Even Northern Ireland itself has “Invest NI” offices in Brussels, Dusseldorf, Dubai, Manchester and Dubai. The North has long had bespoke diplomatic arrangements: it has its own office in the United States, the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC, which works there to promote “political, economic, educational, and cultural” links.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a territory question, because not even embassies count as territory, even though they are sometimes wrongly portrayed that way in the movies,” said Joris Larik, an expert in EU external relations at Leiden University.“Imagine it was the other way around,” Larik mused. “Imagine the UK wanted a technical office in Rotterdam or Hamburg or in an important EU member state that they do a lot of trade with, to help out with all the paperwork that is coming their way. I don’t think that would make the headlines, I just can’t imagine anybody would be interested in that. It’s an uninteresting piece of news.”For the EU, this is another example of a technical issue becoming unnecessarily politicised by Britain, and it’s increasingly a problem when it comes to something that agreement hinges on: trust.“There are increasing worries on the EU side that the British government isn’t really 100 per cent serious about implementing this . . . and then if you can’t even have an office . . .” Larik trailed off. “The Achilles’ heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn\u0027t happen here, he said.The decision taken on March 12 to abandon mass testing has also been questioned, with the Herald and others suggesting this meant the Government could only guess who was infected with the virus and how it was behaving, meaning the extent of its spread would not become obvious until hospitals began to fill with seriously ill patients.Across the Atlantic, similar questions are being asked.CNN this week broadcast a three-minute package asking what went wrong with the UK\u0027s initial handling of the virus, showing footage of packed Tube trains from the period before a lockdown was implemented, along with flashbacks to early Government briefings when the concept of Britain acquiring herd immunity guided its thinking.The New Yorker Magazine was even more forthright in its criticism – just as it has been of the Trump administration\u0027s response:In the above article published on Tuesday, it characterised Britain\u0027s handling of the pandemic as a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism... which has been slow and calamitous.The magazine pointed out that Britain has an internationally respected public health apparatus and that, in October 2016, the UK Government\u0027s Exercise Cygnus had shown how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation\u0027s health system and ravage the economy.Despite this, it says British officials dithered in the face of reports of a new coronavirus coming out of China and continued to hesitate as the virus tore through northern Italy, just at the point lessons needed to be learnt – and quickly.The British Government\u0027s short-lived adherence to the herd immunity theory was also criticised in Turkey, where the state-run Anadolu news agency published an op-ed by a researcher in international politics at Istanbul University suggesting that this distracted and prevented the UK Government from taking necessary steps at the time when they could have had significant impact on stemming the spread of the virus.Separately, the Reuters news agency focused, in a special report published on Tuesday, on Britain\u0027s failure to protect the elderly and their carers.Highlighting, among others, the case of 26-year-old care home worker Sonya Kaygan, one of over 100 UK front line health workers killed by coronavirus, it pointed out that care homes struggled to get access to tests and PPE.It also suggested the elderly were put at potentially greater risk by measures to admit only the sickest for hospital treatment and to clear out as many non-acute patients as possible from wards in order to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.Worse was to come, said the report, with the measures needed to protect the elderly in care homes,  such as testing and supplies of PPE, simply not available.In Spain, El País last week ran a stinging editorial, describing the UK Government\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as incomprehensible, with the article singling out Mr Johnson for criticism after he turned a deaf ear to the severity of the crisis for several weeks, to the point that he declined to attend five emergency committee meetings and instead enjoyed 12 joyful days of vacation.The initial plan of promoting herd immunity was condemned in the editorial as an uncompassionate approach and a Darwinian calculation, and it noted how the UK continued to allow planes from countries with large epidemics to land long after the risks of doing so were obvious.The editorial said Mr Johnson\u0027s Government was reckless in opting out of the joint procurement scheme for medical equipment alongside the 27 EU member states, and suggested Brexit chickens are coming home to roost as the NHS suffers personnel problems due to the Government\u0027s lack of interest in retaining European health workers.Everything points to Johnson choosing to disguise the economic and social costs of his hard Brexit with the even harder blows from the multiple crisis the pandemic is already causing, the article concluded.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains lockdown futile says swedish epidemiologist","story":"The architect of Sweden’s coronavirus strategy has claimed the UK’s lockdown has been largely “futile” in containing the virus. Johan Giesecke, a state epidemiologist in the Nordic country who advises the World Health Organisation, said the UK’s death toll suggested instating harsh social restrictions was not the best method of tackling the pandemic. Sweden has so far refused to impose the type of lockdown seen in other European countries, keeping open many schools, restaurants and businesses. The UK’s death toll is more than 10 times that of Sweden’s where fewer than 3,000 people have been killed by Covid-19 to date. Referring to the high coronavirus death toll across UK care homes, Prof Giesecke said: “A hard lockdown does not protect old and frail people living in care homes - a population the lockdown was designed to protect”.He added: “Neither does it decrease mortality from Covid-19, which is evident when comparing the UK’s experience with that of other European countries”.Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy “only pushes the severe cases into the future” and has not prevented them, Prof Gieseck argued.“There is very little we can do to prevent this spread: a lockdown might delay severe cases for a while, but once restrictions are eased, cases will reappear,” he said. Prof Gieseck argued that most people infected with covid-19 are healthy and young and it is in this section of the population that the “real pandemic” is occurring.Despite resisting strict lockdown measures, Sweden’s Public Health Institute estimated that the country’s R number, the number of people each infected person passes the virus to, fell from 1.4 at the start of April to 0.85 at the end of the month.Professor Giesecke has previously been critical of the pandemic modelling produced by the Imperial College London team led by Professor Neil Ferguson. He suggested Professor Ferguson’s projected death tolls were too pessimistic and rejected suggestions that Sweden will see a mounting mortality rate, saying in a Swedish newspaper interview: “On the contrary, I think it will go down.”Imperial College research, which helped to inform the UK’s strategy to the pandemic forecasted that Sweden’s approach would take its R number above 3, leading to 40,000 coronavirus deaths by May 1.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000000614099_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7OJWNt54phcP-0lBJzIYez7fhUBtWYECswaymtAuw4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ve day vital opportunity engage next generation remembrance","story":"\u0026#39The unique sense of appreciation for the past can come from something as simple as unearthing old photographs, or recognising a familiar name on a memorial\u0026#39For those of us who are of an age to recall it, VE Day was a momentous occasion which still stands out vividly in our memories. As we mark its 75th anniversary, we reflect on the courage and sacrifice of those who served in the Second World War, and the enormous human cost of the peace and liberty we have enjoyed since the victory in 1945. We offer these men and women from across the Commonwealth our eternal gratitude. Throughout my 50 years as president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), I have seen at first-hand the dedication and passion that has been channelled into ensuring the legacy of the fallen is not lost. Whether through the preservation of memorials or the diligent gathering of records of those who fought, we are ensuring people have the chance to reflect, learn and understand the scale of the conflicts. The anniversary of VE Day, along with that of the Normandy landings last year, and the centenary of the Great War in 2018, has rightly shone a spotlight on the bravery of service personnel, and provoked an outpouring of public admiration. These milestones provide an invaluable opportunity to put human faces to the names and numbers in our history books, and to reaffirm our commitment to remembrance. Most crucially, they allow us to educate our young people on the importance of the continuing remembrance of the war dead, so that we can ensure such atrocities never happen again. The unique sense of appreciation for the past can come from something as simple as unearthing old photographs, or recognising a familiar name on a memorial or, indeed, within the extensive, digital database of war records – how far we have come since the original, paper archives! And who could fail to be inspired by the spirit and sense of duty of those soldiers who are still with us today? By Mr Harry Billinge, the Normandy veteran campaigning to commemorate his fallen comrades? Or by Captain Tom Moore – now an honorary Colonel – who has raised a staggering amount for the NHS, in the days before his 100th birthday? But with each passing year, the ranks of those with a personal connection to the war are shrinking. That is why it is vital that we pass that baton of remembrance on to the next generation, and do all we can to ensure the voices and experiences of those who fought are not lost, or forgotten. Through my work with the CWGC, it has been my privilege to visit war cemeteries all over the world, to pay my respects. These memorials are, in many cases, the last physical reminders of the world wars, and it is a testament to the CWGC team that so many remain, with sites in 23,000 locations in 153 countries. It is thanks to their efforts that people will have the chance to visit them for centuries to come. But the task of engaging the next generation goes much further than the physical headstones and cenotaphs. With work due to begin – although postponed, given the current situation – on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in France, the CWGC will be creating new ways to explore the site while it undergoes much needed maintenance. Through an interactive exhibition utilising mobile devices and a walking trail, keen historians of all ages will be able to learn about the memorial and the battle, while engaging with the stories of those who fought.As the act of remembrance of the world wars enters the digital age, it is crucial that the spirit of reconciliation is not forgotten. As British and German soldiers exchanged fire, each did their duty, and so it is our duty to uphold the friendship that seemed impossible within living memory, and to come together as allies in remembrance of our shared past and our shared losses.As well as VE Day and VJ Day, 2020 marks 75 years since the bombing of Dresden. As patron of the Dresden Trust, which has worked to heal the relationship between Britain and Saxony, and as the son of an RAF officer who lost his life during the Second World War, I joined hands on February 13 this year with the president of Germany in a symbolic human chain. We stood together in the light of the Frauenkirche – badly damaged in 1945, and today topped by a golden orb and cross a gift from the British, to the people of Dresden. On the anniversary of VE Day, we celebrate peace and we pay tribute to the men and women who died for it. But let us also reflect on the lessons learned and the relationships built, in order to ensure a lasting legacy of the dead for the next 100 years, and beyond.The Duke of Kent is president of the Commonwealth War Graves CommissionCoronavirus latest news: Lockdown to be formally extended by three weeks today Politics latest news: Boris Johnson to proceed with \u0026#39extreme caution\u0026#39 when setting out exit strategyCoronavirus timeline: From a few cases in China to a global pandemicThe inside story of how Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret celebrated VE DayComment: No 10\u0026#39s plans for lifting lockdown may bitterly disappoint the nationVE Day 2020: why is it a bank holiday and how can you celebrate in lockdown?Social distancing: What are the rules and how might they change?When will the UK lockdown end?

But this vast 16th century mansion, set in 9000 acres in the middle of rural Wiltshire, was also the grand backdrop to my teenage years, and the place where I celebrated VE Day aged 14.During the Second World War, many public schools were evacuated from cities to the safety of stately homes dotted around the country. In 1939, the pupils and teachers of the Royal School for the Daughters of Officers of the Army were kindly taken in by the 5th Lord Bath after being evacuated from their grounds in Bath.The Royal School offered a subsidised education for daughters from senior military families, and my father, Brigadier Harry Obbard, had been stationed in India with the Royal Engineers since the thirties. While he was abroad, my mother Sybil and I had a rather peripatetic existence, moving from one B\u0026ampB to another. The stability in my life came from the schools I attended.When I arrived at Longleat in 1944, I was taken under the wing of a girl called Rosemary Stewart, whose father, Brigadier Guy Stewart, had been Churchill’s Director of War Plans. Tragically, he’d been killed in a plane crash after accompanying Churchill to the Casablanca Conference.We may have been shielded from the visible sights and sounds of war, bar the odd buzz of a distant Doodlebug, but many girls, like Rosemary, were grieving. Others, like me, were left worrying about our fathers, most of whom were fighting in far-flung corners of the world.Communication with relations could be sporadic. There were letters from our mums, and a drip-feed of information from teachers, but despite being cut off from the outside world, I recall excitement mounting as news filtered through Germany was on the brink.On Tuesday 8 May, we were summoned to an assembly in the Great Hall where our headmistress, Miss Harding, told us the incredible news: victory in Europe.I remember a huge feeling of relief and quiet celebration, but I was also conscious of holding back because of Rosemary. It was a bittersweet moment for those whose fathers had been killed or who were still holed up in Japanese prisoner of war camps.Picnics were handed round, which we ate in excited huddles in our form rooms or in the grounds, and we were allowed to skip lessons. In order to get a feel of the real world, we wandered down to Horningsham, the local village, to see Union Jacks being hung out – for once able to leave our gas masks behind.There wasn’t a street party to speak of, but a result of the excitement – and rather scandalously - a party was laid on for the sixth-formers with the local battalion of American GIs. The soldiers were stationed in the forest at Longleat, and we barely caught sight of them, but they were the subject of much gossip and I remember me and my friends watching enviously as the sixth-formers set off in their regulation silk dresses and roller-curled hair.When we see pictures of London thronged with people waving flags and the princesses on the balcony, it’s tempting to think it must have felt like the end of the hardship. But to us, it was more the beginning of the end.In many ways, life at Longleat continued in the same vein. Rationing was still ongoing and bread became scarcer. Even though blackout restrictions were lifted after VE Day, when I look back, I can only remember how isolated we felt during evenings there.As that summer wore on, and we played cricket on the lawns, we were conscious of the bitter battle being fought in Japan, and it wasn’t until VJ Day on August 15 that we could finally believe it was truly all over.Two years ago, I took my grandson Matthew, 17, back to see Longleat. It was the only the second time I’d visited since I returned to school in 1947. While much had changed, there were still many echoes of the past. I was transported back to a world of frosty bedrooms, weekly baths, and fruit cake during prep on a Sunday evening.Where tourists now gawp and take pictures, we’d gathered rosehips and nettles for the war effort, and posed for House photos. As I showed Matthew around, I was moved to see how the house had evolved, and thrived, but also amused to know that, if I peeled back a bit of carpet in the Long Salon, I’d still be able to see the stains of our water jugs. We left our mark on this great house – I remember one girl knocking a finger off a statue.When the funeral of the 5th Lord Bath happened in 1946 we all formed a Guard of Honour for him. He’d been lovely to us and on our birthdays we’d leave cake outside his suite of rooms. When the 7th Lord Bath recently died of coronavirus, it made me sad to think that he wouldn’t be afforded same kind of send-off as his grandfather, who lay in state for two days in the grand hall, which was filled with rhododendrons, while staff and villagers came to pay their respects.Although he would have been around the same age as us, we didn’t really see him much when we were at Longleat. They lived elsewhere on the estate, but we used to see his father Henry when he came to visit the big house. He was very austere, and didn’t like us being there at all. Totally unlike the 7th Lord Bath whose life I followed with interest afterwards - he was a true eccentric English aristocrat. I hope he gets the Memorial he deserves when all this is over.In normal times, I’d have loved to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day by visiting Longleat with my family. Now of course, that’s not possible.Instead, I’ll spend it alone in my flat where I live alone in Aylesbury. My son Edward has always called my time at Longleat my “privileged past” but while it was a privilege to be surrounded by such beautiful things, I always tell him it was bloody cold, there wasn’t much food. It was still an institution!What we went through then has given me the fortitude to cope with these current days of uncertainty. It’s sad to see my grandchildren experiencing such turmoil, but what I’ll tell them is that we had the strength as a country to rebuild back then, and we have it in us to do that again now.     More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/06/16/bangladesh-garment-factory.jpg","title":"coronavirus clothes workers bangladesh high street shut","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Coronavirus could be the final nail in the coffin of the unsustainable fast fashion industry. But with some retailers failing to share the economic pain with suppliers, its demise could be fatal for millions of workersIn his factory in Chittagong, Bangladesh’s main port and trading hub, Mostafiz Uddin has a mountain stacked high of 100,000 pairs of jeans with nowhere to go.The piles of denim – stonewashed, black, skinny fit, turn-ups, shorts and more – had been destined for shops on UK high streets owned by Philip Green’s Arcadia empire, to satisfy our seemingly unquenchable thirst for fast fashion.But it appears we may have realised we didn’t need them after all.\u0026nbspAs millions of us sit at home under lockdown conditions, and thousands of others have lost their jobs, demand for clothing has collapsed. Britons bought 35 per cent less clothes in March than in the month before – and that was before lockdown measures were fully introduced.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesExtrapolate that trend across the global apparel trade and the numbers are truly staggering. The industry is worth $1.5 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year – about half the size of the UK’s entire annual economic output. Most of those clothes are made in poor countries and bought in rich ones. Low prices have been key.Some retailers have sought to share the unprecedented economic pain of Covid-19 with their suppliers. Sweden’s H\u0026ampM took the early lead, saying it would honour all existing contracts for goods ordered. Zara owner, Spanish giant Inditex, followed suit with a similar pledge.What was the Rana Plaza disaster and why did it happen?Others, such as\u0026nbspPrimark, took a hard-line approach, cancelling hundreds of millions of pounds of orders before partially backtracking in the face of a surge of bad publicity. UK retailer Next agreed this week to honour some of its orders.Asda, owned by US retail giant Walmart, is enjoying a bumper period of trade, but decided to pay its suppliers half for finished garments and 30 per cent for unfinished ones. It’s since softened some of its demands.Then there are the worst offenders who are still refusing to budge.Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which owns brands including Dorothy Perkins, Topshop, and Miss Selfridge, has been among them. Uddin’s company, Denim Expert, received terse letters in March and April, stating bluntly that orders for hundreds of thousands of pieces of clothing had been cancelled with immediate effect.Items already shipped would be subject to a 30 per cent discount, Arcadia said, in a few lines of text that more than wiped out Uddin’s mark-up of between 5 and 10 per cent.“You can make better margins,” he says. “But not if you pay workers properly and do things sustainably, as we do.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAll other Arcadia orders that have already been made, including some that have already shipped, were cancelled. There was no negotiation. It was an order.Even more egregious are the demands of Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM), a stable of high street names that includes Peacocks, Jaeger and Bonmarche among others. It is owned by retail billionaire Philip Day and operates more than 1,000 stores across the UK.In March, EWM cancelled orders with Uddin’s company for tens of thousands of items and demanded 70 per cent discounts on millions of pounds worth of goods that had already been made, handing a huge loss to suppliers.These orders were not for seasonal summer items that Peacocks could not sell, but for standard lines of jeans that EWM did not want to have to pay money to store in warehouses. Even in the current circumstances, such huge reductions were unheard of.With no buyer for his jeans and little room for storage,\u0026nbspUddin\u0026nbspfears a significant proportion of the fruits of his workers’ labour will end up in landfill. “It’s a huge environmental problem,” he says\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspspoke to him on International Workers’ Day.Garment industry workers, already among the most precarious in the world, face destitution with no social security safety net.Uddin\u0026nbspprides himself on treating workers ethically and with respect. So far, he has continued to pay his 2,000 mostly young, female employees so that they in turn can continue to feed the thousands more mouths who depend on their modest incomes. Others have not been able to, or have chosen not to, do so. And time is fast running out.The apparel business runs on small margins and lots of credit. As orders are cancelled and banks begin to call in their loans a humanitarian disaster that is hitting Bangladesh at a particularly poignant time.It’s Ramadan, the holy month in which Muslims – including\u0026nbspUddin’s\u0026nbsp2,000 staff – devote themselves to prayer, fasting and charitable deeds.Seven years ago this month, emergency workers were trawling through the rubble of\u0026nbspRana\u0026nbspPlaza, an unsafe and poorly maintained garment factory in Dhaka that collapsed, crushing 1,137 people to death. In early May 2013, weeks after the initial collapse, the search was finally called off and the industry vowed, “never again”.EWM is owned by Philip Day, a fashion billionaire who worked his way up from a childhood on a Stockport council estate to build an estimated £1.2bn fortune. He owns a castle in Carlisle, officially lives in Switzerland and spends a lot of his time in Dubai, where his acquisition company Spectre is registered. He reportedly bought his first helicopter from Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.Like Ashley and Green, Day has been phenomenally successful in building a huge retail operation. It boasts more than 1,000 stores and over 25,000 staff. While his profile may be lower, his methods are similarly controversial.Companies who have not committed to honouring contracts for existing ordersHis reputation for buying up struggling high street names and turning them around has landed him with a reputation\u0026nbspas a saviour of Britain’s ailing high streets. However, some view him more of an asset stripper, who gets hold of failing brands while using insolvency laws to ensure that suppliers are left with nothing.His takeover of Jaeger attracted criticism from suppliers and some observers. With the high-end fashion brand failing, he purchased the brand name but did not pay for the company’s assets. When the company fell into administration shortly afterwards, suppliers who had already handed over stock to Jaeger received just 2p for every pound they were owed.Critics suggest he is using similar “financial engineering” to turn a profit from struggling Bonmarche, the clothing retailer Peacocks bought for just £5.7m last year which then went into administration. A spokesperson for EWM said Mr Day lost out financially from the administration.Suppliers in Bangladesh and beyond now allege that they too are receiving unfair treatment from Mr Day’s company.“I’ve been told by Peacocks the goods are cancelled,” says Uddin. “We told them that we have bought raw materials from the factory but they are not replying to our emails. We get automated responses. They just don’t care.”We do not want charity. We just want companies to pay their bills and respect their contractsArcadia is little better, says Uddin. “They have cancelled around $2.5m of orders. This will be a disaster for me and my workers.”A spokesperson for Peacocks said the company contacted suppliers as soon as possible to provide them with options once it was clear high streets were seeing a downturn in sales. “This was an essential step as, otherwise we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell,” the company said. “We have since entered negotiations with suppliers inidually, with the options tailored to the inidual suppliers.”Arcadia did not respond to requests for comment.Across Bangladesh, companies have cancelled an estimated $3.5bn of orders. For a country that generates the majority\u0026nbspof its export income from clothing sales, this could spell disaster.Bangladeshi factory owners like Uddin are now effectively being asked to subsidise Philip Green, the former king of British retail, and his apparent heir, Philip Day.Seven years after Rana Plaza, Uddin, like many manufacturers in the trade, feels he is treated with little\u0026nbspmore respect than he was\u0026nbspback then.“There was no negotiation, no discussion, no partnership or respect. No co-ordination. Nothing. You accept the discount or take the goods. How can I take the goods when they’re already in a UK port?” he asks.“We have bought the raw materials, we have produced the garments, we have invested the money and we will not be able to survive.“We will\u0026nbspliterally die. It will be impossible for us to handle this. Our workers will be suffering a\u0026nbsplot. I have no words to express what it will do to us.”“The goods are ready. They should take the goods. If they have a problem they can wait for a month or for 45 days. There should be some discussion but they just sent an email saying that the orders are cancelled. How is this possible?”Since February, buyers for Uddin’s company have cancelled around $10.5m\u0026nbspof orders – a big chunk of his annual turnover. Globally, the Workers’ Rights Consortium estimated that $24bn\u0026nbspof orders have been cancelled –\u0026nbspthough this has likely reduced as some brands have made new commitments in the face of a wave of bad publicity.Global clothing buyers have made big claims in recent years to have cleaned up their act.Yet, even before the coronavirus hit demand, increased pressure to cut prices had already seen wages in the sector fall 15 per cent. In the past two months, an estimated 60 million low-paid garment industry workers have had their livelihoods put at risk as major brands and retailers have sought to dump the financial burden of the crisis on those further down the supply chain.Fiona Gooch, senior policy adviser at\u0026nbspTraidcraft Exchange, said:\u0026nbsp“We’re appalled that Peacocks and Arcadia are demanding discounts on clothes which have already been made just for them. In the middle of this terrible coronavirus crisis, the multi-millionaire businessmen who own these brands are abusing their power. And at the end of the day, it’s the poorly paid young women who make their clothes who will lose their jobs if the manufacturers go bust. We’ve seen other high street brands like Next and Primark start to respond to public pressure and commit to paying for more orders in full. It’s about time that Peacocks and Arcadia did the same.”EWM says it had no choice but to demand discounts. Its latest accounts published in December showed that, unlike many retailers, it had no bank debt and had turned a healthy profit. It decided not to pay a idend to shareholders as it wanted to pump money into making more acquisitions.Uddin believes the company is trying to take advantage of the coronavirus\u0026nbspcrisis to obtain massive discount.Peacocks says it gave suppliers three options: They could keep hold of the stock and sell it locally they could accept a large discount or they could be paid for it when\u0026nbspPeacocks eventually took delivery and sold the stock to consumers.These aren’t really options at all, according to Uddin. Like most garment manufacturers, he borrowed the money to make the jeans (which were ordered back in August last year). He can’t wait for Peacocks to potentially sell them in a year’s time before payment. His workers need wages now.“My workers’ lives are under threat because we are an export company,” he says. “We only get the money when we complete the export. If we don’t export we don’t get the money.”Inditex, which owns Zara, has by contrast, used its strong pile of cash to honour contracts with suppliers.An immediate solution is needed to prevent millions of impoverished workers becoming destitute, says the Workers’ Rights Consortium.The power relationship between buyers and suppliers in the fashion industry is among the most unequal of any sector. Contracts reflect that inequality with buyers dictating whatever terms suit them. Legal remedies are too costly and take too much time, as buyers are well aware.There are signs that bad publicity is beginning to shame retailers into action. Some companies have agreed to step in to pay wages of some workers but this amounts to only a small fraction of the orders cancelled, says Olivia Windham Stewart, a leading campaigner on the issue.Many other retailers, including John Lewis, Gap, Arcadia Asos, Sports Direct, have yet to make firm commitments.“We do not want charity,” says Uddin. “We just want companies to pay their bills and respect their contracts.”Beyond the immediate crisis, the situation may only be fixed by legislation in wealthy countries forcing companies to take responsibility for their supply chains. At present, they remain almost entirely unaccountable.Last year, the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee recommended that the UK government should legally require fashion retailers to take responsibility for environmental and human rights issues in their supply chains.The government rejected all of the recommendations.But change may finally be coming. Last week, the EU commissioner for justice announced the Commission would introduce “mandatory corporate environmental and human rights due diligence” across all sectors. Perhaps, says Olivia Windham Stewart, the UK will have to follow suit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is it too expensive? What reforms should the government be looking at? Ben Chu assesses the evidenceThe government’s coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has, on the face of it, been a stand out success.So far, according to HMRC, some 800,000 businesses have successfully tapped the new subsidy programme, putting 6.3 million of their employees, around a fifth of the entire UK labour force, on furlough.Beware a second wave of job losses, not just the virusSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s reasonable to assume that\u0026nbspin the absence of the scheme a large proportion of those employees would have been made redundant and the wave of joblessness currently breaking over the UK would have been significantly greater.Yet there are also now noises coming out of the Treasury suggesting that the scheme might, in some respects, have been too successful – that so many companies have accessed the support that withdrawing it could prove agonisingly difficult. The chancellor,\u0026nbspRishi Sunak, has also raised concerns over the spiralling cost of the support to the public purse.Are such fears warranted? And with the chancellor due to issue an update on the policy next week, what should the government’s next steps be when it comes to supporting both workers and firms through this crisis?The costs and the benefitsIn an interview with ITV News on Monday Mr Sunak said the furlough scheme – whereby the state picks up 80 per cent of the cost of an employees wages up to a ceiling of £2,500 a month – was potentially as expensive as funding the NHS.“That is not a sustainable situation,” he said.The estimated cost of the support extended so far is around £8bn. The scheme is currently due to expire on 30 June, but there is no cap on the number of firms who can tap it in that time. The Office for Budget Responsibility put out a scenario last month that had the scheme costing £42bn over three months.The cost of running the health service\u0026nbspfor three months is around £45bn, which is the likely basis for the chancellor’s comparison.Yet it’s a mistake to view the job subsidy as a pure public cost.If those millions of workers were unemployed instead of furloughed that would entail a much higher state welfare bill, via unemployment and other benefits.And the fact that the scheme keeps workers linked to their employers – meaning they can be put back to work rapidly when the crisis is over – should also, theoretically, be more economically efficient than redundancies and attempted re-hirings.Avoiding the cliff-edgeNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBusiness lobby groups have raised the alarm over a potential wave of redundancies when the scheme ends.The problem for many businesses is that they do not know what the state of demand for their goods and services will be in two months’ time.Many suspect that it will not be as strong as it was prior to the lockdowns. If that’s the case they may feel they need to reduce their workforce. Yet there’s a legal consultation period for making redundancies of between 30 to\u0026nbsp45 days.If the support ended\u0026nbspsuddenly at the end of June that would mean they would have to start making redundancies very soon if they wanted to have downsized their workforce by the time of the economy re-opening.Lobby groups say the government should remove this cliff\u0026nbspedge facing firms by committing now to extend the scheme past June and allowing some workers to return on a part-time basis.There’s some discussion of the government tapering down financial support\u0026nbsprather than removing it all at a stroke, such as by covering a smaller share of an employee’s wages.This, of course, would have financial implications for the Treasury.Some around Mr Sunak have, apparently, suggested that companies are in danger of becoming “addicted” to the scheme.And one of his predecessors, Norman Lamont, has argued that it might provide a “false sense of security” for people because their jobs are not likely to return after the scheme ends – that furlough is merely delaying the inevitable.Economists says the addiction analogy is inaccurate and most strongly support the broad principles of the scheme.Yet there is a concern about some of the incentives created by the scheme, such as the effective pressure on companies to furlough employees entirely to access the subsidy, rather than to merely reduce their hours.It could also conceivably discourage firms from re-opening as early as they otherwise would.The furlough scheme is also\u0026nbsplikely to prevent some workers from searching for work elsewhere, even when this might be in their own long-term interests.At a time when the economy is still in lockdown this might not represent a major economic problem. But as hiring picks up it could become one.The trade-off facing policymakers is in extending the support to protect certain firms and allowing the normal, broad, employment market incentives to operate.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the government should try to identify sectors where many furloughed employees are less likely to\u0026nbspreturn to work as normal – citing hotels and restaurants – and act to reduce barriers to these iniduals taking alternative work.Mike Brewer of the Resolution Foundation, the think tank that originally proposed the furlough scheme, says that it was the right policy at the time it was introduced, but agrees that it needs adjusting for the next phase of the crisis.“What we need is a scheme that encourages and allows employers to adjust, encourages and allows work to happen where it can do so safely and tries to avoid millions of families seeing a huge income hit,” he says.“Doing all those is really, really hard.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The quiet roads, the clean air, hedgehog nirvana...Yet we know it can’t last.This week the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the main industry body, reported that the number of vehicles on our roads had reached a record 40.4 million in 2019. That’s rather more than one for everyone with a driving licence. Some 35 million of them are cars, the rest an increasing number of vans and 607,008 lorries, the highest in 30 years.Their numbers are in part boosted by the rise of online shopping (which will probably see a step change upwards after the lockdown\u0026nbsphas passed). They’re not moving much now, most of them, but they’ll be back.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYour home is more important than you think when owning an electric carThe recent extremely weak oil price will mean cheaper oil and diesel, which won’t help the electric cause. Petrolheads have their eyes on that 6 litre twelve cylinder used Bentley Continental GT they’ve always lusted after (I’ve some sympathy there).The SMMT\u0026nbspsay that only 92,913 of the total UK “parc” as the trade calls it, are pure electric vehicles - battery-only rather than hybrids also running an internal combustion engine 0.2 per cent.Electric vehicle sales enjoyed a brief boomlet in the brief space between the Chancellor’s Budget, which pre-announced cuts in subsidies, and the lock down. Sales\u0026nbspof everything have now collapsed.What I\u0027ve learned so far about driving electric carsYet when we all go back to normal driving - statistically most likely in a black eight-year old Ford Fiesta - we will also go back to spewing out CO2 and generating vast amounts of vroomy din, but this latest global\u0026nbspshock might just persuade us of a couple of things.First, that it doesn’t have to be this way, and the electric car (and delivery van) means we can have our cake (personal mobility) and eat it (clean air, peaceful streets).Second, more abstrusely, we might consider where the next planet-wide disaster is going to come from. In fact, it was possible to see the approach of the financial crisis of 2008, the waves of war and terror, and the various pandemics of the twenty first century, including this one, and to have done something about them. There were signs and warnings.You can see where I’m heading with this can’t you? I’m sorry to be so obvious, but the climate emergency is the next disaster, except that it is already just about upon us. Terrified as we may be now, we can’t allow ourselves to forget about that.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe report follows comments made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has consistently denounced\u0026nbspthe lockdown\u0026nbspin the United States. The US has more confirmed\u0026nbspcoronavirus cases than any other country in the world,\u0026nbsprecently topping one million.Mr Musk said the lockdown was “fascist” and demanded authorities “give people back their goddamn freedom”.Elon Musk tweet about \u0027too high\u0027 share price sees Tesla plummet $14bn“I would call it ‘forcibly imprisoning people in their homes’ against all their constitutional rights, in my opinion, and breaking people’s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came to America or built this country,” Mr Musk also said in a call last week.However, despite the potential for the plant to re-open, a spokesperson for the Fremont Police Department said there were no plans to investigate the site.“We’re all sort of in a little bit of a grey area,” said department spokesperson Geneva Bosques. This is because of the state governor\u0027s announcement that some business would be allowed to operate on a small scale if adequate safety measures were taken.Two previous visits were made to the plant, Mr Bosques said, where it was found that Tesla was following basic minimum operations.It would not be the first time that Tesla has defied shelter-in-place orders. The company insisted workers continue for a week after 17 March, when the conditions were put in place, even though the plant was deemed non-essential by health authorities. The order, which remains in place, forbids “manufacturing or assembly of nonessential products.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world. None of us wants this to happen ever again but to prevent future outbreaks, there are some difficult lessons we must learn.“If we continue to stress wild animals by decimating their habitats and capture and cage them in markets — and if we continue to mass produce domesticated animals inside squalid factory farms and transport them long distances — there will be no avoiding a future pandemic.”T Colin Campbell, professor emeritus of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, New York, claimed: “A wholefoods plant-based diet can prevent, perhaps even reverse, the chronic degenerative diseases that make older iniduals more susceptible to Covid-19.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For families in a two-bedroom home, the shortfall is as high as £400 a month outside of London, and up to £1,227 in the capital.Shelter says that those relying on benefits must find an estimated £13m a week in total to keep up with their rent payments.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe government has suspended evictions for the duration of the crisis, but thousands could be forced out of their homes when the lockdown ends.Polly Neate, chief executive at Shelter, has warned of a “tsunami of evictions” amid the “serious financial difficulty” that people across the country are now facing.“As renters lose their jobs and see their incomes hit, many will have to rely on the welfare safety net for the first time,” she said.“Our services are already hearing from families in homes they could comfortably afford under normal circumstances, who are now in serious financial difficulty.“We’re facing an onslaught of people suddenly unable to afford their rent, at a time when people need to stay put and cannot safely move to a cheaper home.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Even with the deferral we’ll have to pay it back at some point anyway.“Nobody knows when we will be able to earn again, so we are stuck.\u0026nbsp We have just got to pare everything back and keep our heads above water if we can.

The fresh, raw produce comes daily from The Felix Project, the biggest distributor of surplus food in London, which has quadrupled its deliveries since lockdown to 40 tonnes a day and supplies daily more than 100 charities, schools and community hubs like Compassion London.The Independent has pledged to raise £10m to help The Felix Project feed hungry people across the capital over the next three years – with £3.65m already donated since we launched our appeal on 27 March.The Wembley facility is being given to Compassion London free of charge, thanks to Wembley Stadium, its in-house caterer Delaware North and the stadium’s owner, the Football Association.Top restaurant chefs join forces to provide free meals for familiesPhoebe Waller-Bridge backs our appealOur appeal raises £3.5m as food crisis deepensHead chef Mr Lomas said: “Using an empty kitchen and bringing food together to feed vulnerable people and the NHS is fantastic.

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true. There’s been a rapid acceleration of testing offer the last few months in this country, including getting to 100,000 tests a day.“We’ve been entirely transparent on the way that that has been measured throughout, and I have confidence that the rate will continue to rise.“Currently capacity is 108,000 a day, and we are working to build that higher.“Of course, we’ve been working very hard to make the testing capacity grow as fast as possible and as more tests are available so we are able to make them available\u0026nbsp to more people and test people right across the NHS.”The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman later said: It may be at the moment there is less demand for tests from key workers because the infection rate is stablising or falling. I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased.

The leadership of the Labour Party was number one, fair or unfair.”Sir Keir, who campaigned for Labour to adopt a pro-EU stance and was largely sidelined by party strategists during the campaign, also said Brexit was another issue raised on the doorstep of voters.Starmer calls for \u0027national consensus\u0027 on lifting lockdownOn Labour’s strategy during the coronavirus pandemic, Sir Keir said his party needed to be “constructive” when criticising No 10’s failures, as he confirmed in a separate interview he would support another extension to the UK-wide lockdown.Pressed on the issue on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme, he said he believed the restrictions should remain in place until “we are sure the infection rate has gone down”.Later today, Boris Johnson will decide whether to extend the lockdown by another three weeks, but is not expected to address the nation until Sunday evening where he will also set out the government’s next steps in the crisis and any restrictions that may be eased in the coming weeks.Sir Keir added: “I would be very surprised if the government doesn’t reimpose the lockdown when it comes up for review later on and we will support them in that. This is not about lifting the lockdown now, it’s about planning for the future.“Of course we want the number of infected cases to go down, we want the death toll to go down but we’ve got to also plan for the future and I’m convinced testing, tracing and isolating is going to have to be a part of any strategy fro the future.“But if that’s going to happen the planning needs to go in now because we need many many more tests than we’ve got already”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s likely the true circumstances are somewhat\u0026nbspdifferent\u0026nbsp— but no less horrific. Oliver Carroll reports from MoscowIn Russia, the news this week should have been about Covid-19 taking ever greater chunks out of the country. An unexpected surge in infections has, after all, made it the fifth-most affected nation on earth — with little sign of the crisis abating.Instead, headlines around the world have been dominated by a more unusual effect of the virus in Russia - a\u0026nbspspree\u0026nbspof frontline workers falling out of windows.In the course of eight days from 24 April to 2 May, three medics plunged to the ground. Two have already been buried by their colleagues one is fighting for his life in intensive care with a fractured skull. In all three cases, there is evidence of serious conflict with hospital authorities over the coronavirus response.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome international media have used these tragedies to tempt\u0026nbspreaders into the assumption that\u0026nbspRussian medics are being shadowed by government hitmen. In doing so, they draw attention away from a far more likely reality, and one that is no less horrific.From conversations with friends and colleagues of the victims, The Independent\u0026nbsphas pieced together a picture of medical staff working under intolerable strain. The victims were pinched at least two ways: inadequately protected while working face to face with an invisible killer and\u0026nbsppushed to the brink by a management class petrified of losing status and privilege.Face to face with coronavirus on a Moscow Covid-19 wardRussia would not be alone in seeing its medical staff succumb to apparent suicide amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Across Europe and the United States, doctors, nurses, and ambulance staff have taken their lives as a direct result of the virus. Some were\u0026nbspfearful after contracting the disease, and left suicide notes about their despair. Others feared infecting others.But in Russia, a cocktail of guilt, secrecy and scapegoating seems to be exacerbating the stresses and strains of working through the pandemic.Scapegoating seems to be the most obvious trigger for the first of the deaths on April 24. Up until her untimely end, Natalya Lebedeva\u0026nbspwas an experienced ambulance service manager working in Star City, the restricted cosmonaut training outpost fifteen miles east of Moscow. Lebedeva died after falling from the fifth floor of a hospital in south-east Moscow where she had been receiving treatment for Covid-19. She was 48.According to a colleague, bosses had placed Lebedeva in charge of hospitalising important Covid-19 patients from Star City. Unfortunately, she became infected in the process and unwittingly formed part of a chain of infections that saw almost two dozen people hospitalised. The colleague, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed to The Independent that superiors had blamed Lebedeva for failing to contain the virus locally. This seems to have led her to take her own life.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastJust one day following Ms Lebedeva\u0027s apparent suicide, a second medic would fall five floors from a hospital window. Yelena Nepomnyashaya, 47, the acting head doctor at the veterans\u0027 hospital in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, died from her injuries a week later.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA source in the veterans\u0027 hospital described the manager as an upbeat inidual who was well-liked by staff. But she was also reportedly\u0026nbspuneasy with the local authority\u0027s plans to use the hospital to fulfil a presidential quota for additional Covid-19 capacity. The hospital wasn\u0027t yet ready for such a switch, Nepomnyashaya believed: it had only one ventilator and inadequate stocks of protective equipment. Right up to her death, the head doctor was pushing to have the equipment in place, the source said.There is some confusion as to what conversations took place between the hospital chief and Boris Nemik, the local health minister. The regional bureaucrat denies any contact was made. But\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s source insists otherwise: that a conference call took place shortly before Nepomnyashaya fell to her death.Yelena wasn\u0027t unstable or an obvious suicide risk, but god only knows\u0026nbspthe threats and impossible demands that were made, the source said. The thing we all fear now is that her death will be written off as the suicide of an unhinged woman who could not cope.The thing we all fear now is that her death will be written off as the suicide of an unhinged woman who could not cope.The third incident, which took place a week later, is more enigmatic. Paramedic Alexander Shulepov, 37, fell from the first floor of a hospital while receiving treatment for Covid-19. He remains in intensive care with serious injuries including a fractured skull.Again, there are signs of a\u0026nbspconflict with management over\u0026nbspCovid-19. Just 10 days earlier, Shulepov recorded a video with fellow paramedic Alexander Kosyakin. In the widely-shared clip, the two ambulance workers are seen complaining about lack of protective equipment and, in Shulepov\u0027s case, allegedly being forced to work with an active coronavirus infection.Kosyakin was later summoned by police and cautioned about spreading fake news about Covid-19, a criminal offence under Russian law. Shulepov would in time\u0026nbspretract the video, saying that he had recorded it in an emotional state.It is impossible to know what might have gone on in Shulepov\u0027s mind or on the ward that caused him to fall out of a window. But foul play would on balance seem unlikely: a first-floor window is not the most effective way to do away with an opponent without leaving a trace. It will likely be many weeks, if ever, before we get clarity about the affair. Both relatives and colleagues said they had been asked not to comment while the investigation is ongoing.Dmitry Belyakov, chair of Russia\u0027s independent ambulance workers\u0027 union\u0026nbspand a working paramedic, said he had no reason to doubt the three incidents were suicides or attempts. But even so, he could not accept the cause of their death was accidental.The system is not set up for people to work normally or honestly, and it provokes incidents such as this.Instead, Belyakov placed the blame firmly at the door of management. Bosses are struggling to cope with an upsurge in Covid-19 across the country, he suggested, and had prioritised relations with their superiors over the wellbeing of staff.Managers don\u0027t know what to do, so they have taken to scapegoating the middle-rung people, he said.\u0026nbspExhausted enough by the pandemic, they are throwing themselves out of windows.Belyakov said many of his members had contacted him to complain about unrealistic demands and working without\u0026nbspproper protective kit. As a rule, his members have little leverage over working conditions. Most ambulance workers in Moscow are not local, the union activist said, so are beholden to huge debts, rents and mortgage payments, alongside\u0026nbspthe whims of managers. No one has declared a state of emergency or cancelled repayments, he added.Other medics\u0026nbspsuggested that the Covid-19 pandemic had simply cast new light on an\u0026nbspage-old problem.\u0026nbspDeaths among medical staff had become more tragic because people were paying attention, said Alexei Erlikh, a consultant\u0026nbspcardiologist and\u0026nbsphead of intensive care at Moscow\u0027s Hospital Number 29. The system is not set up for people to work normally or honestly, and it provokes incidents such as this.In the absence of official statistics, Erlikh is one of a group of doctors who have taken to compile a memorial list of colleagues who have fallen victim\u0026nbspto Covid-19. The list, which includes four medics\u0026nbspfrom neighbouring Belarus,\u0026nbspcurrently stands at 113.\u0026nbspLebedeva and Nepomnyashnaya\u0026nbspstand\u0026nbspat positions 57 and 68 respectively.The doctor said it was inevitable that more doctors, paramedics and nurses would take their lives as the pandemic widens its reach across Russia in the coming weeks and months. Moscow is one story, he said when the virus properly hits the regions, things are only likely to get uglier.There you have lack of protective clothing and equipment on one hand, and lack of expertise and organisational capacity on another, he said. Add in the secrecy of provincial Russia as you move away from Moscow, and you have all the ingredients for a perfect storm.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

starting towards the end of the month.The Government will formally review the lockdown measures on Thursday, May .Yet, it is expected that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will only reveal in the daily coronavirus press briefing that the lockdown will be extended once again.Instead, Mr Johnson will announce further details including the exit plan in a speech on Sunday, May .Appearing at his first press conference since his own fight with the deadly illness, the PM said Britain is now past the peak of the virus and revealed an exit plan will be unveiled.He said: We will be setting out comprehensive plans next week to explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, and how we can travel to work and make le in the workplace safe.Mr Johnson said Britain must keep going for now - and prepared to extend the shutdown into June.This is despite economic pressures as the UK face their worst slump in history.But Mr Johnson says he believes Britain will come charging back once the lockdown is over.Dominic Raab, who stood in for the Prime Minister when Mr Johnson was hospitalised with coronavirus, extended the initial three-week lockdown on Thursday, April .Brits will all be eager to hear what the Government has to say regarding the lockdown when they review the current measures.Among those high on the list will be whether the restrictions will be relaxed - with Boris Johnson stating in Wednesdays Prime Minister Questions that some rule changes could be put in place for Monday, May .Heres what could be covered during the speech on Sunday, May :Boris Johnson has ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.All Brits must comply with these measures.The police have been given the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings.Cops can issue on-the-spot fines of £ for meeting without good reason.The fine can be halved to £paid swtly and repeat offenders will be hit by a doubling of the fine each time.Brits have not had as many restrictions enforced upon them as many other European countries.Citizens required special permits to be allowed to leave their houses in Spain, France, Italy, and Germany, although restrictions are being eased across Europe.But Germans face having toto tighter lockdown restrictions after a rise in cases.On  March, , Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling Brits to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.Lockdown restrictions could last until June, while social distancing rules are expected to remain in place beyond that.But some measures could yet be tightened in areas where infections are rising under a whack-a-mole strategy.The new plans could lead to even stricter restrictions being imposed on areas such as care homes, prisons or whole towns.Michael Gove confirmed this approach on Sunday, May , telling the daily coronavirus briefing at No: “It is important that we make clear that any approach we take is staged.And although Mr Johnson wants the country to fall into step, with restrictions being lted gradually at the same pace nationwide, officials in Scotland and Ireland have started to unveil their strategies.Ireland has announced it will begin easing restrictions on May .Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin the first of five phases in late May.The easing will begin with small social gatherings, funerals and outdoor activities.By August the Irish will be able to go to pubs and small festivals again.The key part of the plan is social distancing, which will be implemented throughout each of the stages.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has readied residents for another month of lockdown.Ms Sturgeon said: “I have to be straight with you, it may very well be too early, even this time next week, in any meaningful way, to safely lt any of the current restrictions.”And Boris Johnson wants Britain to be back at work from Tuesday, May  - as long as coronavirus cases are low enough.But worried Brits dont want the lockdown lted yet, with fewer than one in five supporting the reopening of schools, restaurants, stadiums and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"pub beer gardens social distance coronavirus","story":"Professor Robert Dingwall has said it is time to relax the strict lockdown rules that came in force on March .He told BBC Radio s Today programme on Friday: If it is a sunny weekend afternoon and the pub has a garden and the landlords are prepared to accept responsibility for not overcrowding that garden, I see no particular reason why it should not reopen.The sociologist, who is a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, also claimed the two-metre social distancing rule was conjured up out of nowhere.He said: Theres never been a scientic basis for two metres, its kind of a rule of thumb. But its not like there is …rigorous scientic literature that it is founded upon.The UK went into lockdown in March as clubs and bars were ordered to shut until the foreseeable future.Police were used to enforce the shutdown as they were granted power under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act  in order revoke operating licences for dferent types of venuesthey werent following the Governments measures.Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered all pubs, clubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and sport centres to shut as soon as they reasonably can and not to reopen - as hundreds were seen across the country sinking their final pints.Last week it emerged that pubs would be the last to reopen.a government source claimed to the Daily Mail that one plan is to lt the lockdown in phases.Under the possible plans, outdoor spaces would be opened first while pubs would be last.The best case scenario could see restrictions eased for non-essential shops from early to mid-May.The guidelines could again be relaxed by June and July - allowing for pubs and restaurants to reopen  by the end of summer.There has been growing pressure on the government to outline its plan, with economic paralysis wreaking havoc on jobs and businesses.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done. Sit-ups.He may not be Emily Maitlis , but he’s the irrepressible and lucky optimist telling us to get off our fat a***s when we need to hear it most.He’s temporarily indisposed at the moment, of course.A gammy arm means we Rosie is leading the workouts.But I was firmly of the opinion nothing and no one could ever stand in the way of world domination, until I tuned into Sunday night’s Diva On Lockdown and there was Gemma Collins trying to contort her mighty bulk into one of Joe’s squats while she bellowed: “I wonder how Joe Wicks would feelhe knew the GC was doing his workout ”Beaten, I’d imagine.He must never know.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.And her face is glued to the back of her head.So there will be hell to payit comes unstuck on The Real Marigold Hotel, where the only other one of the eight celebs who’s appeared looking as unearthly as Britt is former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, whose hair is now a “vibrant and colourful” shade of roast papaya orange.

But Henry was a great player, so don’t make me choose between them.”Paul Merson: “The secret to working hard is to work hard.”ON one particularly fraught episode of her Channel  show, last week, Steph McGovern was forced to let a wasp out of her living room window, live on air.Probably halving her audience in the process.A day later it was announced the show itself was being released back into the wild, or as they put it “taking a break”.Credit for this development was being given to Steph’s long-suffering neighbours, who’d objected to the disruption the production had caused and may yet get a Bafta fellowship for their intervention.Truth be told, though, Steph’s “power hour of positivity” was more likely killed by worthiness, lack of content, technical issues and the host herself, who’s a rotten interviewer, kills every good joke stone dead, has the same set response to everythingand a terrible habit of asking exactly the wrong question.“Martin , what are you doing with all that toilet paper ” “Errr . . . ”There’s talk of a brave new dawn, in a shiny Leeds studio, later this year and when I last checked, author Marian Keyes was giving some pointed advice on how to become a good novelist: “Your first efforts will be woefully appalling.

Our formerly thriving economy is on its knees, losing billions a day. Huge numbers of jobs have been lost, many permanently.Matt Hancock’s new “track and trace” app may prove a great addition to the armoury against Covid- and we urge every Sun reader to download and use it when available. But we cannot wait for such tactics to bear fruit in the statistics.We are past the peak. Deaths are on their way down. The NHS was nowhere near being overwhelmed and that looks increasingly unlikely.The Government must not be swayed by the lockdown’s continued public support. That will evaporate once the long-term economic consequences sink in.We strongly disagree, though, with those who never thought it necessary — and make spurious comparisons of our death totals against countries of very dferent sizes and population densities.And we know what a tough call this is. But easing us imminently back to work and school, using social distancing and masks, is the right one. Yes, an NHS unable to cope would be a catastrophe.An even greater one is a prolonged lockdown . . . and a nation engulfed by bankruptcies, unemployment and poverty.WHAT a golden excuse the lockdown has been for every bossy busybody to exercise their authoritarian urges.Even so, we never imagined anyone would be mean-spirited enough to moan about the weekly clap for our ­carers — let alone for local councils to act on such petty grievances.One, however, has issued a warning to tone down the applause and Vera Lynn songs after a single complaint. Another has told a barman his sponsored singalong after the pm clap is too noisy.Do officials simply lack the backbone to tell these whingers to lump it Or do they actively enjoy sealing off ­avenues of pleasure EVEN in these grim times one announcement yesterday was too much to bear:“We have tried to make Love Island this summer, but it’s just not possible.”Our hearts are broken.What will we talk about now When will the Queen again address her disheartened nation Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If Boris Johnson is to get our flatlining economy going again, he and his Government must prove to the public that lockdown restrictions can be lted sensibly and safely.And that’s where homemade masks come in. Yes, we know they’re not perfect. But mounting evidence proves that insisting on their use in confined spaces can help slow the spread of the virus, and — crucially — they lend confidence.One way or another, it’s becoming crystal clear that after lockdown Britain will be very dferent from the country we remember. Gone are the days of a post-work pint in the pub to wind down:ministers permit us to socialise, it will be only for picnics, and only with those we consider our close friends.But with the economy on its knees, we must throw everything we’ve got at creating a “new normal” to tide us over until a vaccine can be found.Andmasks are part of that, then let’s get Britain sewing.OFFICIALS must stop hiding behind corona-jargon and start explaining in plain English exactly what they want from us.Guidance states thatyou’re classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” you’re supposed to “shield”, andyou’re considered “clinically vulnerable” you should be “closely following social distancing rules”.The problem is thatyou’re over  and not in the habit of scrutinising government websites, you may understandably not know what the dference between those terms is. And so could be putting yourself through the misery of a  week self-isolation unnecessarily.Brits have given up most of their cherished liberties at the drop of a hat.

Currently people are only allowed to go out for one form a day.Friends and family will be allowed to have park picnics and sit on benches -they keep two metres apart. The move will let them get together on the grass without fear of being harassed, stared at or moved on.The measures could also come into effect next week, possibly as early as Monday.The Government is also looking at allowing people to play non-contact sports such as golf and tennis.A senior source told The Sun: “The PM wants people to know that all the effort they’ve put in is delivering progress, that six weeks of doing nothing has been worthwhile.“So we can now let off the brake a bit, and see what happens.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on.

No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent + .When later asked about how the baby was doing, Musk told one curious fan X Æ A- was happy, healthy  cute as a button, followed by a smiley face.The bizarre name revelation came after the Tesla CEO, , posted a cute snap of their sleeping baby using a face tattoo filter, as well as one of him cradling the newborn at the hospital on Twitter.The South African tech mogul, who has five sons from his previous marriage, could be seen cuddling his infant son, who was swaddled in blankets.Earlier, when Elons followers pressed him for a name, he had apparently joked that the newborn is called X Æ A- Musk, which Grimes seemed to confirm.The name, which may be pronounced X-Ash-A, appeared to be partially inspired by one of the songs from her last album - ÆM.Grimes gave birth to their baby on Monday, with Elon announcing that mom and baby are all good.The Canadian native announced she was pregnant back in January with a photo in which a baby appeared to be superimposed on her stomach.She wrote: I thought about censoring them [her nipples] for a hot minute hahabut the photo is so much less feral without the nipples.Plus being knocked up is a very feral  war-like state of being. Might as well be what it is.It is Grimes first child, while Musk already has five children of his own - Nevada, Grfin, Kai, Xavier, Saxon, and Damien.The birth of their son coincides with Musk announcing in a series of bizarre tweets on Friday he would sell almost all of his physical possessions and will own no house.He admitted to his  million followers that Grimes is mad at him for selling off his stuff while she gives birth to their first child together.Elon - who has taken a pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis - appeared to send a caveat about the second home to future buyers on Twitter.Just one stipulation on sale: I own Gene Wilders old house.

If China can do it we can.The Government is trialling a contact tracing app in the Isle of Wight, with plans to roll it out to the rest of the country.Professor Pennington said the UK should have focused on tracing new cases from the start of the outbreak.He said: I would give the UK and Scottish governments five out of ten over the way they have handled this.The big mistake was on March  when they decided the policy was to just flatten the curve and give up mass testing and contact tracing.The policy was taken, it seems to me, because of a lack of testing capacity and it was wrong. I think it was a bad policy judgement.They could have used university labs, more NHS labs and others much sooner.Professor Pennington said the levels of new cases in the UK needed to be ten times lower to make a meaningful dference.Yesterday there were , new cases of the virus - but the Government has been quick to explain case numbers are higher because of higher numbers of testing.Professor Pennington said: At the moment we are past the peak, but not on a signicantly downward trend, the virus is at a sort of a plateau just below the peak.He said one of the biggest problems facing the UK over the next few months would be people coming into the country.Heathrow Airport are currently trialing thermal imaging cameras to check passengers for coronavirus.Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said yesterday the UK needed to work on an international common standard of coronavirus screening to allow the aviation sector to get back on its feet - and to keep new cases out.But Professor Pennington was not convinced screening measures were enough.He said: I am sceptical this will work well enough because you will miss half of those infected because of theperiod of the virus when people may not be showing symptoms.And he added: We also cant wait for a vaccine. We dont knowwe will get a successful vaccine and anybody who says we will is wrong.We are quite a long way from getting thisreally under control.

such as encouraging more people back to work now or opening beer gardens or encouraging more use of public transport - would not, in my judgement, be safe for us to make yet.And I believe that for us to drop the clear, well understood ‘Stay at Home’ message right now could be a potentially catastrophic mistake.The Sun earlier revealed Brits will be set free to enjoy unlimited exercise from Monday.Cafes could re-open and outdoor spaces soon after, and park picnics may also be on again, as long as people stay two metres apart.It comes as Boris Johnson was tipped to ditch Britains Stay at Home message as he prepares to ease the UKs lockdown measures next week.The PM will address the nation on Sunday with a roadmap for how to tweak the current lockdown measures, some of which may come into effect the very next day.The news came as:The Scottish leader insisted all the evidence pointed towards having to continue with the same rules.She explained: “Our assessment of the evidence leads me to conclude that the lockdown must be extended at this stage.“We know that progress remains fragile, our estimates suggest there are still signicant amounts of people in Scotland infected with this virus.Any signicant easing of restrictions at this stage would be very very risky indeed.The PM will meet with Sturgeon and the other devolved administration leaders later this afternoon.Ahead of the meeting, the SNP leader insisted she will not be pressured into lting restrictions early.She said: If the PM wants to decide to move at a faster rate than Scotland that is his right.I hope you understand and agree that I must make judgements informed by the evidence that are right and safe for Scotland.I will not be pressured into lting restrictions prematurely. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" "},{"url":null,"title":"hayfever may be in the mind","story":"A new study found that some people suffer from allergic reactions even when there is no pollen in the air and that they could in fact be having placebo responses.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the US, suggests that someones symptoms might be caused by being in a place where they have previously been exposed to pollen.Dr Luciana Besedovsky, from Hard Medical School and the University of Tübingen, said an allergic response can be triggered even in the absence of allergens by simply reencountering the environmental context in which an allergen was previously administered.For the study, researchers recruited  men and administered triggers such as birch pollen and grass - all common allergies for people who suffer from hayfever - through a nasal spray.To determine whether their reactions were genuine or in fact part of a placebo effect, the group were asked toand carry out the experiment again.However, this time they were given a harmless nasal spray of salt water, but were told that there was a  per cent chance that it contained pollen.For some, simply being in the same room where they had originally been exposed to pollen did spur a reaction.Experts noted a rise in an enzyme known as tryptase, which is produced at a higher level during hay fever as the immune system kicks in.They then wanted to test whether a similar reaction could be triggered by a smell.The group were asked to snf an almond-scented chemical before being blasted with pollen.Scientists then asked them to repeat the experiment again at a later stage and noted that the scent triggered mild hay fever symptoms, such as sneezing, in some - even though there was no pollen around anymore.Dr Besedovsky, first author of the study, said: Our findings suggestsomeone goes to a place where they usually have hayfever, like a park with lots of trees, they might have an allergic reaction.This might happen outside of pollen season because they have been mentally conditioned to associate that park with hayfever.She added that while she is not claiming that people with hayfever make up the condition, it’s clear that there is a clear link between how the immune system responds to certain cues from the body.The academic also suspected that sleep may help people store a memory which links an allergic reaction to a place.To test this theory, half of the participants were asked to stay awake all night after the first experiment.For those who had a good nights sleep, their tryptase levels only rose the second time after originally being exposed to the pollen.However, most of the group had a rise in the enzyme when smelling the almond-scented chemical - regardless of whether or not they had slept.Dr Besedovsky said: These findings have important implications for understanding the often observed placebo allergic responses occurring in the absence of allergens.In conclusion to her findings, she said that sleep may actually be a contributor to the aggregation of allergies.All participants enrolled in the test were not found to have any sleep disturbances before they began the trial.She stated that people may have been mentally conditioned to associate a park with hayfever, therefore spurring on symptoms.In the UK, around  million people are affected by hay fever with the pollen seasons typically kicking off in late March or early April.The pollen count for this week across most of the county is at a moderate level, except in the north and Scotland where some areas will see high pollen concentrations.Meanwhile, as the coronavirus pandemic in the UK continues, hayfever sufferers have also been growing concerned about their symptoms, some of which can be mistaken for the virus.The two main symptoms of coronavirus are a high fever and a new continuous cough, whereas people suffering with hayfever will not have a high temperature and will not usually have aches and pains, another symptom of the virus.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

During his time as the partyaposs Brexit spokesperson and in the leadership campaign Mr Starmer was reluctant to criticise Mr Corbyn - who remained extremely popular among the partyaposs membership.But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Starmer, who won the leadership on a landslide, said Mr Corbyn was the main issue which came up when he went to more than  constituencies where he knocked on doors and spoke to campaign teams.“The topic of conversation was always what was coming up . . . anybody who knocks on doors knows a number of things came up,” he said. “The leadership of Labour party was number one, fair or unfair,” Sir Keir told the FT Magazine.Mr Starmer said the partyaposs programme for government was also an issue with voters turned off by the “overload” of Labour’s manesto. This was a common complaint at the time with many MPs who said that the electorate saw the plan - which included proposals to nationalise several industries, hand £bn of shares to workers, and plans for an extra £bn a year of tax and spending - was unworkable.  “People thought there was too much in it and because there was too much in it they didn’t believe any of it,” Mr Starmer told the FT.  Mr Starmer has already distanced himself from the previous administration by sacking a number of those close to Jeremy Corbyn including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett and instead promoting those on the so-called soft left.

Hundreds of people are still dying each day from coronavirus. But now that weaposre past the peak, Boris Johnson will lay out a roadmap on Sunday  May for how lockdown will be eased. He will change very little immediately - and wonapost end lockdown in one go. But some changes will take effect from Monday  Maypossible. And in the long term, his plan will give us a clearer picture of what the UK will look like over the coming months in a new, coronavirus-scarred world. The Mirror understands a draft -page plan has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. The Governmentaposs blueprint aims to to relax the lockdown in staggered steps between now and October.  Schools and outdoor activities are set to resume within weeks, while pubs and restaurants look doomed to stay closed for months. Meanwhile the furlough scheme will be wound down after June, fines for breaching lockdown will rise, and you could be told to cover your face in public. So what will reopen, what will stay shut - and how will your everyday le change  Weaposve explained the timeline and all the main proposals below.for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead.When will lockdown end  The Prime Minister will lay out his roadmap for ending lockdown on Sunday  May. He will give an address to the nation at pm, with more details and a Parliamentary statement to follow on Monday. Some measures will be lted as early as Monday  Maywe possibly can. But lockdown will not end all in one go. Immediate measures on Monday are likely to be only very minor and we donapost know yet what theyaposll be. Experts say some closures or social distancing will last until , when weaposre likely to have a vaccine. Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus. Meanwhile, the legal date to review the lockdown is Thursday  May. That review will keep restrictions in place - but no detail will be announced on that day.  Will we be given specic dates  This seems unlikely. The Irish government has spelt out five phases each with a target date between May and August. But while Downing Street hasnapost denied using phases, they probably wonapost have a specic date. Instead Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.”  What are the proposed dates  According to a draft plan seen by the Mirror, from the start of June, primary schools in England would have a phased . Households could also be allowed to expand their “social bubble” to one other household of family or friends. At the end of June, secondary schools would , some outdoor activities and cafes. Then, pubs and restaurants could reopen at the end of August or early September. The final stage of lting restrictions, which could include the opening of gyms and and theof fans to Premier League matches, is the least predictable. Earmarked for October, it is being fiercely debated, amid fears of a second wave of Covid- or a flu outbreak. The Sun reports gyms face being closed for most of , while playgrounds are also poised to stay shut. . From Monday Unlimited exercise allowed. Employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open through- out the lockdownsafe. Garden centres could reopen while there may be more guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. . End of May Start of June Phasedof primary schools in England, starting with Year . Households could be allowed to expand “social bubble” to meet one other household of family or friends. . JunePhasedof secondary schools in England before the summer holidays. Small team sports such as five-a-side football could be allowed, along with outdoor gatherings of fewer than  people. Cafes with outdoor seating could reopen while outdoor sports like golf, tennis and angling might resume. Possibleof Premier League matches, although behind closed doors. . End of August Start of September Pubs, bars and restaurants could gradually reopen although customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules. . October Possibleof football fans to matches. Gyms could be allowed to re-open. But any further lting of restrictions to get back to normal le would be in doubt amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus or an outbreak of seasonal flu. What will the roadmap talk about  It will spell out how the lockdown changes in phases over time. It may have a traffic light system spelling out what you can and canapost do as restrictions lt. The plan would also drop the governmentaposs stay at home branding in favour of a more subtle message. But it will also make clear that the UK is not ing to business as usual. Some restrictions will be eased, but others - like fines for breaches - will be made harsher than they are now. While people are put back on public transport and in some workplaces, there will be strict social distancing to keep people two metres apart. People are likely to be advised to cover their faces, and will be told to use an NHS phone app that alerts youyouaposve come into close contact with the virus.  How does the R number, apostest, track and traceapos and five tests come into all this  The aposRapos number is the average number of people infected by each Covid- carrier. It has to be low enough for each stage of the roadmap to begin. Currently R is between . and . because so many people are out of contact with each other. Every time you relax a lockdown rule, R rises again. Ministers say they wonapost do anything that pushes the R number back above . The UK must also pass five tests before easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSTo help pass all these tests there is a apostest, track and traceapos strategy planned for launch at the middle of May. It will mean downloading an NHS app which tells youyouaposve been near a Covid- carrier - and ensuring you isolate quicklyyouaposre put at risk to stop it spreading further. More on this below. So what will the plan say   Schools Schools will reopen in a phased way - with some year groups likely to go back first while others are told to remain at home. Boris Johnson has signalled he wants primary schools to be the first to , and it is likely that Year  will be the first to . Years  and  would then be the first back in secondary schools, according to one plan. Priority could also be put on pupils with special educational needs. Teachers need time to put social distancing in place, including reorganising classrooms to keep children  metres apart. Sources suggest this will begin as early as June . No declined to sayall pupils will be back before September. Universities Arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn, according to the Sunday Times. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus.  Public transport The number of trains will slowly rise as lockdown eases, to avoid overcrowding. Hand sanitiser and one-way systems would be placed on the network, with spacing at s and bus stops “clearly marked out” to keep people two metres apart. New timetables will be introduced as planned in May, even though trains will not run to them straight away. Firms would be urged to stagger workersapos start times to spread out the rush out. But London mayor Sadiq Khan has warned capacity could be overwhelmed. A double decker London bus would have to have just  passengers. Meanwhile the government has hinted at more support for Cycle to Work, a tax break scheme where you can buy a bicycle over a year through your employer.  Workplaces and working from home Workplaces would have floor markings to ensure people are two metres apart, according leaked draft guidance. The guidance could also recommend staggered arrival times and breaks, fewer people in lts and regular deep cleaning. According to BuzzFeed News, other draft measures for workplaces include:Providing additional parking or bike racks Having more entrances into the workplace Alternatives to touch-based security devices such as keypads Washing unorms on site rather than at home Reducing maximum occupancy for lts, providing hand sanitiser for the operation of lts and encouraging use of stairs Introducing more one-way flow routes through buildings Reviewing layouts to allow staff to work further apart from each otherBut workers would in some cases be allowed to sit less than two metres apart - despite the risk being  to  times higher at one metre than two metres. Not all workers would go back to the officethey donapost need to. Government advisors have previously said working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine for coronavirus.The furlough scheme At the moment, .m workers are having their wages paid by the state - up to % or £, a month. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned this is not sustainable because it costs as much as the NHS. The furlough scheme runs in full up to the end of June and will then be wound down. Officials appear to be looking at cutting the amount to workers and the self-employed or limiting it only to certain sectors. This has sparked fears some will lose out. The future of the furlough scheme wonapost be announced on Sunday. Sources said it would be in the week or two weeks after the PMaposs address on Sunday. Picnics, golf course, tennis and going outdoors People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, drive to the countryside and have picnics, according to the Mail on Sunday. And the Daily Mail claims golf courses, tennis courts and fishing lakes will reopen from June too. Youaposd still have to be with members of your own household only, and keep two metres away from other groups.  No has not confirmed these reports. But ministers and scientists have repeatedly said outdoor activities are less risky than those indoors - indicating theyaposll be the first to be allowed back.  Supermarkets Supermarkets would doubtless keep many of the social distancing measures theyaposve already put in place. And opening hours could be increased on Sunday to reduce overcrowding. Boris Johnson has said heaposs looking at relaxing Sunday trading laws to reduce queues on the weekend.  Building sites Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers. So the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said because the risk of the virus outdoors is lower than indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs outside. He added: “Thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.”  aposBubblesapos of up to  people People could meet small bubbles of their friends and family under one idea to ease the coronavirus lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions on peopleaposs movement in the future. But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. Reports later said the idea was one being mulled by the UK government. But itaposs not set in stone.  Fines for breaching lockdown The government is considering raising the penalty for defying lockdown from £ to £ for a first offence. The fines would then double for each offence after that, just as they do already. And the maximum fine would rise from just under £, at the moment to £,. A senior government source did not deny these figures, reported by the Sunday , were under consideration. Covering your face The government hasnapost made a final decision on whether to ask people to cover their face in public. However, some kind of face covering advice is widely expected after Boris Johnson covering oneaposs face in some situations would be a useful tool. Itaposs understood thatface coverings are required, they wonapost be masks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended. And the government would provide guidance on what kind of material you can make such a covering from. Itaposs important that people donapost end up fiddling with their face covering in a way that means theyaposre actually creating more risk, by continually touching their face.  Using a new app A new contact tracing app is expected to launch in around mid-May after trials on the Isle of Wight this week. The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus. It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselvesnecessary. It is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed. The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation. For it to work properly, at least % or so of the population need to download it. It will be paired with an army of , human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.  Arriving in the UK Ministers are actively looking at quarantining people who arrive into the UK once lockdown begins to ease. Nothing is confirmed, but reports have suggested people will be asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. If so, this would be a major blow to the airline industry and render most holidays to Britain pointless. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: I think it’s important... that we ensure the sacrices in the sense of social distancing that we’re asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. So I am actively looking at these issues right now. So that when we have infection rates within the country under control, weaposre not importing. Local lockdowns The government is considering new wave of local lockdown restrictions later this year to stop new spikes of coronavirus in their tracks. At the moment, officials are focused on easing the lockdown at the same pace across the UK - to move as one nation in the Covid- crisis. But itaposs understood officials are looking at changing that approachthere is a rapid new second outbreak of the virus, which needs quick action to be halted. A government source said: If you were to see worrying increases of transmission happening in regions, then you would want to move quickly to try and stop those.  Pubs, grassroots sport, mass gatherings and other venues Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. Likewise, ministers have indicated that mass gatherings will be among the last things to reopen. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.” And Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the No coronavirus update: “Transmission is signicantly less outdoors than indoors.” Meanwhile hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Courts Courts might have to use two courtrooms where we would have used one in the past, so that jurors can retire into a safe space and also be spaced out and distanced within the court. People are also measuring courtrooms - often a cramped environment - to work out what would be safe. And the number of people on juries could be reduced. A aposone UKapos approach Scotland and Wales have repeatedly set out plans ahead of, or slightly dferently to, the rest of the UK government. And itaposs true that the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over areas like schools and care homes. However, ministers have also stressed they want to keep the whole of the UK moving in the same way at the same time. And the government has distanced itself from claims that worst-hit regions, like London and the West Midlands, could have dferent rules to the countryside. NHS services Some routine operations and fertility treatment have already been restored as hospital inpatients fall for several weeks in a row. However, itaposs not yet clear when other services - including ENT therapies and dentistry, where staff are particularly at risk of transmission - will continue.

Under pressure the floundering Prime Minister conceded that the death rates in care homes was a matter of “bitter regret” and lack of protective kit was “enraging.” The Labour leader’s precision and seriousness contrasted with a Tory leader trying to busk his way through the greatest challenge to face Britain since the Second World War. It is no good Mr Johnson sharing the public’s frustration at the failure to protect the elderly or provide frontline workers with PPE. It is his responsibility to recty this. Yet again the Government’s response to criticism was to make a promise they will struggle to keep. Yesterday Mr Johnson announced an ambition of , tests a day by the end of this month. Shortly afterwards it emerged that the Government has missed its target of , daily tests for the third day in a row. It is time to end the showboating and to focus on delivering the tests and kit that will save lives and help to end the lockdown. Saving shops  Even before Covid- struck our high streets were facing a tough time. Their plight has been made even worse by the pandemic with many shops and local businesses now fearing for their survival. Which is why we should welcome any initiative that could help the retail sector.

MPs heard today that the slump in air travel means Heathrow’s third runway might not be needed for another  to  years. With flights down %, airport boss John Holland-Kaye told the Transport Select Committee progress on the project would depend on “how things turn out over the next few years”. to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at  www.mirror emailGatwick Airport’s future also looks in doubt as Virgin Atlantic and British Airways announced plans to reduce activity there. Ministers are encouraging stay-cations, but it is not clearjourneys to areas such as the Lake District, Cornwall or Devon will be permitted by July and August. Cumbria’s director of public health Colin Cox has said there was a risk of a second wave of infections as lockdown in the Lakes was “fraying at the edges”.Hotels, caravan parks and BBs are all still shut, and in a recent Downing Street press conference, a business owner in Cornwall asked Boris Johnson how tourism would be managed.He said: “We have to get your business going again, to get tourism going again. “But we can’t allow such a big influx of tourists as to create a second spike, a second wave of the disease.”Cabinet Minister Michael Gove told MPs that “at the moment and for some time to come” people should not travel to visit popular seaside resorts.Some UK hotels might stay shut for a yearthey cannot open for summer. Patricia Yates, of Visit Britain, warned that for many hotels it would not be worth openingthey were restricted to less than % capacity due to social distancing measures. She said: “The normal pattern is businesses make their money in July and August then make do for the rest of the year. Lots of businesses are sayingthey miss the summer then they will stay closed.” It has emerged that other countries have struck up informal agreements so their citizens can travel over the school holidays. Germany and Italy have both announced their citizens should be able to have summer breaks abroad. An alliance has been created between Australia, Austria, Israel, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece and New Zealand to make travel between them easier. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: “Our nations reacted early and forcefully, and now we’re in a better place.” In Spain, the Balearic Islands’ tourism minister Iago Negueruela singled out Britain for its response to the virus, suggesting it had handicapped chances of holidays in Ibiza, Majorca or Menorca. He said: “There are countries like the United Kingdom that have taken too long to adopt containment measures. “That puts us in a dferent situation with respect to them.” Balearics President Francina Armengol has asked the EU to set up a “homogeneous framework across the continent to guarantee the safe recovery of air activity”. German tourism commissioner Thomas Bareiss said citizens should be able to travel to neighbouring countries “that can be reached by car”, such as Holland, Austria, France, Poland and Belgium. He said: “I would not yet write off other regions in Europe, such as the Balearic Islands or the Greek islands. “I hope that, given the good numbers, we will be able to relax the restrictions in four to eight weeks.” Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia will open their borders to each others’ citizens from May . Lithuania’s PM Saulius Skvernlis said: “All three Baltic states have properly contained the spread of the coronavirus, and we trust each others’ health systems.” Travel between Britain and France by ferry or Eurotunnel is ing, but people must prove they have a family or professional reason for crossing the Channel or they live permanently in France to continue the journey on the other side. This is expected to continue for some time yet after President Emmanuel Macron warned his citizens that it was “too soon to say whether we can take holidays”.

The French Army has denied any of its athletes were contaminated at the event held in Wuhan, China, which has since been declared as the epicentre of the pandemic. Reacting to the revelations from numerous French athletes that they ed from the World Military Games with a mystery illness, the French Ministry of the Armed Forces told the countryaposs media as the epidemic linked to Covid- was not known at the time. They added that the French delegation, made up of  people including  athletes benefited from medical checks before and during the games with a dedicated medical team made up of about  people. It said there were declared cases with the army health service of flu or of hospitalisations during or after ing from the games that could be linked, to cases of covid-.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening.   Athletes at the World Military Games in coronavirus epicentre Wuhan last October have also been quoted in French media as speculating that they may have brought the virus back home with them. This revelation came after it was discovered that a Frenchman, Amirouche Hammar, , had been infected with the coronavirus in the Paris region as early as December . French media reported that investigations into the origins of the coronavirus revealed there is a possibility it emerged in Wuhan as early as October  when the games took place. A French delegation took part in the th edition of the World Military Games in Wuhan from October  to  - just  days before the first Chinese person officially became ill with coronavirus. There were more than , athletes from all over the world taking part. According to French news channel BFMTV, a number of athletes ed to France with unusual symptoms, including fevers and body aches. The news channel says none of the ing athletes were tested and the French Army, who were responsible for organising their athletes at the military games, reportedly confirmed that they had not wanted to test any athletes either. BFMTV quotes one athlete, who preferred to remain anonymous, as saying that he originally thought he had simply caught a cold.  However, when news began to emerge of an epidemic in Wuhan, many athletes on a WhatsApp group reportedly began to openly wonderit was possible that they had contracted the disease too. Now that it has been revealed that Amirouche Hammar in France had the coronavirus back in December, closer attention is being paid to what these athletes have said. Local media notes that Elodie Clouvel, a world champion modern pentathlete, was asked on local TV channel Television Loire  on March ,she was worried about the prospect of potentially having to spend the summer in Japan for the Olympics. She replied: No because I think that with Velentin [her partner] we have already had the coronavirus, well the covid-. The -year-old added: We were in Wuhan for the World Military Games at the end of October. And afterwards, we all fell ill. Valentin missed three days of training. Me, I was sick too. I had things I had never had before. We werenapost particularly worried because no one was talking about it yet.  She added: A lot of athletes at the World Military Games were very ill. We were recently in touch with a military doctor who told us: aposI think you had it because a lot of people from this delegation were ill.apos Local media report that since she spoke up on March , many athletes have been asked not to answer questions from journalists and to refer media enquiries to the head of communication of the French armies. According to French media, athletes who were in Wuhan reportedly received telephone calls from the army a few weeks ago to reassure them. One of these athletes, who remains anonymous, is quoted as saying: We were told, there is no risk, you left on October , and the virus arrived on November . French media report that sick athletes were also noted in some other delegations, including the Swedish delegation, with people ing to Sweden with strong fevers. But some athletes are sceptical, with Aloise Ratornaz, silver medallist in sailing, telling Ouest-France: I do not think there were any signicant risks of being infected. We lived in isolation during these world games. We had a whole village just for the athletes. She added: We had a restaurant for the athletes where all the food was completely filtered, controlled, in a completely sanitised atmosphere. Professor Eric Caumes, an infectious and tropical disease specialist at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris, said the theory that athletes participating in the World Military Games in Wuhan were contaminated with covid- is completely plausible. Despite the French army strenuously contesting the allegations, prof Caumes has subsequently been quoted in French media as saying that the characteristics of the illness and the symptoms that have been described by the athletes make one think that it is covid-. Caumes added: You saw that in France, we had our first official case end January. Then a few days ago, we realised that the first French case actually appeared at the end of December at the Bondy hospital. And we will no doubt find other cases from December. So Iaposm not very surprised that exactly the same thing happened in Wuhan.

According to the Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transportfound more than four in fiveresponding English councils had plans to open some dumps. About % of local authorities planning to have household waste and recycling centres open this week and a further % expected to reopen sites by May , the survey conducted last week reveals. Many household recycling and waste centres were closed when the country went into lockdown, due to dficulties with social distancing and so councils could concentrate staff and resources on bin collections. But closure of tips and curbs on some collections, along with more waste being generated by people embarking on spring clean clear-outs, DIY projects and gardening, has raised concerns over an increase in fly-tipping.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereThis week, the Government published updated guidance encouraging local authorities to reopen their centressocial distancing measures can be put in place and staff and visitors can be kept safe. Householders are being told they should only take rubbish to a household waste and recycling centreit cannot be stored safely at home and no alternatives for disposing of it, such as bulky waste collections, are available. David Renard, environment spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: Councils are keen to open household waste and recycling centres as soon as practicable. The decision to reopen sites will be taken by inidual councils based on risk assessments in their area. This will be a gradual process over the next few weeks and based on whether they have enough staff, social distancing measures are in place to protect workers and members of the public, and waste staff are given personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection and provide reassurance. Last week, Waste facilities in Manchester opened for the first time in weeks - with huge queues of drivers waiting to dump rubbish. It follows a surge in flytipping since Brits were told they must stay at home. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has said councils should be confident to reopen tips as soon as possible - although there have been warnings that protective equipment for waste workers needs to be provided.  At the waste centre on Reliance Street in Manchester a queue of cars was already waiting by .am, half an hour before it was scheduled to open. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: While we are reopening centres, this is not ato normal. We would ask the public to limit their journeys and only travel to a household waste and recycling centreit is absolutely essential to do so.

The top  will be part of a final exhibition which will be released digitally at first and potentially become a physical exhibition in the future. Kate, , is a confident and skilled photographer, regularly releasing her own photographs to mark her children’s birthdays in recent years. A senior palace source said: “The Duchess has been inspired by many of the amazing feats accomplished by so many people that have brought Britain together. “The aim of the project is to bring together an unofficial national archive of the crisis, what has touched our everyday lives, the heroes behind the stories and images. “The Duchess’s choices merely act as inspiration for the categories – anyone can enter and the aim is to get as many people involved as possible. “The hope is it will create a unique photographic portrait of the people of our nation as we hold still for the good of others, and celebrate those who have continued so we can stay safe.” Kensington Palace said the aim was to “capture the spirit, the mood, the hopes, the fears and the feelings of the nation as we continue to deal with the outbreak”.

A tweet accompanied with a funny g of a cat begging said: I want to join this book club! Sign me up. Iaposve been reading rubbish books anyway. Gimmie gimmie.

But now she uses her psychic abilities to give advice to the rich and famous. When Claire Stone’s phone buzzes with a message from model Tanya Bardsley or TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, she’s not surprised. Her contacts list is packed with stars from The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and The Only Way Is Essex. They rely on Claire to provide them with psychic readings and answers to their le ­questions. And when she’s not helping celebrities with their burning issues, Claire is teaching others how to ­connect with spirit guides through her workshops and courses. It’s a far cry from the poverty and uncertainty the -year-old faced when she grew up in Merseyside. From the age of two she lived with her mother and grandparents, after her dad left. Her grandparents died in her early teens, and when her mum became unwell Claire ended up becoming a young carer for her two-year-old twin sisters. “When I was  I was left to raise my sisters,” says Claire, who still lives in St Helens, Merseyside, with her husband John and daughters who are  and eight. “I was out of school looking after them. But I also had agoraphobia, which meant I struggled to go outside. “Sometimes social services would bring us beans and sacks of spuds, but I really think we slipped through the net.” Despite her mental health problems and unstable home le, Claire did have one thing she could rely on – her gt of talking to angels. “I’ve always been able to see angels but it wasn’t until I was about six that I realised my cousins didn’t have the same experiences as me,” reveals Claire. But her family were strict Christians who attended church every week.  “The vicar would say it was the devil’s work,” says Claire. As she grew older she struggled mentally. “I thought I was cursed because I had such a hideous le.” It was then, Claire says, she started to connect with an angel called Archangel Ariel. Ariel would come to Claire at night and she would hear her voice as a thought. “She started telling me how to cure my anxiety,” says Claire.

People have been ordered to stay in their homes unless they are shopping for groceries, exercising, helping a vulnerable person or going to work . All non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, with pubs, restaurants, bars, cinemas and clubs all shutting up shop for the foreseeable future. Thousands of staff members have been put on furlough, with the government paying % of their wages in an effort to protect jobs.When will pubs reopen  Pubs look set to be in the last wave of businesses to reopen as the lockdown eases in several phases. That means we do not have a set date for when they will open their doors. Pubs could reopen at the end of August or early September, according to a draft -page plan to take the country out of lockdown.But Downing Street has made clear any dates could change. This is because each phase will only go aheadthe scientic advice suggests coronavirus is not spiking up again in the UK. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.” When pubs do reopen, customers would be expected to follow strict social distancing rules to minimise the risk of COVID- spreading. But ministers at one point refused to rule out the possibility that pubs would be closed until Christmas. And speaking about society in general, Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.

Plans to celebrate  years since the end of World War Two in Europe were due to take place over a three-day weekend from May -, with the May Day bank holiday moved to the Friday for the festivities. Red Arrows and Battle of Britain memorial flypasts, a procession down The Mall and a thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey were all planned. Pubs were due to be allowed to stay open until am during the three-day weekend. These plans have been postponed with the UK in lockdown Coronavirus Briefing newsletter, although the Friday May  bank holiday remains. Itaposs been suggested some plans could be delayed until the weekend of VJ Day in mid-August , rather than cancelled altogether. However, there are ways you can celebrate VE Day at home. Singing and dancing The Queen will make a televised address, which will be followed by a UK-wide sing-along to Dame Vera Lynn’s We’ll Meet Again at pm. The song, which helped keep spirits up during the war, will be used again to help with morale during the coronavirus lockdown. -year-old Dame Vera will lead the sing-along herself from her Sussex home, and viewers are encouraged to join in. Both the Queen’s address and the sing-along will be part of BBC One’s VE Day : The People’s Celebration, starting at pm on Friday. Beforehand you can practise We’ll Meet Again and listen to other wartime classics such as Goodnight Sweetheart, Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy and Over the Rainbow. All are on a Spoty playlist put together by Bletchley Park, home of the codebreakers who cracked the Nazi’s Enigma Code. If you prefer dancing though, then why not learn the Lindy Hop, the American swing dance from New York that US troops brought to the UK during the war. English Heritage has some basic instructions to help you learn the moves, including The Swing Out, the most important move of the dance. Food English Heritage’s party pack also includes a series of s recipes to help you enjoy a typical VE Day dish. You can learn how to make cheese and marmite swirls and carrot scones, washed down with homemade ginger beer or lemonade. If you’d prefer to avoid the hassle of creating your own food, the Morrisons VE Day Afternoon Tea box is full of sandwiches, scones and cakes. Museums It’s impossible to visit museums right now, however the Imperial War Museum will have a soundscape for people to listen to from Friday. It will contain stories of four-minute accounts from people who came together during the war and their recollections of what happened when the fighting was over.

A few months earlier, in June , the British had been smashed near Tobruk and sent packing. It was the lowest point of British generalship in the entire war: a needless defeat caused by bad command decisions and faulty tactics. That the Eighth Army avoided annihilation was largely due to the Desert Air Force, who had developed exciting new tactics for close air support – tactics that would be further honed by the end of the war. General Harold Alexander, Britain’s most experienced commander, and Montgomery were brought in, steadied the ship, then struck back, and this time decisively, sending Rommel’s forces speeding back across Egypt, Libya and into Tunisia.  Meanwhile, a joint Anglo-US force landed in pro-Axis French Algeria and Morocco and moved in a pincer movement from the west. By this time, Britain had worked out its way of war, which was to use immense firepower, brought about by a marriage of air, land and sea power. It had realised that German troops always counter-attacked. The moment they did, the Allies would emerge from their foxholes and camouflaged positions and the full weight of their firepower would then rain down upon the Germans – immense artillery, low-level bombers and fighter aircraft, and,close enough, off-shore naval guns too. It meant using a stick to goad them in the first place, which was why being a British infantryman or part of a tank crew was so incredibly dangerous, but it did mean these troops were comparatively few in number. Only around % of the Army were infantry and % were in tanks. Some %, on the other hand, were service troops, maintaining and supplying those at the coal face with food, ammunition, new tanks, trucks, spare parts and medical supplies and so on. Tunisia fell in May , the same month U-boats were largely withdrawn from the Atlantic, which meant the British and Americans could plan operations more effectively as they knew pretty much exactly what supplies were likely to reach them whether in the Mediterranean or in Britain, where preparations had begun for the cross-Channel invasion of France in . In the meantime, British and American troops launched the largest-ever amphibious operation – in terms of numbers of men landed – against Sicily on July , . This was a phenomenally dficult operation logistically, but in a sign of growing confidence, air, land and naval forces worked together to conquer the island in  days, hastening the overthrow of Mussolini. The Allies then invaded southern Italy whilst also building up for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, which took place on June , , two days after Rome fell. Despite the Americanisation of D-Day, largely thanks to Hollywood, D-Day itself was a predominantly British show. All three service chiefs were British,  of the , warships were British, , of the , landing craft were British, two thirds of the aircraft were British and two thirds of the troops landed were British and Canadian. It is true that American industrial muscle was truly exceptional and yes, the United States did, in many ways, become the Arsenal of Democracy. It was, however, British cash that kick-started this process in  and  and lend-lease ­actually cut both ways: some % of all US supplies in the European Theatre of Operations were provided by us. The Liberty ship, the prefabricated ,-ton merchant vessels churned out by US shipyards, was designed by a Brit, Cyril Thompson, and the initial shipyards on the east and west coasts of the States built with British money. D-Day was, of course, a success, and British forces continued to play a key part in the war in Italy and north-west Europe until the end of the war. Air power remained key to British strategy, and while initially, bombing was inaccurate and underwhelming, by March , when Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris launched his all-out bombing offensive, Britain had pioneered new navigational aids such as Gee, Oboe, and the first ground-mapping radar, HS, and bombing accuracy improved enormously. The levels of destruction by the RAF’s night bombers were incredible, but regardless of the debates about the morality, it unquestionably had a profoundly detrimental effect on Germany’s ability to wage war. It also saved British lives. The Lancaster bomber and Mosquito were also two incredible designs that played big roles in the air war. What’s more, by the middle of , RAF Bomber Command was able to strike – with unequalled accuracy – not least  Squadron, who earlier on May  and  carried out the successful raid against the German dams. Britain’s approach to war never stood still. In the Far East, the demands were even greater. There were few places in the world more challenging in which to fight. Disease was re, infrastructure almost nonexistent, and the first attempts to re-invade Burma in late  and early  met with failure. Then came monsoon season and a pause for a reappraisal of approach. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten became Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia and appointed General Bill Slim as his Army commander. Slim reorganised his supply chains, created new forward units for treating malaria – a disease that struck  men for every one battle casualty – gave every single man jungle combat training, and insisted the RAF win air superiority, which they swtly did with the arrival of superior Spitfires in the autumn of . He dramatically improved morale and his men first withstood a Japanese attack at the Admin Box in the Arakan in north-west Burma in February , then fought a fighting retreat to Imphal in north-east India, before counter-attacking at Kohima and destroying the Japanese Fteenth Army. Part of Slim’s success was his continued harnessing of air power. By commanding the skies, the RAF was able to transport two isions to Imphal as well as make numerous supply drops. Slim pushed the Japanese back into Burma and in spring , he brilliantly caught them out at Meiktila. Mandalay and Rangoon fell soon after and Burma was once again back in British hands. Britain had formed the Pacic Fleet in August  and helped the Americans in the Pacic, not least at Okinawa, in April and May . British scientists also played a vital role in the development of the atom bomb. At home, meanwhile, another agricultural revolution had been going on. In , Britain had produced only % of its own food, but by , that figure was %. This enabled shipping that before the war had been used for food to carry arms and war material instead. Rationing was nothing like as bad as where on the continent. The main purpose was to ensure everyone got a fair and balanced diet. This in turn meant they were fitter and healthier and productivity increased as a result. Britain deserves to feel very proud of the contribution it made in the Second World War and its “steel not flesh” policy. Some , people were killed in the war, and although that is a huge number, it was roughly half that of the First World War – and over nearly six years of a truly global conflict, not four.

Exercising, excessively playing with your hair throughout the day and overuse of products can all make it go greasy quickly. So, anything we can do to cut down the number of times we have to go through the gruelling process is appreciated. Thankfully, a woman has an answer for us. TikTok user @annatocks revealed her hair washing routine in a video which she shared to her channel, and fans canapost wait to try it out for themselves. She explains that a DIY clarying rinse, made from apple cider vinegar, baking soda and warm water - along with a little help from dry shampoo - is what helps to keep her hair looking fresh for an entire week. According to Anna, the concoction of vinegar mixed with baking soda balances the scalp PH an claries the root area - meaning it removes any build up!.  Before washing her hair, Anna aggravates her scalp with a hairbrush until it hurts in a good, tingly way, which helps to get rid of any of that dead scalp skin, or dry-shampoo build up. She then adds a teaspoon of baking soda and a couple of splashes of apple cider vinegar to a cup of warm water, before washing her hair in this order - water, clarying rinse, water, shampoo twice and then condition. You may be thinking, why shampoo twice   The first time lts the dirt from the root and the second removes it from the rest of the hair. After washing her hair, she adds a hair product to the ends of her hair - you could use a split-end or treatment. Now, the next step is a little odd. Anna blow dries her roots, but leaves the ends to air dry.  Although she admits she doesnapost know the science behind this, she says: air drying my roots is a disaster.Jessica Thomas for Bustle explains that hair that has been dried with a hairdryer has a rouge texture which means the oils on your scalp take longer to appear, and letting your hair dry whilst you sleep can cause it to tangle and causes grease - the wet hair on your scalp wouldnapost help either.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror emailTo prolong the dreaded hair wash, Anna also adds a little dry shampoo around days three or four, and suggests spraying it before you go to bed to really let it sink in. And people were quick to praise her for sharing the handy tip. One person said: Yes girl Iaposm a cosmetologist and I approve. With this routine even the oiliest of scalps will last for days!

They explain that they are fortunate to be able to continue their job as normal as thereaposs no need to be in the office, but admit they have let some aposbad habitsapos creep in. Arguing that  per cent of meetings could just be an email, they say many people donapost enable the video when they are asked to join a meeting on Zoom. The anonymous worker revealed thatthey are in a call they know wonapost be important, they mute the microphone and sit on the sofa, play video games and browse the internet. Or eat lunch. The problem came about because the person said they have an aposodd quirkapos which they do when eating alone, and it was exposed recently when they thought the mic was muted during a call - leaving them mortied. I talk to my food and to myself, they said. On the day in question I had a sandwich and some pita chips with hummus. So, for example, I said something like aposMmmmm, thereaposs hummus among us!apos Or when I had a chip I would say things like aposThataposs what I call a chip!apos or aposWelcome to my mouth, Mr. Pita!apos And the sandwich, I pretended it insulted me, so I was like aposDid you just call me a b****  Hooo boy, you just buttered the wrong biscuit. NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!apos Or later I would comfort it, like Donapost worry, had my fiber gummy, youaposre coming out smooth. Mm hmmmmapos. Paying little attention to the meeting, they realised their name was being said and it quickly set in that everyone on the other end could hear every word.  The manager demanded they muted the microphone as others laughed, and the worker mumbled an apology in embarrassment. The manager sent a stern email afterwards and colleagues have been making fun of what they overheard on the work instant messaging service. Panicking that it may have a negative effect on their career, others on Reddit were quick to reassure the worker when they revealed they were considering quitting the following day.  One person advised: You probably find that it brought a ray of happiness to some people in this stressful time. Get in on jokes and take it on the chin, it could have been a lot worse. We all have our little quirks that we hide away.

The footage is just one of a number of videos on the Instagram page and was seen more than , times since it was posted on March . Explaining more about the unusual friendship, the channel’s owner – who chose not to give their name said: “I originally had all the cameras up high so I could see the whole room, and I noticed that Joule and Kelvin were on the couch together.  “So I moved the camera to point directly at the couch, and realised that they werenapost just on the couch together, but they were snuggling. “I think Kelvin really helps with Jouleaposs anxiety. Kelvin has always been friendly with the dogs, but I never realised the extent of it until I got the cameras.” The recent clip sparked a torrent of comments from viewers remarking on how adorable the sight is. “Love the hello ‘meow’, kisses and head boops,” one wrote. “Kelvin has so much love to give.”  “So I moved the camera to point directly at the couch, and realised that they werenapost just on the couch together, but they were snuggling. “I think Kelvin really helps with Jouleaposs anxiety.

last conversation with Mal Brannigan, we made it clear that we hadn’t shut the door on anything.”In a statement issued on April , Ogren claimed the Tangerines could not agree to the conditions tied to potential DUSF investment and would be creating a new foundation themselves.He said: “After initially being told the organisation was there to assist our club with monies which have been raised throughout their membership, we as a board were not willing to fulfil the unreasonable demands of DUSF encompassing a requirement for shares and thereafter a secured loan.“This is particularly

defended its proposals as “fair and reasonable”.They said: “Our objective was to protect our members’ interests whilst also enabling us to assist the club.“We have also had to ensure we discharge our

wilkie mal brannigan dundee united","story":"Mal Brannigan’s exit from Tannadice on Friday night was a surprise – for the first time in Mark Ogren’s reign there are some uncomfortable questions to answer.It did appear like a bolt out of the blue, Brannigan had been interviewed in this very paper just the day before he left his role as managing director.A sudden departure for a club’s managing director raises questions over what is going on behind the scenes.There are obvious issues there, evenwe don’t really know what’s brought about the decision to part company.The manner of the club in dealing with the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation raised some suspicion a couple of weeks back.It came across as an extreme reaction to a fan group looking to hand over a serious sum of money they had raised.To blacklist them so publicly was a very strange move.That was the first time there had been anything other than positive news coming out of the club since the Ogrens took over.Brannigan’s departure coming so soon afterwards makes it dficult to think anything other than they are linked in some way.Like the rest of the fans, I am on the outside looking in.But it doesn’t seem like everything is as rosy behind the scenes as we’d been led to believe.That doesn’t mean there’s a scandal waiting to be uncovered but a bit of clarity from the club in what’s been going on would be good.Fallings out and disagreements behind the scenes tend to happen when things aren’t going so well on the pitch.That’s what has jarred so much about this past couple of weeks at United.The club are in such a good place, they’ve won the Championship and are gearing up for the Premiership next season.Money has been invested in the first team, the academy and certainly around the stadium.The Ogrens’ reign has been pretty much positive right the way through.The sort of questions this last fortnight has brought about will be unwanted ones from their point of view.It’s certainly not the kind of attention the Americans or those involved with running the club want or need right now.I just hope it’s not an indication there are problems at Tannadice.Until we hear more from the club, all United fans will be concerned about that scenario.Just like everyone , I was keen to hear John Nelms’ viewpoint on the SPFL voting farce last month.I thought he came out of the interview in the Tele very well.I agree with him that Dundee were stuck between a rock and a hard place – being third they would be unlikely to go up in any league reconstruction.Any benefit would be a longer-term thing where they’ll likely be in a good position for promotion to the Premiership in the new set-up.You could feel the frustration in Nelms from his quotes about the position he and Dundee had been left in by the SPFL.I actually felt quite bad for him over the way it had all been handled by the powers-that-be.You could tell he was holding back on what he thought of Inverness and the leaked WhatsApp messages, too!Nelms came across well and made a good point about Rangers – the vote didn’t even concern the Gers directly so why did the fans all go crazy at Dundee The football world never ceases to amaze.Tommy Wright did a great job at St Johnstone – consistently challenging despite not having the budget to really compete with the big boys.I have to say I found the timing of his departure from McDiarmid Park strange.Maybe he’d just had enough of battling away for so long.Technically this season isn’t even over yet. Maybe the shutdown just gave him enough time to think about his future.And the Northern Ireland manager’s gig is available…This week we’ll see what evidence Rangers have on the SPFL over the voting saga. I have to say I’m keen to see what they have – after all this time,it’s nothing major, they’ll be left with egg on faces. months free access to our web and ePaper pack including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/d930a3ce-d2c5-4e59-b62e-698607e936f5-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/d930a3ce-d2c5-4e59-b62e-698607e936f5-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/d930a3ce-d2c5-4e59-b62e-698607e936f5-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/d930a3ce-d2c5-4e59-b62e-698607e936f5-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

The group now boasts more than  members, according to Lisa.She says: ldquoThe Facebook group is a big success, but we quickly realised more needed to be done.\"As supermarket shelves were stripped, older people continued to head out looking for supplies. We felt there must be another way to help high risk groups.\"Equally, local businesses were worried about the virus affecting their trade. In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver. But these exciting plans looked to be scuppered with the imposition of lockdown.Thankfully, though, postman Keith Borthwick came to the rescue, explained Lisa.She says: \"He made sure that every house received a copy of the newsletter with their mail.

Everyone in the village is being really friendly.With so many currently living in isolation, volunteers are also reaching out by phone. ldquoIf people arenrsquot on the Internet, itrsquos easy for them to be left out, says Liz Ellis, who has lived in Newstead for  years. ldquoTherefore a few of us are making regular phone calls to people all over the village just to say hello, seethey need anything and have a friendly chat.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

He said: ldquoI honestly donrsquot think I have ever read a fantasy novel!ldquoThat same literary agent, when she was trying to get a publisher for Snowball Oranges, told me detective novels were always popular.ldquoIrsquove never read one of those either and she said, lsquowell,you write one it will be original, evenit is rubbishrsquo.ldquoThat was the same attitude I took towards writing the fantasy novel.ldquoThe reaction so far has been quite encouraging.Peter was in popular s jazz band the Clyde Valley Stompers, who charted with Peter and The Wolf and were supported by The Beatles before the Fab Four made it big.Later, Peter produced more than  albums ndash including the Royal Scots Dragoon Guardsrsquo international chart-topper Amazing Grace ndash the biggest-selling instrumental of all time with  million sales.Thank you for reading this story.

We know local newsagents deliver to many people, but this short-term scheme will ensure that people who donrsquot get a delivery or who canrsquot afford a Courier are kept in touch. It is also important to support the Courier during this periodwe are to see it survive. Newspapers are essential for local democracy and the Courier regularly reports on issues we discuss at the council.One of the volunteers who deliver the newspaper is Susan Taylor ndash in her beloved Dolly CV which goes by the name of Myrtille.Susan, whose day job is working for the Church of Scotland as an executive assistant, is one of the team of resilience group volunteers picking up prescriptions for residents.ldquoI volunteered because I really feel for those people in our community who are at risk and isolated due to the Covid- outbreak, she said. ldquoI have met some lovely people so far and am glad I am in a position to help.The project is paid for through the townrsquos Community Emergency Resilience Fund ndash which comprises public donations, funding from North Berwick Community Council and the North Berwick Trust.Rotary Haddington was always looking for ways to support its community, said club president Malcolm Collins.ldquoOur idea to bulk-buy and distribute copies of the Courier to the elderly and vulnerable originated from one of our members who was quick to realise that a signicant number of such people would soon begin to feel isolated and lose touch with what was happening locallythey were unable to get out and buy a copy, he added.ldquoAs well as providing local news, the initiative shown by the Courier by including pages of extra puzzles in the paper was also thought to be useful to help keep folk entertained during these dficult times.ldquoWe have now taken this idea forward and arranged to bulk-buy copies of the Courier each week in advance, have them delivered to a central hub and then arranged for them to be distributed to other locations where they can be made available to those in need e.g. Our Community Kitchen, those in care homes and other locations as they become known to us.Rotary Haddington members would ensure that the papers were delivered where they were needed, he added.Courier Editor Robbie Scott said: ldquoWersquore so grateful to these groups for supporting our communities during lockdown and the amazing work they do inspires us to produce the best papers that we can.ldquoFor them to also directly support us at a dficult time for all businesses is incredible and we thank them immensely.Anyone wishing to buy copies of the Courier for delivery to communities should email rscott@eastlothiancourier.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

It is better known as a way of cocooning infants through the immunisation of close family members against disease.The team from Edinburgh University, Imperial College London, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled a range of scenarios to illustrate how dferent restrictions could be applied to dferent groups.They show \"the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of  weeks after lockdown\"Their findings have been made available to the UK and Scottish Governments.The strategy involves segmenting the population into dferent risk groups, based on a personrsquos medical history and potential healthcare needs.: Scotlands death rate from Covid likely to be lower than rest of UK due to lockdown timingAs a result, younger healthy adults and children, as well as over-s without any ailments associated with an increasedrisk from Covid,would resume something closer to normal le.Those most at risk - who currently fall within the shielded category - would continue to stay at home, with the added safeguard of targeted virus screening.They write: \"Intensive screening would, ideally, include daily checks for symptoms, daily tests for virus presence , regular serological [antibody] testing and monitoring of frequent contactsof shielders.\"If too large fraction of the population were to be classied as lsquoshieldersrsquo this would quickly overwhelm current testing capacity in the UK.\"Nonetheless, routine rapid testing of shielders could have a signicant impact and further increase the scope for relaxing restrictions on the entire population.\"Researchers say lockdown restrictions could be eased for most people, as long as sufficient public health measures stay in place to keep transmission rates low.These would include self-isolation of people with Covid-, quarantining affected households, contact tracing and voluntary social distancing.The most vulnerable ndash the frail elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer, heart or respiratory diseasesndash would still need to be shielded from contact with anyone potentially infected with the virus.To achieve this, people sharing a house with a vulnerable person, care workers and health professionals would need to protect themselves from infection.However, the risk to the rest of the population could be managed without resorting to lockdown.Asked about a potential \"two-tier approach\" to leaving lockdown, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said policymakers had to weigh up \"the fairness or potential unfairness\" of any approach.\"Is it fair  The judgement might be yes, it is, because we cant allow the quest for perfection to be the enemy of good progress. But we have to think about these things.\"None of us want to have a two-tier or a multi-tier society.\"The study stresses that the general non-shielding population will continue to be the \"main reservoir of infection\", therefore surveillance measures to contain the spread of the virus will be essential, say the researchers.They write: \"It is therefore vital that transmission rates are kept as low as possible, eventhis population is allowed to exit lockdown.\"Measures including self-isolation of cases, quarantining of affected households, contact tracing and voluntary physical distancing will be necessary to achieve this.\"In all our scenarios the vulnerable segment is subject to increased protection indefinitely. [Segmenting and shielding] is also more likely to succeedthere is less or no relaxation of restrictions on shielders.\"They say that contact tracing can include \"both traditional and app-based\" methods.However, the researchers caution that not enough is known about the build-up of immunity in affected populations and stress that this aspect of the epidemic needs to be monitored very closely.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburghrsquos Usher Institute, said: ldquoEasing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff.\"Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  Far from bringing the UK closer  Covid is pushing it further apart","story":"This pandemic has been nationalisms moment. Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends. That is to be commended. There would always have to be cooperation between Scotland and England. But far from reviving the United Kingdom as a going concern, this pandemic could be the final nail in its coffin.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Closer to . and Covid transmission would be in a sustained decline closer to one and it would be on the cusp of accelerating out of control again as soon as lockdown is eased.: Scientists call for two-track approachthat would free majority from lockdown earlierThat is why the next few weeks are so crucial. Driving the R number down to . or lower would give the Government the ldquoheadroom to cope, as Ms Sturgeon put it, with the inevitable increases in infection rates that would follow the lting of any of the current control measures.Think of it as a precariously balanced see-saw where increased compliance with lockdown tilts the R number down, and a growing percentage of the population flouting the guidance tilts it up.The First Minister has sought to incentivise cooperation by outlining the possible freedoms and benefits which could be re-introduced before the end of Maythe evidence says it is safe to do so .Schools could be partially re-opened some NHS elective procedures and screening could resume people could be allowed to meet up with a small lsquobubblersquo of friends and family outwith their household more time outdoors for exercise and manufacturing, retail and construction businesses could be allowed operate again, as long as workplaces could be made safe and commuters did not overcrowd public transport.None of this is guaranteed, however. Rather, it is a carrot for a restless population bored of staying at home and lulled into a  sense of security by Boris Johnsonrsquos ldquopast the peak proclamations.: People who test positive for Covid could be offered accommodation away from household in new test, trace and isolate phaseAnd this is the crux of the problem the Scottish Government is facing. If the public take on board the FMrsquos pleas, stick with the rules, and even increase their compliance, then the R number will reduce, some small freedoms will be re-introduced, and the strategy will be seen as a success.But whatthey donrsquot  Already there are signs that lockdown is fraying: statistics point to more car traffic on the roads and more bus journeys being taken anecdotally people speak of their local neighbourhoods growing busier some cafes have opened for takeaways and motorists were seen queued up in their hundreds outside a Costa Coffee Drive-thru in Glasgow at the weekend. Warmer weather and sunshine wonrsquot help matters.If this continues, and the R number goes up not down, will the Scottish Government really countenance extending or even toughening up on its lockdown measures in the face of a clear pushback from the population that would render it ineffective anyway There is of course more to weigh up than just suppressing the virus. There are the detrimental impacts of lockdown on physical and mental health.While the focus has been on Covid, some cancer patients have seen their surgery or chemotherapy put on hold for their own safety and offered potentially less effective treatments such as radiotherapy or immunotherapy in the meantime. There are also thousands in pain as they wait for hip or knee replacements or struggling with ever-deteriorating vision while their cataract removal is delayed. That cannot continue.Workers in frontline mental health have described people presenting in crisis who had no prior history of psychiatric illness. That is probably only the tip of the iceberg.The economy has noseed and furlough has been extended until the end of June. But whatthe UK Governmentsuspend it after that or impose stricter criteria  The ripple effect for public health of soaring unemployment and loss of income is well-known.: Only % of Scotlands virus testing capacity usedSo we really are approaching a critical moment - for the Government.One escape route touted by scientists this week is a two-tier ldquosegmenting and shielding approach that would allow the majority of the population to resume something closer to normality sooner.Younger people and those without underlying conditions or co-morbidities would be lsquoreleasedrsquo while those at higher risk continue to be ldquoshielded from the general population.This has its appeal, but deciding who to shield could be complicated. A blanket restriction based on age would be controversial.Butdecided by health, does that mean we should include obesityand confine nearly a third of Scotlandrsquos adult population indoors Lockdown cannot go on forever.

During said lockdown had not one but two assignations with his lover who lived across town, thus breaking the same rules that he had been promoting  Yes. Did so knowing that he had had the virus and had self-isolated for ldquoalmost two weeks  Yes. I think we have a clear winner here. Go on Neil, step on that rake!: Deaths in Scotland fall for first timeOne of many new words the crisis has given us is the term ldquocovidiot, used to shame people who are behaving in selfish, ignorant or arrogant ways and breaking the rules. It is usually applied to crowds of faceless ldquolittle people, when in truth some of the biggest covidiots of all are known to us and occupy positions of power and influence.Take the Prime Minister. Papers from the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesreleased this week show the Government was warned about the risk of shaking hands on March . The same day, Boris Johnson boasted of doing so with hospital patients, some of whom he thought had the virus. He went on to shake hands at a rugby match, then at a service in Westminster Abbey. Mr Johnson, as we know, went on to contract the virus and become very poorly indeed. People cannot help becoming ill. One thinks, in particular, about those who day after day are exposed to the virus often without proper protection. But for a PM to openly defy advice, and brag about doing so, was idiotic.The crisis reached a grisly milestone on Tuesday when it was confirmed that the UK had the highest reported death toll in Europe, worse than any other country in the world bar America. Not that such comparisons are encouraged. A new feature of the daily Downing Street briefings, and ministerial interviews, is the bit where we are told that comparing death tolls at this stage is unwise and unhelpful. Mr Johnson trotted out the same line yesterday when he made his long-awaited debut against Keir Starmer at PMQs.The ldquono comparisons argument goes like this. Dferent countries count deaths dferently and, while the next bit is largely unspoken, some of them cannot be relied on to tell the truth. Only after the crisis has passed, and after much data mining, can we say with any certainty how well, or otherwise, countries have performed. In the meantime, critics should put a sock in it and stop being wise after the event. Everyone is doing their best. Unprecedented times. Bad for morale, and so on.What nonsense. The idea that conclusions cannot be drawn at this point is ridiculous. More covidiocy. The process is already happening. On The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, was askedfewer people would have died had there been more testing earlier on. ldquoYes, he said. ldquoIf we had had , test-capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively, Irsquom sure many things could be dferent. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Governmentrsquos chief scientic adviser, told MPs this week: ldquoIn the early phases,we had managed to ramp testing capacity quicker, it would have been beneficial.: Johnson gives signal on lockdown ltingAll over the country people are making their own minds up. They know the UK was too slow on testing too slow on lockdown not fast enough in tackling the crisis engulfing care homes and fell down on the job when it came to stockpiling the right protective equipment. Meanwhile, visitors from stricken countries poured in, untested.If the evidence points to such conclusions, why not admit the mistakes and learn from them  It would go against every fibre of governments to do so, but just as they are quick to claim credit for what has gone right, so they should acknowledge where things went wrong. Only in that way can the public be sure governments are learning from mistakes.With the lting of the lockdown approaching this matters more than ever. We are being told that nothing is certain. Scientic advice will be followed. Right decisions at the right time. Slow, steady and safe. Yoursquove heard the record before.How can we be sure this will be the case  The pressure to lt the lockdown, there from the start, is building. Though Scotlandrsquos First Minister continues to caution against any move being made soon, there has been a noticeable change of tone at UK Government level.The big push is on. Ministers who previously wanted to throw a supportive arm around anxious workers with furlough schemes are now fretting over the cost. There is a drip feed of stories in the media about what le after lockdown will look like.After being terried into staying at home we are being asked to believe that it will soon be safe to go back out there. The Prime Minister cannot wait to get going, despite his talk of caution. In the Commons yesterday he had to admit that he planned to unveil his plans to the public on Sunday via a televised address, rather than bringing them to the Commons first, because some changes could happen on Monday.Confidence or arrogance  Once again, the public is being asked to trust, without hesitation, the experts and the governments they advise. Two groups we now know contain people who do not follow their own guidance, and who, in the main, will not acknowledge they did anything wrong.

As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, Head of Archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember. Some show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location. Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff.The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued. The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever. Last year along, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around . Dr Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom. Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ms Ferguson added: ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

Some people have accused the UK Government of acting, especially in the early days of the crisis, asthe British were somehow special, asBritish lungs would be resistant to foreign bugs, or we should do things dferently from Europe. They called it British exceptionalism.But there are signs of the same attitude in some of Scotlandrsquos response. To be fair to the Scottish Government, it has worked closely with the other administrations, but you can see a bit of exceptionalism in its approach to the tracing app being developed in London: Scotland might use the app, wersquore told, but onlyit works with Scottish systems. Therersquos a hint too we might want our own app. Our own spaceship.The problem with all of this is the same problem wersquove seen where in our response to the crisis: a tendency to talk about the virus in ways that do not increase our understanding of it. The virus doesnrsquot know when itrsquos crossed the border between Scotland and England, and lots of people cross the border every day, so we should have a response that works on both sides of it, and to talk in terms of Scottish and English apps is confusing. It doesnrsquot acknowledge how the virus actually works.The same applies to the issue of targets on testing: they too are a way of talking about the virus that doesnrsquot increase our understanding of it. The target that the UK Government has set itself is , tests a day, although the PM Boris Johnson was again suggesting this week that in time it might be , or more. This is the first problem with targets: why , or ,  Why not some other random number  What is the methodology The second problem is how targets affect behaviour and we can see it in the British Governmentrsquos approach and in many other areas of public le. When the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the daily target was being met, it was then revealed that the , figure included , tests that had been posted to people but might not actually have been carried out. But, you know, the target was met.This is exactly what targets do. Wersquove seen it before in hospitals with patients being made to wait in ambulances to meet AE targets and you may have seen it in your own workplace: management set a target and staff proceed to come up with ingenious and sometimes misleading ways of meeting it rather than working in a more honest way. The target becomes the focus rather than the problem it was supposed to fix. Worse: the target can conceal whatrsquos really going on.A better approach would be to drop the virus testing targets altogether and try to assess whatrsquos going on in a more sophisticated way. Are we getting the tests to the right people, for example staff in care homes  Are drive-through centres the best way of delivering the tests  Should the home testing kits be going to hospitals and care homes instead  Therersquos a danger that questions like that are not being asked because instead wersquore constantly asking: have we met the , target You can see the same need for a more nuanced approach when it comes to drawing comparisons with other countries. Wersquore now being told the UK has the worst coronavirus death rate in the world after the US, but dferent countries have dferent types of population, they can have more city dwellers than others, and, most importantly, countries do not all count the deaths in the same way. In other words, the comparisons can darken the picture rather than clear it.And it doesnrsquot end there because the next big test for how we think about the virus will be the end of lockdown. Some people tell me they wonrsquot leave home ldquountil itrsquos safe to do so, but ldquosafe isnrsquot a hugely helpful word here. A better word to use would be ldquorisk because wersquoll get out of lockdown when we work out, personally and collectively, what an acceptable level of risk is and then start living through it.

No community deserves this tag and for a day or so these streets piqued the curiosity of the media caravan before it moved on to feed on the misfortunes of some other benighted place.Our new friend is in trouble and perhaps sees in the councillor something solid and reliable. Soon, he is relating to us the events of the last  hours. These have not been vintage ones for our boy and have involved assault, robbery and a quest for medical relief that requires to be resolved in the next few hours. This isnrsquot a cry for help itrsquos a one-act tragedy.He needs to get to a council office and then a clinic before the close of business and so we chip in to get him a taxi. Hersquos mortied about taking our money though, and is only convinced to accept it when the councillor promises to come to his door ldquoafter Mass on Sunday night. He seems more relaxed now and says that we are a pair of ldquogood c**ts. As the taxi arrives he asks uswersquore behaving ourselves and, with a twinkle in his eye, entreats us to look after ourselves. He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.ldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in. And we fans of Greenock Morton FC take enormous pride in the fact that when it came to the crunch, we fought to keep our club back in . The local community support came to the fore then. But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre. A tennis club, a private school and a fancy hotel sit just a few streets away from the corner that houses five betting shops. ldquoFrom a planning perspective, says Councillor McEleny, ldquoyou have to ask how we allowed a system that allowed the town centre to be hollowed out and then filled with franchises and chains and the practice of permitting the bookies to take up all the empty shop spaces.Yet, he refuses to dwell on the glories of Greenockrsquos shipbuilding past and the well-paid jobs that made this place thrum with productivity and economic health. Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this. Scotlandrsquos new Social Security hubs in Glasgow and Dundee are providing  jobs. Most of these are relatively high-paying, skilled jobs and would have made much more of a dference in Greenock than in Glasgow city centre. He salutes the Greenock , the much-loved local newspaper which has been chronicling and supporting the town for  years. ldquoLike many other local papers, they could have moved to the outskirts, but theyrsquore still here in the heart of the town centre. Itrsquos a very powerful symbol of solidarity and much appreciated around here.ldquoNeither Santander or Scottish Power are going to build large facilities here but our public sector has the ability to do this. Cities must accept thatwe want thriving towns which feed the cities then wersquove got to start doing things dferently or these communities and ones like Bute and the Western Isles are just going to keep depopulating.For those of us who live in and around cities itrsquos easy to forget that smaller and more far-flung places all need the same level of services: the bins still need to be picked up education and policing still has to be provided. But with fewer people yoursquove got less taxation to pay for it. The economic model is broken but it could be fixed with a little imagination.ldquoAny time a developer wants to build new houses therersquos supposed to be a mix to promote social cohesion. But the developers get round this by offering little parcels of land cheaply for social housing so that they donrsquot spoil their fancy developments with it. This creates social ision.Coronavirus has now rendered the recent multi-deprivation statistics obsolete. Inverclyde now has the highest death rate in the country due to the disease according to the latest National Records of Scotland statistics. The region has had  deaths per , people, a figure nearly three times that of the death rate in the least deprived areas. In neighbouring East Renfrewshire itrsquos  per , and in East Dunbartonshire itrsquos currently .This pandemic, like all the others before it, preys on the poor. We like to think of Scotland as a progressive country, inclusive of all. Yet, in the numbers that gather around le and death nothing really changes for the people who live out of sight and beyond the limits of our imagination and compassion."},{"url":null,"title":"ve-day-wwii-burma-hero-captain-tom-moores-just-giving-fundraising-miracle","story":"But he has now won hearts around the nation afterdeciding, aged , to walk  laps

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Government measures should reflect this reality and the seasonal nature of the industry.“We know that a short-term financial fix will not be sufficient for companies and self-employed people who rely on the summer trade to see them through the rest of the year.

Could we get the website sorted so that people get the information that they need, rather than thinking that in order to get a test they have to first get a plane or a ferry ”Responding, the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, said: “It’s a very important question and I’ll look into the specics of it to make sure that our island communities get the appropriate response in the website. He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers. There were positive words from the Health Secretary on getting these working for the isles.  This doesn#t need to be complicated.  It just needs to be fixed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was announced yesterday that the Scottish Government would pass this funding along in full to Scottish councils.Council leaders appealed to the Scottish Government through COSLA, which represents local authorities in Scotland, to give the funding directly to Scottish councils immediately to help them provide essential services at a time when costs are increasing signicantly and income has dropped substantially due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking following yesterday#s announcement, councillor Stockan said: “The announcement from the Scottish Government has shown the value in council leaders working on a common cause together at a time of crisis to press the Scottish Government to give us the support we so badly need and deserve. The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though. There is more funding that should be available to us and we will continue to fight for that. Local councils are facing unprecedented dficulties.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !! As you asked, for what it is worth, I have lived in Shetland  years now, longer than anywhere . Just the relevance of that is a bit beyond me but it seems you wish to know!!Ian, since I don’t live in Crug Hywel , a walk from where I do liveand back would be  miles. In my marathon running days that would have been a decent evening run but those days have gone. A short walk of  miles would be easier now.Ian, you did a Trump special and answered a query I did not make. I did not ask you how long you’ve lived on Shetland. My question was where do you hail from Haydn, I wrote rotor noise, not Chinook engine noise. Do not put words in my mouth. Now close up in a gale the continuous noise compares to engine noise fo a jet engine, I believe Chinooks are turbojet-powered. Now your  Ferndale turbines are tiny compared to the Shetland proposed -meter monsters.

Those people can then undergo further tests with the hope of slowing the spread of the disease.Soon after the outbreak, however, the national response moved from the #contain# phase to #delay# and most contact tracing was halted.This week has seen itas a key part of the national strategy.The government announced yesterdaythat a new contact tracing app was going to be piloted in the Isle of Wight as part of the first phase of the #test, track and trace# programme.When someone reports symptoms through the app, it will alert other users whom the person has been in recent contact with. Those users will then be sent advice, including how to get a test.The app is hoped to ramp up contact tracing and reduce the spread of the virus.Mr Dickson said it  was an important part of the strategy # and he felt the Isle of Wight pilot could have useful implications for Shetland, which shares some similarities, as an island community.Although the Isle of Wight is closer to the mainland and has a larger population, it has a single health board and Mr Dickson said it faced many of the same challenges as Shetland.In order to be effective, however, the app needs a signicant proportion of the population to sign-up, which could pose dficulties in isolated communities such as Shetland, where connectivity is poor in some areas.There have also been concerns raised about data privacy.But Mr Dickson said he was optimistic that folk in Shetland would support the programmeand when it was rolled out locally.#I#ve always found the people of Shetland to be hugely positive at responding to these sorts of challenges,# he said.#I#ve got no doubt that they will do the same here.#Until the app is rolled out more widely, however, Shetland#s contact tracing programme will be along the traditional  methodology.#Right now the digital  is not available for us,# said Mr Dickson. # So it#s back to the grind stone and the hard work of checking where people have been.#Nationally, , staff have been recruited to help with the manual checking of people#s movements, as an alternative tracing programme for those who do not have access to a smartphone or good connectivity.Mr Dickson said that in Shetland, health workers who have been unable to perform their usual work, due to the Covid- crisis, such as dentists, would be ready to help with the programme.But although Mr Dickson said it was possible to carry out this method of contact tracing effectively in Shetland, he said it would be a #Herculean# task to do it on a national level requiring an estimated , staff.With the digital , he said much of that need for labour could be reduced.But while the contact tracing is a useful step forward, Mr Dickson said it must be considered as part of a wider picture.#I think it#s a really useful string to the bow of the wider orchestra that we need to overcome this,# he said.He highlighted the NHS#s work helping care homes and delivering PPE as other ongoing parts of its work fighting the virus. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael calls on pm to be guided by science over coronavirus ","story":"Criticism has been levelled against Boris Johnson’s lockdown exit strategy, with Shetland’s MP claiming the Prime Minister is coming under too much pressure from Conservative backbenchers.Alistair Carmichael says he fears the PM is failing to rely on scientic evidence which has so far guided measures taken to combat coronavirus.It comes after Mr Johnson signalled measures would be eased on Monday next week.Identying ways for businesses to get staff members back to work are among the possible areas for change.Meanwhile, the Scottish government has welcomed a fall in the rate of deaths linked to coronavirus north of the border.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned progress against the virus was “too fragile” to “immediately ease restrictions in any meaningful way”.For his part, Mr Carmichael believes there may be “some opportunities” for relaxing restriction measures # but onlythe science backs that up.s: “Some of what I hear does worry me, because it looks to me assome of what they are talking about involves easing lockdown because they are getting pressure from their own backbenchers to do that.Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. “The question of how we manage lockdown has to be done on the basis of scientic evidence.”He added: “My worry is that the longer it goes on the more influence the economy and political considerations will make over scientic and medical ones.”Mr Carmichael added his priorities would be to get school children back in their classrooms and “as many local businesses as we can ing again for the benefit of the people who need local services”.“I think it’s probably unrealistic to expect that we’re going to have tourists coming back here for most of this season,at all, and I just think these are the areas where we feel lockdown the hardest.”He added: “I don’t think you’re going to get back to full schools from zero.

I expect full testing of care homes in Skye to be carried out.“I am unaware of the situation alluded to by the worker who had to inform colleagues by email.#In light of the outbreak at Home Farm, I firmly believe that the local population deserve the full truth and public health agencies have been transparent about the situation.“This should continue as we all try and limit transmission of the virus any further.”Meanwhile, MP Ian Blackford urged people “not to drop our guard” against the virus.He said: “The spread of the virus in the Highlands has been relatively limited until now, although we certainly have got to make sure that we continue to protect people here.“A place like the Isle of Skye has a large percentage of elderly people.“In my own district the over- are  per cent of the population. We must make sure that we continue to respect the lockdown and continue to do the right things.”Mr Blackford repeated his previous call for holiday-home owners to stay away.He added: “I know this is a beautul area but my message to those will think about coming on holiday here and to second-home owners is please respect the challenges that we face.“You’ll always be welcome in the Highlands when it’s right to welcome people back, but not now.“Don’t think about coming over the course of the next few weeks and months while we battle this invisible killer.“We’re nowhere near through this. We’ve got to make sure we continue to protect people.“The idea of reversing lockdown and business as usual, that has to be a million miles away from what we are considering right now.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/allan-maccoll.jpg","title":"duine gasta coibhneil coir ailean maccolla 1940","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineBha mi duilich cluinntinn gun do dh’eug an duine gaisgeil sin, Ailean MacColla à Mùideirt is Àth Tharrachail is Loch Abair o chionn ghoirid, agus an lùib gach uamhas eile a tha tachairt na làithean seo, chan robh mi airson gun diochuimhnicheamaid an duine no gu dearbha an obair iongantach a rinn Ailean còir airson cànan is dualchas nan Gàidheal.Duine gasta bh’ann an Ailean – agus gu dearbh a bhràthair Teàrlach nach maireann cuideachd – agus tha e doirbh smaoineachadh air sgìre Loch Abair as aonais na seòid sin.

Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

Mr Weir indicated that a phasedof pupils is anticipated alongside the continuation of some remote learning.He said: For many parents and carers, the timing of the reopening of schools is of crucial importance and there has been much speculation on this.Let me state clearly that there is no planned date for the reopening of schools for normal business.He said any decision on this will be driven by the circumstances, guided by science and health advice, and will not be date-driven.Mr Weir added: Whenever schools do , it#s unlikely this will be on a business-as-usual basis.There#s likely to be a phasing of theof pupils alongside some form of remote learning. At all times the safety and wellbeing of our staff and pupils will be our priority.Many issues need to be addressed before schools could reopen.

In Northern Ireland almost one in fivepeople have reconnected with someone they previously lost touch with, while one in have helped a stranger in a matter related to the crisis.Meanwhile, across the UK more than  million people - or % - have clapped for key workers for the past seven weeks and over six million have volunteered to help others during lockdown.Giving his response to the survey, Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International#s Northern Ireland programme director, said the results showed that this is us at our very best.In the midst of dficult times, people here are responding with huge compassion and solidarity towards their neighbours and to those on the frontline, he said.Solidarity and humanity are at the heart of what we do at Amnesty, so this public response has come as no surprise.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

With public gatherings still the subject of prohibitive legislation, the impact has been felt by many local suppliers of wedding music. Kirsty McKenna says the wave of postponements began when the British Prime Minister made his televised announcement on March . “When Boris Johnson had announced there were going to be restrictions put in place, everybody started to panic,” she told the County Derry Post. “Towards the end of March, I started to get messages from people saying they were going to have to postpone their wedding to a dferent date. googletag.cmd.push “I didn’t start getting actual rescheduled dates for a few weeks after that because there’s a lot going on. “Hotels are in a sticky situation too as they don’t know themselves when they’re going to be able to hold weddings again. Some people have postponed until a year after their original date. “It’s quite hard to get a wedding booked in, you nearly need it booked in a year and a half, or two years before your date, because of the high level of bookings people have.” As couples perform the logistical gymnastics required to reschedule their wedding, some will inevitably find that their preferred musician is unavailable for their refixed date. googletag.cmd.push This can result in some awkward conversationsa deposit has already been paid to a supplier, and Kirsty says finding a solution can be tough. “It’s a hard one, because for a lot of people, this is their only form of income,” said the Ballinascreen woman. “None of us saw this coming, so I can sympathise both with the couples that don’t get their deposit back and the suppliers that are unable to give them back. “I’ve tried my best where possible,we’ve had a cancellation, to give the deposit back because I know that this is just such a tough time for everybody. “I’m hoping in the long run that maybe I can get somebody  who has had to postpone that maybe hasn’t had a supplier available for their date. “Many depend on the bookings coming in. The furthest booking I have at the minute is in , so that’s two years away. “When you get that deposit through,that’s your livelihood, you’re not going to hold onto it for two years. I can understand the position some people are in.” Kirsty has been trying to give something back to key workers and NHS staff by offering them a discounted rate on their wedding music when things eventually settle down. While on lockdown-imposed hiatus, she has also been using the opportunity to upload more music to her Facebook page and develop her art. She said: “I don’t have that many covers or videos up on my page and I’m trying to get back into the swing of things and get more up. “Over the last two months, I haven’t really had any videos up, but I put up a cover of ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ the other day as a wee thank you. “The whole thing at the minute has been the rainbow pictures that kids have been painting – it’s been a symbol really for the tough times we’re going through. “There are a lot of negative things, soI can break that up with a song here and there, it might help matters.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With public gatherings still the subject of prohibitive legislation, the impact has been felt by many local suppliers of wedding music. Kirsty McKenna says the wave of postponements began when the British Prime Minister made his televised announcement on March . “When Boris Johnson had announced there were going to be restrictions put in place, everybody started to panic,” she told the County Derry Post. “Towards the end of March, I started to get messages from people saying they were going to have to postpone their wedding to a dferent date. googletag.cmd.push “I didn’t start getting actual rescheduled dates for a few weeks after that because there’s a lot going on. “Hotels are in a sticky situation too as they don’t know themselves when they’re going to be able to hold weddings again. Some people have postponed until a year after their original date. “It’s quite hard to get a wedding booked in, you nearly need it booked in a year and a half, or two years before your date, because of the high level of bookings people have.” As couples perform the logistical gymnastics required to reschedule their wedding, some will inevitably find that their preferred musician is unavailable for their refixed date. googletag.cmd.push This can result in some awkward conversationsa deposit has already been paid to a supplier, and Kirsty says finding a solution can be tough. “It’s a hard one, because for a lot of people, this is their only form of income,” said the Ballinascreen woman. “None of us saw this coming, so I can sympathise both with the couples that don’t get their deposit back and the suppliers that are unable to give them back. “I’ve tried my best where possible,we’ve had a cancellation, to give the deposit back because I know that this is just such a tough time for everybody. “I’m hoping in the long run that maybe I can get somebody  who has had to postpone that maybe hasn’t had a supplier available for their date. “Many depend on the bookings coming in. The furthest booking I have at the minute is in , so that’s two years away. “When you get that deposit through,that’s your livelihood, you’re not going to hold onto it for two years. I can understand the position some people are in.” Kirsty has been trying to give something back to key workers and NHS staff by offering them a discounted rate on their wedding music when things eventually settle down. While on lockdown-imposed hiatus, she has also been using the opportunity to upload more music to her Facebook page and develop her art. She said: “I don’t have that many covers or videos up on my page and I’m trying to get back into the swing of things and get more up. “Over the last two months, I haven’t really had any videos up, but I put up a cover of ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ the other day as a wee thank you. “The whole thing at the minute has been the rainbow pictures that kids have been painting – it’s been a symbol really for the tough times we’re going through. “There are a lot of negative things, soI can break that up with a song here and there, it might help matters.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is anticipated that with funding leveraged from partners and the private sector the final figure may sit closer to poundm. The local council has reiterated its plans to relocate to Foyle Street in order to make way for Ulster University expansion in the form of the Magee Medical School - one of the cornerstones of the City Deal. An Ulster University document shows an artists impression of an expanded Magee campusalong the riverfront. Earlier this week, Sinn Feacutein Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said she was ‘delighted’ that the Executive agreed to match fund Derry and Strabane’s City Deal Inclusive Future Fund. googletag.cmd.push The pound million is ‘transformative for Derry and the NW’, she said, and ‘goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community and business leaders.’ As far back as November , former SDLP MP for Foyle Mark Durkan raised the prospect of a City Deal for Derry. Speaking at Westminster at the time he said: “In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. “We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy.” googletag.cmd.push As it transpired, Belfast would be awarded Northern Ireland’s first City Deal as part of his Autumn budget in October . It is a year since the Derry region’s own deal was announced on May , . The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. Derry City  Strabane District Council has submitted all project proposals to government at this stage and the council continues to work with government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. Council relocation Welcoming the match funding announcement a council spokesperson said it was ‘hugely positive’ news for everyone involved in the project. She also confirmed that the council still plans on relocating from its headquarters on the Strand Road to Foyle Street car park adjacent to the Guildhall. However, the council previously made it clear that these proposals are dependent on a number of factors, including funding and are all at an early stage of development. Speaking yesterday a spokesperson said: “Work will progress over the coming weeks and months to advance and develop the regeneration projects earmarked for the match-funded Inclusive Future Fund that include the development of the Riverfront at Queen’s Quayand signature tourism projects , all of which are in the process of being scoped out and business cases prepared. “The proposed relocation of the Council offices still remains a key priority of the future planned expansion of the Ulster University and the development of the riverfront moving forward. “The Council will continue to work with Government and key partners to bring forward the City Deal to the next stage including the Heads of Terms and remains committed to developing the key catalyst regeneration projects that will bring about growth and prosperity for Derry and Strabane and the wider North West region.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ulster University is one of the main beneficiaries with pound earmarked for innovative research centres in personalised medicine and data analytics which are becoming ever more important in an increasingly technological world. These industries will shape future economies and healthcare. Healthcare research and treatments have been at the forefront of the COVID- pandemic. For example, personalised medicine is based on identying subgroups of patients with distinct mechanisms of disease or particular responses to treatments. Data analytics is another key component in the response of governments to the current crisis. googletag.cmd.push It involves analysing emerging data from countries around the world to identy the most important factors that can help slow the spread of the virus and help find long-term solutions to the pandemic. In the longer-term, data analytics will be well-placed to support Northern Ireland industry in the recovery process, post COVID-, by helping recovering NI businesses to improve their products and processes, develop new skills, unlock global opportunities and encourage collaboration across sectors. It’s understood that well-paid jobs created in these sectors would not be restricted to graduates but would benefit everyone in the city across the skills spectrum. Other headline investments are poundm for Derry’s riverfront and Queens Quay and Strabane town centre regeneration to the tune of poundm. googletag.cmd.push The figures below were outlined by Derry City  Strabane District Council at meetings last year. It is a rough guide but it’s understood that money allocated to dferent projects has altered which will be explained.  Ulster University- poundm UU has been allocated poundm, a considerable portion of the financial package. The university will contribute % towards the Magee projects. Of the overall amount, poundm will come from the UK Government’s City Deal funding and pound from the Inclusive Future fund to finance four dferent projects. Derry City  Strabane District councillors have repeatedly called on the university to show its commitment to the city by approving the graduate entry medical school and relocating its health science courses to Magee with a view to delivering on the promised , full-time students .  The core focus of the poundm City Deal funding remains the delivery of the centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation . Yesterday, UU confirmed that upon confirmation and approval of the business cases there will be further information with regard to student numbers, research posts and staff numbers. The Cognitive Analytics Research Lab or CARL is said to be a transformational new cutting-edge applied research centre based at Ulster University’s Magee campus. It will support Northern Ireland businesses to understand how data analytics and AI can benefit their business. CARL will work with sectors as erse as health, financial technology, media, energy and public policy. The centre will be a physical building where companies can work in close collaboration with UU researchers. CARL researchers will also work with entrepreneurs to develop new start-up companies. UU’s strong commercial focus has already led to the creation of numerous successful spin-out companies including ActionSENSE and AirBRIO and the award-winning wearable neurotechnology company NeuroCONCISE. It has been said that the CARL innovation centre would provide the city with global opportunities to become world class in areas such as software engineering, advanced networks and sensors, data analytics and cyber security and would offer huge potential to the city and wider region’s economic development. Another UU project, the Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automation  is an innovation centre which will support industry and commerce in Northern Ireland. It will help companies across all sectors with their digital technology agenda helping to improve innovation, productivity and competitiveness and adapt to Industry .. This state-of-the-art facility will be a dedicated space for demonstration, experimentation, and an industry hub. It will assist in skills development for local and international industry. Focussing on innovation and developing competitiveness when it is more pertinent than ever, the Centre will partner with local businesses to build capacity in their workforce. CIDRA will also play a key role in helping to attract new industry partners to locate in the city and region. During the COVID- crisis, members of Ulster University’s School of Computing, Engineering  Intelligent Systems who will be involved in CIDRA have been making face shields using D printing and laser cutting - , face shields have been safely delivered to primary care COVID- centres at Altnagelvin and local health centres. Currently, Ulster University’s School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems is collaborating with a local company Derry company to develop an automated face shield manufacturing line. CIDRA and CARL will be located in close proximity enabling potential for collaboration.  The Future Fund of poundm with joint funding from the NI government will be focused on advancing projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus and a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . It is hoped government approval for that project will be announced in the coming days. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, council-wide, multi-skills employment intervention support programme. It would expand upon the work of Altnagelvin based C-TRIC - a not-for-profit personalised medicine institute based on the Altnagelvin Area Hospital site which connects patients directly to research opportunities in the North West area and beyond. THRIVE proposes to have research centres for pediatric cancer and neuromuscular cancer amongst others. It will train the next generation of doctors and skilled staff in personalised medicine, health data analytics, healthcare policy and economics. C-TRIC and THRIVE are viewed as the research arm of the proposed Medical School.  Queens Quay Derry riverfront projects - poundm Future Fund match funding of poundm had previously been allocated to this project. The council now says that this project will receive approximately poundm but it is unclear where the outstanding poundm will be redirected.  Key tourism, economic, and social projects and initiatives - poundm Last year the council said that signature tourism projects will be allocated poundm. It now says these projects will be allocated poundm but did not state to which project the other poundm will be awarded.  Digital SMART cities - poundm A report to council previously stated that poundm would be set aside for digital SMART city projects. All over the world, rapid urbanisation is putting enormous stress on resources and infrastructure which cannot be solved in a traditional way. The Smart Cities agenda recognises that cities and regions grapple with many of the same issues - traffic congestion, air quality, inadequate energy, poor management of the environment, climate change, and data privacy, etc. and that there are signicant opportunities to share learning. The transition to smart places requires government, citizens, the business community and wider civil society working in synergy so that the effective interplay between policy and innovation meets the needs of citizens. A council spokesperson previously said: “If we reflect on the past decade, the way we live, conduct business, and interact and engage with each other has changed dramatically. “Yet, we are only at the beginning of a digital change that will transform our societies. Local government has a key role to play in harnessing the smart city opportunity, making cities more liveable and creative, improving services, competitiveness and standards, embracing technology and innovation, maximising the potential of the mountains of data generated, and facilitating a convergence of digital infrastructure with physical development.”  Skills- poundm Derry City  Strabane District Council has earmarked poundm for skills but did not provide any further detail.  Strabane town centre regeneration - poundm Match funding of poundm from the NI Government will be used to fund this project.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As we all know, we must only leave our homeswe are key workers or cannot work from home, to do essential shopping and for one period of daily exercise. By doing this we will all help protect the NHS and save lives. Despite the absolutely necessary restrictions on our normal lives, people are being encouraged to help neighbours in need where possible. This has led to some amazing acts of kindness on every street, in every village and town across the country. googletag.cmd.push Communities have never felt stronger. Today, we shine a light on just some of the people from communities across the country to showcase examples of ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind and helpful things. CASE STUDY GAIL REDMOND  GAIL REDMOND: ‘Dromore area hit hard by redundancies’ Charity that supports families has noticed a sharp rise in requests for help due to widespread redundancies. Gail Redmond of Via Wings’ in the County Down town of Dromore, in Northern Ireland, says the charity normally gives out  food bags a month to people in need. “But last week we gave out  already, many of which are going to people who are self-isolating,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “One guy who contacted me on Friday, said: I have never asked anyone for help like this before. But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs. “We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’. “The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.” Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-. Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge. Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies. “Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added. “There is no ownership, we are just working together.” CASE STUDY NEIL MUSGROVE  MARATHON MAN: Neil Musgrove putting his best foot forward for an ultra marathon in his back garden in Leeds PIC- NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARES An ultra-marathon runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed. Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden. He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra-marathon by the end of April. For every mile completed, Neil is donating pound to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed. He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances. “It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes, it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile. “My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully, lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two-metre rule.” All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals. This includes paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards.

CASE STUDY STENHOUSEMUIR FC  ABOVE: ON THE BALL: Stenhousemuir FC players and coaching staff BELOW: HOME ADVANTAGE: Stenhousemuir players brought food directly to people’s houses  A football club initiative is supporting hundreds of families by delivering school meals to pupils during the coronavirus lockdown. With the season shut down indefinitely, Stenhousemuir FC set up its community help hotline in mid-March to assist the most vulnerable members of society as the effects of the global pandemic began to take hold. A -strong squad of volunteers was assembled in the first week to carry out everyday tasks like shopping or dog walking for those in isolation or for whom such activities would prove dficult. Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome. Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead. The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home. Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move. On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren. Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging. “We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay. “The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody . “We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call. “We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.” Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community. When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future. “It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this. “However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities. “The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.” CASE STUDY HARRY RAGLESS  ABOVE: WALKING TALL: Harry Ragless has raised pound, with the help of his father and his walking frame and leg supports BELOW: STAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit  A boy with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community - but in completely dferent ways. Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet. But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around poundmillion for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports. The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised pound, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts - smashing his pound target. He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.” His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.” As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk. She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.” In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself - and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page. Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community. By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager - but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.” The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs. He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.” Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him. In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events. When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry. When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.” To donate, visit www.justgiving fundraising selina-ragless.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

In a decade that was dominated by Ballinderry and Slaughtneil, it will come as no surprise that players from both squads feature heavily in this selection. Five clubs in total are represented. . Michael Conlan  Mickey C, as he is affectionately known, was a player who maintained high levels of consistency for many years. As the years progressed, all aspects of his game got better, a result of endless hours of hard-work and an inner drive to be the best he could be. He was a pivotal figure in the Shamrocks famous three in a-row success. googletag.cmd.push . Paul McNeill  An exceptional corner-back who possesses all the qualities required to defend in the modern game. He is quick, tenacious, rarely fouls and very good on the ball. Extremely disciplined and a real team player. Still more to come from him and I expect to see him become a permanent fixture in defence for the county team. . Brendan Rogers  One of the best club full-backs I have witnessed. He is extremely athletic and his ability to carry the ball - yards out of defence on a consistent basis is a real plus for Slaughtneil. His performance against Ballinderry in last year’s quarter-final was one of the best I have seen from any club player to date. googletag.cmd.push . Karl McKaigue  Completing the full-back line is Slaughtneil’s Mr Consistency. Always handed the job of snuffing out the oppositions best forward, a task he completes on most occasions with relative ease. He is also very comfortable on the ball and has the ability to get vital scores on days when the forwards are perhaps not firing on all cylinders. . Kevin McGuckin  Was a key figure for Ballinderry in their championship successes in ,  and . As the years progressed, he moved from his natural corner-back position to featuring regularly in the half-back line and midfield. An excellent reader of the game, who is always assured when in possession. A natural leader who will leave a big hole when he decides to retire. . Chrissy McKaigue A central figure in their domination of Derry and Ulster club football from -. A highly driven inidual who strives for perfection. Like many of his team-mates, possesses excellent athletic ability and he uses this to constantly put opposing teams on the back foot. . Barry McGoldrick  One of the leaders for Coleraine when they landed their first senior title in  and in their more recent success of , he was still the main driving force. A strong presence, an excellent reader of the game and very clever in how he uses the ball. Very good at organising those around him. . Fergal Doherty  Even though he last played championship in , his performances for Bellaghy in the earlier part of the decade were of the highest level. Hard as nails, an absolute warrior in every sense of the word. His ability to compete for kick-outs meant that most opposition teams lost the midfield battle. Phenomenal stamina and a superb kick-passer, he really was the complete midfielder. . Patsy Bradley  Could have copied and pasted what I have written for Fergal, such are the similarities between both players. A very quiet player on the pitch who let his playing do the talking. Strong in possession and always extremely disciplined. A leader on and off the pitch. When he decides to retire, Slaughtneil will find it almost impossible to replace him. . Niall Holly  Whilst he played most of his football from midfield, he did have spells in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball whose direct running causes endless problems for opposing defences. Very strong in possession and as the years have progressed, has become a much better decision-maker. Even when subjected to constant abuse, he shows exemplary discipline. . Sean Leo McGoldrick  Another superb footballer who managed to maintain very high standards for many years. A play-maker whose vision made him stand out anytime you watched Coleraine play. Extremely versatile, intelligent and could play any position from –. Not afraid of hard-work and a real team player. A joy to watch. . Enda Muldoon  Could have selected Enda in any position from - and whilst he was an exceptional midfielder, he did play a lot of club football in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball, superb kick-passer and accurate free taker. Enda had it all and when it was required, he could demonstrate his physical capabilities. A once in a letime footballer. . Shane McGuigan  Has the ability to win his own ball and always makes himself available. Willing to make unselfish runs for others and when not in possession has an appetite for hard-work. Extremely accurate from play and frees. Displays a level maturity well beyond his young years. There is still much more to come from him in the next decade. . Benny Heron  Always produces the goods for Screen. Was the main man in their journey to county finals in  and . He makes intelligent runs and in big championship games he quite often has the company of two defenders, but yet still manages to exert an influence on proceedings. Very accurate from play and frees and has the composure to take goal chances when they appear. . Conleith Gilligan  Up until the end of , Deets continued to torture opposing defences. Not only is he quick off the mark but his runs are also intelligent and this makes him more dficult to track. Very comfortable on the ball and possesses extreme accuracy in front of goal. As well as my team selection, the following deserve special mention and were strong contenders: Antoacutein McMullan– a great shot stopper who very rarely wastes a kick-out and just missed out behind Michael Conlan. Collie McVey– a superb man-marker who never received the recognition he deserved and is edged out by Paul McNeill. Connor Nevin– a superb player for Ballinderry and Barry McGoldrick was picked ahead of him. Darren Conway– a vital cog for Ballinderrywho always produced the goods in the championship. Niall Holly was chosen ahead of him. Colm McGoldrick– a man who consistently performs at a high level and was central to Coleraine’s success. Just lost out to Benny Heron.

In a decade that was dominated by Ballinderry and Slaughtneil, it will come as no surprise that players from both squads feature heavily in this selection. Five clubs in total are represented. . Michael Conlan  Mickey C, as he is affectionately known, was a player who maintained high levels of consistency for many years. As the years progressed, all aspects of his game got better, a result of endless hours of hard-work and an inner drive to be the best he could be. He was a pivotal figure in the Shamrocks famous three in a-row success. googletag.cmd.push . Paul McNeill  An exceptional corner-back who possesses all the qualities required to defend in the modern game. He is quick, tenacious, rarely fouls and very good on the ball. Extremely disciplined and a real team player. Still more to come from him and I expect to see him become a permanent fixture in defence for the county team. . Brendan Rogers  One of the best club full-backs I have witnessed. He is extremely athletic and his ability to carry the ball - yards out of defence on a consistent basis is a real plus for Slaughtneil. His performance against Ballinderry in last year’s quarter-final was one of the best I have seen from any club player to date. googletag.cmd.push . Karl McKaigue  Completing the full-back line is Slaughtneil’s Mr Consistency. Always handed the job of snuffing out the oppositions best forward, a task he completes on most occasions with relative ease. He is also very comfortable on the ball and has the ability to get vital scores on days when the forwards are perhaps not firing on all cylinders. . Kevin McGuckin  Was a key figure for Ballinderry in their championship successes in ,  and . As the years progressed, he moved from his natural corner-back position to featuring regularly in the half-back line and midfield. An excellent reader of the game, who is always assured when in possession. A natural leader who will leave a big hole when he decides to retire. . Chrissy McKaigue A central figure in their domination of Derry and Ulster club football from -. A highly driven inidual who strives for perfection. Like many of his team-mates, possesses excellent athletic ability and he uses this to constantly put opposing teams on the back foot. . Barry McGoldrick  One of the leaders for Coleraine when they landed their first senior title in  and in their more recent success of , he was still the main driving force. A strong presence, an excellent reader of the game and very clever in how he uses the ball. Very good at organising those around him. . Fergal Doherty  Even though he last played championship in , his performances for Bellaghy in the earlier part of the decade were of the highest level. Hard as nails, an absolute warrior in every sense of the word. His ability to compete for kick-outs meant that most opposition teams lost the midfield battle. Phenomenal stamina and a superb kick-passer, he really was the complete midfielder. . Patsy Bradley  Could have copied and pasted what I have written for Fergal, such are the similarities between both players. A very quiet player on the pitch who let his playing do the talking. Strong in possession and always extremely disciplined. A leader on and off the pitch. When he decides to retire, Slaughtneil will find it almost impossible to replace him. . Niall Holly  Whilst he played most of his football from midfield, he did have spells in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball whose direct running causes endless problems for opposing defences. Very strong in possession and as the years have progressed, has become a much better decision-maker. Even when subjected to constant abuse, he shows exemplary discipline. . Sean Leo McGoldrick  Another superb footballer who managed to maintain very high standards for many years. A play-maker whose vision made him stand out anytime you watched Coleraine play. Extremely versatile, intelligent and could play any position from –. Not afraid of hard-work and a real team player. A joy to watch. . Enda Muldoon  Could have selected Enda in any position from - and whilst he was an exceptional midfielder, he did play a lot of club football in the half-forward line. An excellent fielder of the ball, superb kick-passer and accurate free taker. Enda had it all and when it was required, he could demonstrate his physical capabilities. A once in a letime footballer. . Shane McGuigan  Has the ability to win his own ball and always makes himself available. Willing to make unselfish runs for others and when not in possession has an appetite for hard-work. Extremely accurate from play and frees. Displays a level maturity well beyond his young years. There is still much more to come from him in the next decade. . Benny Heron  Always produces the goods for Screen. Was the main man in their journey to county finals in  and . He makes intelligent runs and in big championship games he quite often has the company of two defenders, but yet still manages to exert an influence on proceedings. Very accurate from play and frees and has the composure to take goal chances when they appear. . Conleith Gilligan  Up until the end of , Deets continued to torture opposing defences. Not only is he quick off the mark but his runs are also intelligent and this makes him more dficult to track. Very comfortable on the ball and possesses extreme accuracy in front of goal. As well as my team selection, the following deserve special mention and were strong contenders: Antoacutein McMullan– a great shot stopper who very rarely wastes a kick-out and just missed out behind Michael Conlan. Collie McVey– a superb man-marker who never received the recognition he deserved and is edged out by Paul McNeill. Connor Nevin– a superb player for Ballinderry and Barry McGoldrick was picked ahead of him. Darren Conway– a vital cog for Ballinderrywho always produced the goods in the championship. Niall Holly was chosen ahead of him. Colm McGoldrick– a man who consistently performs at a high level and was central to Coleraine’s success. Just lost out to Benny Heron.

The news was outlined in a statement from the companys chief executive officer, Damian McGloughlin. In March, Homebase was classied as an essential retailer by the Government, meaning that our stores could continue trading.

Following a successful trial across  stores, we will be fully reopening an additional  stores across the UK on Wednesday th April, with strict controls in place to ensure shopping is safe for everyone. Our remaining UK stores will all be reopened for customers to browse and shop from Saturday nd May.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Primary  pupils at New Row Primary School were set to celebrate the sacrament at the weekend but Covid- regulations meant the ceremony had to be postponed. In a letter to parents last week, P teacher Emer Scullion and Principal Deirdre Graffin stressed that the ceremony had not been cancelled. “Remember – First Communion is postponed – not cancelled,” it read. “Cancelled means it would never happen again and the chance for it to happen has passed. However, you will celebrate your FirstCommunion. googletag.cmd.push  “So,anyone said they are sorry your First Communion has been cancelled, you cansay that it hasn’t – it’s just postponed until another time.” Fr Gates and Fr Branigan of Magherafelt Parish offered to remember all the children in Saturday’s am mass, just when their First Communion would have been beginning. Children all sent a photo that was placed around the altar and were able to watch with their families at home via the parish webcam while taking part in the mass. Mrs Graffin urged the children to stay positive. She said: “This is a lovely reminder that we have not forgotten about special times in our lives and that like so many other things, this is just postponed. googletag.cmd.push “Although we don’t know exactly what the future holds, it will become clear.

EJB Car Sales Ltd took the decision to raffle the car after one their social media manager, Christine Orr fell ill with Covid- and experienced the care and attention of the healthcare staff. Owner Eamon Bradley said the idea originally came up while Christine was still in hospital. “She was admitted to the Altnagelvin Covid ward and was totally beside herself,” said the Garvagh man. “Whenever she was there, she got us the names of  nurses here and Jim’s we works in Coleraine, so she got us  names from the Coleraine ward. googletag.cmd.push “We were originally going to raffle a weekend away, but then we thought, ‘why don’t we go one better ’ and we decided to put the car up for raffle.” With all  staff safely into the draw, the raffle took place on Sunday evening with Dungiven native Maureen McGinnis taking home the Chevrolet . Spark.  The gesture comes after the company offered the use of a courtesy car for NHS staff last month in an effort to make their lives ‘a bit easier’. Eamon told the County Derry Post that he wanted to do all he could to help. “Those men and women are going onto what is classed as the front line, to save maybe a relation of mine or anybody,” he said. googletag.cmd.push Eamon’s brother Jim, whose we Nicola works in the Intensive Care Unit at Causeway Hospital, also weighed in by running a one-man marathon to raise over pound, to purchase equipment for the NHS.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Four of the main supermarket chains in N. Ireland have agreed with the Department for Communities to prioritise delivery slots for people who cannot get out to access food after receiving shielding letters from their GP asking them to isolate at home. The supermarkets involved are Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Iceland. Those eligible should sign up online at www.nidirect.gov.uk services register-priority-online-food-delivery googletag.cmd.push The Department will check eligibility and share details with the supermarkets who will contact customers directly to advise when delivery slots are available. Mayor Boyle said the scheme would help alleviate pressures on Councils and Community groups delivering emergency food aid on the ground, and urged anyone eligible to sign up. “I am delighted to see the major supermarkets supporting the Department and local Communities in their efforts to supply emergency food aid to those who are most at risk from Covid-. There are people who are unable leave their homes at all and who may not have family or friends to help with shopping. They are reliant on online services and this will greatly assist them to maintain shielding and protect themselves at this time of risk. googletag.cmd.push “The Department have been offering aid through their emergency Food Box scheme but this service is under increasing pressure, and these priority delivery slots will help alleviate some of that pressure. Some people who have signed up to the Food Box Scheme due to lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots may find their needs are now met through this scheme, freeing up food box availability for others. “I would really encourage anyone who is eligible – namely those who are shielding at home on the instruction of their GP, who don’t have other means of obtaining food – to submit their details.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Four of the main supermarket chains in N. Ireland have agreed with the Department for Communities to prioritise delivery slots for people who cannot get out to access food after receiving shielding letters from their GP asking them to isolate at home. The supermarkets involved are Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Iceland. Those eligible should sign up online at www.nidirect.gov.uk services register-priority-online-food-delivery googletag.cmd.push The Department will check eligibility and share details with the supermarkets who will contact customers directly to advise when delivery slots are available. Mayor Boyle said the scheme would help alleviate pressures on Councils and Community groups delivering emergency food aid on the ground, and urged anyone eligible to sign up. “I am delighted to see the major supermarkets supporting the Department and local Communities in their efforts to supply emergency food aid to those who are most at risk from Covid-. There are people who are unable leave their homes at all and who may not have family or friends to help with shopping. They are reliant on online services and this will greatly assist them to maintain shielding and protect themselves at this time of risk. googletag.cmd.push “The Department have been offering aid through their emergency Food Box scheme but this service is under increasing pressure, and these priority delivery slots will help alleviate some of that pressure. Some people who have signed up to the Food Box Scheme due to lack of availability of supermarket delivery slots may find their needs are now met through this scheme, freeing up food box availability for others. “I would really encourage anyone who is eligible – namely those who are shielding at home on the instruction of their GP, who don’t have other means of obtaining food – to submit their details.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have

The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In

run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help.

He is disappointed at having to postpone his trip, but says itrsquos better to remain in New York.Tommy, who is a treasurer of a global finance company, usually commutes by subway into the heart of the Big Apple each day. However, since the city went into lockdown on March , Tommy has been self-isolating at home with his girlfriend, Lia.The former Crew Road resident has been living in New York since ,after he completed his Masters degree at Queenrsquos University Belfast, and says he only intended staying for six weeks.That same year he flew to Dublin on September  mdash the same day as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which he and friends had visited the previous day.ldquoWe had taken pictures with the security guards and other workers and it still haunts me wonderingthose guys were able to make it out alive, he says.Tommy says that  years on fear has ed to the streets of New York.ldquoAt the beginning of the pandemic back in early March our company was swt to respond. We put social distancing measures in place and rotated staff on a sht basis so that only a third of workers were in the office each day.ldquoWe knew the virus was going to get more severe so after we learned the St Patrickrsquos Day parade was to be cancelled we took that as a signal and mandated that all staff should stay at home.Tommy says the sweeping changes have left an eerie feeling in their wake.ldquoIn the first few weeks the only workers that remained in the city centre were builders availing of free movement and the empty streets to get ahead with development projects, but they too were forced to quit, he said.ldquoTraffic has all but ceased, apart from a few ambulances and delivery trucks.ldquoThe economic impact of coronavirus has been devastating, particularly for the Irish who have found themselves furloughed off, out of work and not entitled to any government aid.ldquoA charity has been set up called Slainte  which was formed with the sole intention of alleviating the suffering that many have been going through and to help those less fortunate to get through it.Tommy is also a leading figure in the GAA in New York which is supporting Slainte .At the weekend local Gaelic footballers in the city ran a combined distance of , kilometres, which is the equivalent of running theof Ireland, from Malin Head in Donegal to Mizzen Head in Cork mdash and back.The event was in place of a cancelled Gaelic football tournament and all proceeds went to Slainte .ldquoOver half of the people who have applied for help from Slainte  are in the hospitality industry which looks to be one of the last groups that willto work in all likelihood.ldquoThere is also a lot of great work being done by other Irish community groups in New York.Tommy says it is very encouraging to see the Irish community pull together during a time like this.He said: ldquoThe Irish are renowned for putting their shoulder to the wheel in times of adversity and the last few weeks have been no dferent.ldquoWersquore looking after each other as we always have done when hardship strikes.Tommy says people can still make donations to Slainte  by going to the link www.slainte.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17333834.the-buzz-of-the-farmers-mart/resources/images/11316846.jpg","title":"mart holds online cattle sale buyers homes","story":"It is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.
