Britons are predicted to spend £2.44billion in the Black Friday sales today, as shoppers battle it for cut-price TVs and electrical goods          People queue up at the HMV store before the opening during the Black Friday sales in Oxford Street in London this morning          There were some early-morning Black Friday shoppers battling for deals first thing today, as shown in Newcastle at a Tesco, shortly after it opened its doors at 5am  Online shoppers boasted on social media about the purchases they had made on Black Friday, during which Brits are expected to splurge £2.5billion           Shoppers in Birmingham enjoy the first of a four-day weekend in which retailers slash prices in a bid to tempt customers into spending ahead of Christmas          Bargain hunters who headed straight to the electronics aisle at Tesco in Newcastle this morning to buy an Xbox were left disappointed when it appeared only six games were on sale          A member of GMB, the union for Amazon workers, stages a protest  at the Amazon Swansea fulfillment centreMeanwhile, unions in Britain will stage protests at five sites to complain about safety conditions. Amazon said the safety record at its warehouses is above the industry average. Protests were also reported or due in France and Germany.While Black Friday discounts have traditionally been a U.S. retail event, companies have increasingly been offering discounts in other countries, too.          Members and supporters of the GMB union protest outside the Amazon offices  in Milton Keynes                                                    Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027. \u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027          People queue up outside Foot Locker before opening during the Black Friday sales in Oxford Street, London this morning            Early-morning risers queue outside Foot Locker in Birmingham\u0027s main shopping centre, the Bullring, which is set for an incredibly busy day          Shoppers are taking advantage of the annual Black Friday sales early this morning, with this couple pictured walking out of the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester          Thousands braved the near-freezing conditions overnight to queue outside stores up and down the country, including Tesco in Newcastle, to beat other shoppers to the biggest discounts          A shopper heads back home after a particularly early start this morning to pick up a new television from Tesco Extra in Gorton, Manchester          Stacked televisions are pictured ahead of doors opening at a Tesco in Newcastle. Britain\u0027s retailers are hoping Black Friday discounts will get shoppers spending again after a torrid year for much of the sector          Shoppers eagerly await entry to the Tesco Extra store in Gorton, Manchester. According to researcher Springboard, footfall on the main shopping streets is anticipated to drop versus 2017, while online transactions are forecast to rise          Some of the best deals had already sold out before much of the UK had even woken up this morning, with retailers starting their offers overnight (electronics retailer GAME was already sold out of its Nintendo Switch and two game deal this morning)          Bargain-hungry Brits leave a Tesco in Manchester with a new TV.

Black Friday fever has swept the nation this morning, as bargain hunters sharpen their elbows to snap up discounted goods   Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u0027Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and we\u0027ve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important \u0027golden quarter\u0027.\u0027Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it.\u0027However, consumer group Which? said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in 10 Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year.It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \u0027While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, it\u0027s clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear.\u0027To bag a bargain, do your research and don\u0027t get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales.\u0027  Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK.Consumers will spend £2.4 billion on deals in stores and online, down from last year\u0027s £2.6 billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Research (CRR) and VoucherCodes.co.uk.Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this year\u0027s Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and significant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month.According to KPMG\u0027s study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with 75 per cent of shoppers aged 18 to 24 saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to 36 per cent of 45 to 54 year olds, and just 24 per cent of over 55s.Mr Martin added: \u0027Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out.\u0027Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in 2013, retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Keeley Hawes 42 portray sophisticated beauty pageant boss","story":"    Keeley Hawes, pictured, plays Julia Morley in a movie adaptation of the 1970 Miss World Competition in London Keeley Hawes played the Home Secretary in hit BBC1 drama Bodyguard, but she will have a much more global and glamorous role in a film that’s about to go before the cameras.She will portray Miss World executive Julia Morley, sometimes known as Mrs World, in a film set during the 1970 contest held at the Royal Albert Hall, when a group of ‘Women’s Libbers’ dropped flour bombs on to the stage.The protest caused compere Bob Hope to run to the wings.

Porn star Susie Best was paid for sex by bankers who committed a huge fraud that Mr Edmonds was a victim ofEmployee Lynden Scourfield, who was jailed for 11 years in 2017, enjoyed luxury holidays, trips on banker accomplice David Mills\u0027 superyacht and sex with porn stars including escort Suzie Best.Noel is pursuing Lloyds for losses allegedly suffered when his former business Unique Group was destroyed because of the fraud.Jonathan Coad, solicitor for Mr Edmonds, on Thursday served Lloyds with a pre-case letter, needed to initiate formal proceedings which could begin as soon as December.Mr Edmonds has suggested that Mr Horta Osorio knew about the misdeeds of staff at HBOS, and on Wednesday claimed that the bank boss \u0027wants to destroy me, he wants to crush me\u0027.He also said that other Lloyds board members are at risk of police action over the case.\u0027There are members of the board who are really worried about what is really going on and there are senior executives who don\u0027t want to have their collars felt. They don\u0027t won\u0027t to be implicated when the warrants start to arrive, and they will arrive,\u0027 he said.For its part, Lloyds has rejected the basis of Mr Edmonds\u0027 claim.A Lloyds spokesman said: \u0027We are still waiting for Mr Edmonds to file his legal claim. If he does file his claim, it will be contested.\u0027Mr Coad, of Keystone Law, said: \u0027I have never been involved in a case where so much meticulous effort has been invested by so many to professionals to prepare a claim.\u0027In this case we have had first to unpick a sophisticated fraud, and then piece it together using primarily documentary evidence, but also some key evidence from witnesses to what was going on at the time.\u0027          Mr Edmonds admits his motivation to go into the Jungle is to hit Lloyds and he insists he\u0027ll win          Mark Dobson, 56, helped to ert funds from two high-risk clients to Mills\u0027 bogus businesses in return for £30,000 and lavish hospitality.He had to chase the fraudster repeatedly before receiving a suspicious bundle of documents that contained \u0027no evidence of appropriate sanctioning\u0027 in January 2007.A month later HBOS carried out a review of 38 struggling businesses that had received irregular loans from IA and together owed the bank £375million.The conclusion was damning: the bank stood to lose up to £288million from companies that had engaged QCS under Scourfield\u0027s supervision.Mr Angus confronted the conman with the findings at the bank\u0027s Bishopsgate office on 8 March 2007 - but within hours he went off sick with \u0027work-related stress\u0027 and never returned.HBOS suspended Scourfield for gross misconduct and he resigned in April 2007.The former banking giant carried out two further investigations but neither one uncovered the \u0027true nature\u0027 of Scourfield\u0027s corrupt relationship with Mills.Prosecutor Brian O\u0027Neill QC said: \u0027Some other employees of the Bank do not emerge well from the investigation, most particularly Paul Burnett, who was Scourfield\u0027s immediate line manager.\u0027There is little doubt that his apparent lack of oversight was partly responsible for Scourfield\u0027s ability to act in the way that he did and for as long as he did.\u0027He continued: \u0027Had Burnett and others paid closer attention to the crib sheet figures, Scourfield\u0027s activities may have been identified sooner..\u0027Burnett lost his position at the Bank as a result of his failures as a manager.\u0027Jurors were told \u0027systems and processes undoubtedly contributed to Scourfield\u0027s ability to behave dishonestly\u0027 as he began \u0027exploiting systemic and personnel weaknesses which he knew to exist\u0027.But Mr O\u0027Neill insisted there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 Mr Burnett or any other HBOS employees were complicit in the conspiracy, and said the bank wasn\u0027t \u0027knowingly turning a blind eye\u0027 to the con.THE FINANCIAL CRASHHBOS, once the UK\u0027s biggest mortgage lender, suffered a devastating collapse during the credit crunch - and taxpayers were left to foot the £20.5billion bill.The banking giant was formed by the 2001 merger of Halifax and The Bank of Scotland and loaned £435billion within seven years as it pursued an aggressive expansion plan.But it lost £10.8billion in 2008 as profits plunged by 70 per cent when the credit crunch hit.Gordon Brown\u0027s Labour government quickly issued a £20.5billion bailout package to fix HBOS\u0027s massive funding gap and avoid a \u0027banking meltdown\u0027.The Banking Standards Commission later slammed HBOS bosses for \u0027catastrophic failings\u0027 and a \u0027colossal failure of management\u0027.Former CEO James Crosby, the \u0027architect\u0027 of HBOS\u0027s failed strategy, forfeited the knighthood he was granted for \u0027services to the finance industry\u0027 after leaving the bank for a senior FSA role in 2006.Mr Crosby, thought to draw more than £400,000 a year from his HBOS pension, said he was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for the disaster.In 2012 HBOS senior executive Peter Cummings was fined £500,000 and banned from banking for life by the FSA for his part in the bank\u0027s near-collapse.Mr Cummings retired in 2009 with a £352,000 a year pension after making his name by lending to high-profile clients including Top Shop founder Philip Green.Lloyds Bank acquired HBOS in January 2009 as part of the rescue package.Amid the chaos, Lloyds instructed Deloitte to investigate Scourfield\u0027s activity after the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority) issued a requirement notice.The criminal investigation didn\u0027t begin until after the report, dubbed Project Windsor, was completed in 2010.THE VICTIMSThe 2010 report revealed that of the £250million written off by HBOS\u0027s IA ision, £245million related to customers under Scourfield\u0027s management.Nearly all of them had engaged QCS\u0027s \u0027consultancy services\u0027.Businesses that fell prey to the criminal plot include golf equipment firm Seoul Nassau, fishing tackle company Sharpe\u0027s Holdings, aviation group Corporate Jet Services (who owned Club 328 and Euromanx), textile business Magenta, restaurant and nightclub operator the Mezzanine Group, and Remnant Media, a company setup to buy porn mags including Asian Babes.HBOS began legal action against some of the clients, including couple Paul and Nikki Turner, who ran Cambridge-based music publisher Zenith before it was destroyed by Scourfield\u0027s scam.The bank took the Turners to court more than 15 times in an unsuccessful attempt to evict them after Scourfield devastated their business.Oxfordshire farmer Justin Riggs, 57, said his livelihood was \u0027annihilated\u0027 when Scourfield authorised a £375,000 loan and advised him to sell land and chicken coops in 2004.The farmer was forced to remortgage his house when his loan rose by £7,000 after he had paid £231,000 in interest and fees.Mr Riggs\u0027 plight was discussed in parliament in 2009 as MP Ed Vaizey noted: \u0027There is a pattern in the way that Mr Scourfield engaged numerous people.\u0027He has taken businesses and loaded them with loans, charges and consultancy fees. It\u0027s now up to HBOS to come to the table.\u0027THE INVESTIGATIONThe six-year investigation, dubbed Operation Hornet, was \u0027the most complex and far-reaching\u0027 fraud case in Thames Valley Police\u0027s history, involving 120 officers.

I liked the fact that a success story like Elton\u0027s can start with something as simple as receiving a piano. But if John Lewis knocked on my door tomorrow and said would you want to make next year\u0027s film, I would obviously snap it up in an instant.\u0027 Thousands of commenters praised the video online and admitted that it had reduced them to tears.           Mr Beastall, a professional videographer, dedicated the emotive video to the selflessness of his partner of ten years Claire Higley, the mother of their children Ethan, Eliza and Zara. (The couple are pictured together)Most touchingly, he received messages of thanks from parents who have lost a child and also children whose parents are no longer alive as the video had had a positive impact on them.Mr Beastall said: \u0027A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing. I never expected that at all. To think people are getting so much from my film. I am blown away.\u0027 He made the video in 2014 but was inspired to share it again now after seeing the Elton John advert on TV. While the John Lewis ad showcases the goal-driven, hectic world around us, Mr Beastall hopes his video encourages those who watch it to appreciate every day they have with family. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/21/06/5179286900000578-0-image-a-13_1540101440616.jpg","title":"Team GB gymnast set new Guinness World Record longest flip horizontal bars","story":"    Ashley Watson back-flipped once in the air as he covered a distance of nearly 20 feet to claim the new world record           The Team GB gymnast  three times in the air to build up momentum and flipped through the air to complete the acrobatic manoeuvre As he gripped the second bars he then  twice before landing the world-beating manoeuvre on a gym mat.When he successfully landed the attempt Watson held his hands in the air and said, \u0027come on, that was so clean\u0027.He set the new record at Leeds Gymnastics Club yesterday, with two independent witnesses watching and a chartered surveyor to measure the distance.The 26-year-old, who has been in the Great Britain squad since he was 15, succeeded on his eighth attempt, and said he was \u0027surprised no-one had tried it before\u0027.Watson said he actually set a new record on his sixth attempt but deleted it from Instagram because it did not look good enough on film because one of his legs was bent.           Watson grabbed the second set of horizontal bars and  twice in the air before landing on the gym mat          As Watson landed the jump he held his hands in the air in triumph and said \u0027come on, that was so clean\u0027It\u0027s a Kind of Tragic!

Twitter users snipe and despair at Black Friday madness as bargain hunters battle for deals online and in stores across UKSocial media is awash with memes, outrage and excitement today as Black Friday frenzy sweeps the UK.Shoppers up and down the country have been sent into a frenzy as they sharpen their elbows and scramble to snap up bargains.And they are taking to Twitter to flaunt their bargains and joke about their suffering bank balances amid millions being spend on the High Street and online.More than two fifths of Britons are planning to spend in the Black Friday sales today amid warnings not to \u0027get carried away by the hype\u0027.Some 42 per cent of Britons are looking forward to the event, and 22 per cent are specifically looking to buy Christmas presents - while 25 per cent are intending to shop on Cyber Monday, a survey by KPMG suggests.

Mrs Bulman, left, and with her husband James, right, said the incident had left her feeling \u0027disgusted, filthy and disappointed\u0027But 18 months ago Sharon started to become suspicious of his reasons for being helpful.She said: \u0027The first time I wondered what was going on was one day that he was in having a coffee and I went upstairs to change into my running gear which was laid out on the landing.\u0027As I got ready I saw movement and caught sight of Steve running down the stairs. He later explained that he had gone up to look at our carpet which we\u0027d had cleaned but now of course I believe differently.\u0027On another day as I was driving out of the estate I looked in my car\u0027s rear view mirror and got a shock because I thought I saw a figure standing in our house.\u0027James also caught Steve leaving our back gate with a can of WD40 and he said he looked very sheepish. He hurriedly explained to James that I\u0027d been complaining about the back door squeaking.  Gill wanders over to the window to draw the curtains, and then is filmed peering outside\u0027I\u0027d said no such thing and we became convinced something was going on but I didn\u0027t know what, although I suspected he might be looking in my underwear drawer.\u0027I started deliberately leaving it slightly open and sure enough when I would get home it would be shut so someone had to be in there tampering with it.\u0027I would very often get texts from Steve saying: \u0027Hello lovely Sharon, when do you think you\u0027ll be getting home?\u0027\u0027At the time I didn\u0027t think much of it, just that he was being friendly, but again it makes sense now because he wanted to know how much time he had undisturbed in our house.\u0027Once we really strongly suspected him James bought a camera from Argos and I hid it inside a cushion which had an owl on it.

It looked like something he\u0027d become used to doing.\u0027Whilst he was doing what he did he was watching and rewinding a video on his phone. You can see the screen on the video and it appears to be a video of me just talking and close up.\u0027The whole thing is really creepy and unsettling, he was given a key because he offered to help us while we were on holiday in Cyprus but he\u0027s abused our trust in the worst possible way.          Married HGV driver Gill then grabbed one of Sharon\u0027s pop socks from an underwear drawer (pictured) before he committed a sex act\u0027Lots of people rely on good neighbours for help but you never expect someone to do something so horrible, it\u0027s been really hard to deal with.\u0027Gill admitting burglary and stalking, but dodged prison because he had never been in trouble before and being locked up would have an impact on his two sons and mother.The court heard that his wife is standing by him. She was in the public gallery, and was one of a number of family and friends to write a letter of support for the judge to read. He was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, ordered to go on a sex offenders\u0027 treatment programme, do 150 hours of unpaid work, pay £200 costs and £500 compensation to Sharon. Describing the offences of burglary and stalking as \u0027highly unusual examples\u0027, Judge Peter Armstrong told him: \u0027It was quite extraordinary behaviour for a man of 49 with no previous convictions. \u0027Suspecting things only happened when you were there, your neighbours carried out some detective work and eventually a camera caught you doing what has been rightly described as quite outrageous behaviour. \u0027The most serious aspect of this case is the effect on Mrs Bulman. She must have been devastated to discover what had been happening. No doubt, the thought of you going through her underwear drawer has caused her considerable distress.\u0027 Andrew Turton, mitigating, said Gill was going through a troubled time in his marriage, and appeared to be getting depressed. He told the court: \u0027Custody would have a devastating effect not only on him but also his family. A lesson has been severely learned by this defendant in his fall from grace. \u0027There is clearly distorted thinking in terms of going through the act of entering the house and doing what he did. He has a good understanding about how his neighbour feels.\u0027 Gill, who sat through the entire hearing with his head bowed, was described by Mr Turton as a loving father and loving husband. The lawyer added: \u0027It is a disturbing case and an unusual case. It was not designed to cause distress because it was designed to carry out the nefarious activity in secret. \u0027He was acting out a fantasy in a situation that was secret. Obviously, he hoped never to be discovered. \u0027There was a level of estrangement from his wife, something of an attraction between him and his neighbour which he is candid enough to accept was a misinterpretation on his part in relation to the signals he was receiving. \u0027A perfect storm was created given he has in his background some fetish tendencies.\u0027 In a statement, Sharon told how Gill was becoming over-friendly towards her when she first noticed things out of place at her family\u0027s semi-detached home. She said the ordeal has left her feeling \u0027disgusted, filthy and disappointed\u0027 and said: \u0027I thought he was a friend and could be trusted, but he has proved me wrong. \u0027I no longer want to be in my bedroom and have trouble sleeping. I feel like throwing my underwear out in case anything else has happened.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Asylum seeker posed 15 year old schoolboy deemed ADULT","story":"Siavash, the refugee student removed from Stoke High School in Ipswich (pictured by another student on Snapchat) has been confirmed as an adult by the Home Office after they initially accepted he was 15          The man was suspended from school after classmates started questioning his age and also claimed they found  pictures of him on Facebook swigging a beer in Germany (pictured) with a full beardHis classmates also discovered what appeared to be old pictures of him on Facebook, showing him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.One boy even claimed he confessed to being a married father-of-two during a game of football in the playground.The man\u0027s brother was in Year 7 but the Home Office insists he is a child, but he has been moved to a new school.Who cares about Thanksgiving! Shoppers hit the stores to...\u0027The Government must take the gloves off\u0027: Manchester...MI5 and police\u0027s inquiry into themselves finds they made NO...Share this article     The Year 11 pupil who claimed to be aged 15 but looks far older with Facebook posts alleged to show him with a thick beard and sipping beers Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of the boy who was said to be his younger brother.          Caroline Wilson is the executive principal of Stoke High School – Ormiston Academy, which has 668 students It was also revealed that the pupil allegedly bombarded a 15-year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff - because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing \u0027sinister\u0027 about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at different ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged 25 and was married with two children when he was asked if he wanted to join in a game of football at break time.Some outraged parents withdrew their children from the school over the scandal, forcing senior staff to remove the asylum seeker from class.Mother and fathers claimed children were potentially being put in danger by the presence of a man posing as a boy.The Home Office has refused to reveal the newly assessed age of the man or any details of his background due to data protection issues. Officials who rubber-stamped his status as a child now face an investigation into how and why they came to that decision amid claims they just took him at \u0027face value\u0027. The school, whose principal is Caroline Wilson, also faces safeguarding questions.   The Home Office is currently investigating how the man\u0027s claim to be aged 15 came to be believed and he is believed to have been moved from the area.A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.\u0027Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.\u0027In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.\u0027 The spokesman confirmed that asylum seekers claiming to be aged under 18 are believed and treated as children by the Home Office unless they meet one of three criteria.They are only assessed as adults if there is \u0027clear and credible documentary evidence\u0027 that they are, an approved local authority assessment reaches the conclusion or if two immigration officers rule that their \u0027physical appearance or demeanour very strongly suggests they are significantly over 18 years of age\u0027.          The man\u0027s brother was also at Stoke High in Ipswich, but the Home Office say they are sure he is a child. He has been moved to another schoolIn the case of immigration officers making the ruling, at least one of them has to be of Chief Immigration Officer grade or above.The Home Office spokesperson added: \u0027When there is doubt about an inidual\u0027s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority\u0027s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be over 18, we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.\u0027In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.\u0027The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.\u0027The man started at Stoke High School which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust soon after the start of term in September. The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since. The younger pupil who claimed to be his brother was taken out of school at the same time.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were \u0027not attending the school\u0027 and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case. The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was \u0027posing as a pupil\u0027 in her class.He said: \u0027They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take.\u0027I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.\u0027The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies. \u0027The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.\u0027He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, \u0027You have not heard the last about this\u0027. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council denied that it was involved in the age assessment of the pupil and Suffolk Police said they do not believe there is any police investigation into the case. "},{"url":null,"title":"Raab says Mays Brexit deal WORSE staying EU","story":"Share this article \u0027But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that.\u0027 The last part of the Brexit deal - sketching out future trade terms after a mooted transition period ends in December 2020 - was dramatically signed off by negotiating teams yesterday.During furious Commons clashes, the Prime Minister hailed the outcome. \u0027This is a good deal for our country, for our partners in the EU,\u0027 she told MPs. \u0027It ends free movement once and for all.\u0027She said a new immigration system would give people access based on \u0027what they can contribute to the UK\u0027, there would be no more \u0027sending vast sums of money to the EU\u0027, and the jurisdiction of the European court will end.But Eurosceptics condemned the package as a \u0027costly surrender\u0027 and a \u0027betrayal of Brexit\u0027. Boris Johnson said the inclusion of an Irish border backstop that would lash the UK to EU rules \u0027makes a complete nonsense of Brexit\u0027.Former Cabinet ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, and DUP chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson also insisted the backstop must be scrapped altogether, warning: \u0027None of this is going to work.\u0027There was also anger that the issue of access to UK fishing waters appears to have been kicked back to be decided after March.Remainers accused her of putting the country on course for \u0027blind Brexit\u0027 with vague commitments.Some 88 Tory MPs have now publicly confirmed they will oppose the Brexit deal in a so-called \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 next month.Once the \u0027payroll\u0027 of ministers is taken into account, that is over half the party\u0027s numbers in the Commons.With the DUP, Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems also opposed, the prospects for the PM look bleak.Downing Street is pinning hopes for success on MPs looking at the alternatives of chaos of Brexit being cancelled altogether, and swinging behind Mrs May at the last moment. However, attention at Westminster has been turning to what happens if she lose the vote - with speculation Mrs May could try again in the New Year. Allies fear that unless the result is relatively tight she could be so badly damaged she will have to quit. Barring large numbers of MPs changing their minds, the government appears to be on track for humiliating loss by well over a hundred votes.

President Lenin Moreno is said to have terminated the credentials of his British ambassador, Carlos Abad Ortiz (pictured)          The decree, published by WikiLeaks, does not say why Ortiz, ambassador to the UK since 2015, has been recalled or who his successor will be          Assange has been holed up inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 when he was accused of sexual assault by two women in Sweden The envoy has been a key part of negotiations over the 47-year-old whistleblower,  who was behind a massive dump of classified US documents in 2010.The decree does not say why Ortiz, ambassador to the UK since 2015, has been recalled or who his successor will be, RT reports. In a tweet, WikiLeaks said \u0027all diplomats known\u0027 to Assange have now been \u0027terminated... transferred away from the embassy\u0027.Some have claimed online that the move increases the likelihood of Assange being handed over to British police. But isn\u0027t he in the Ecuadorian embassy? Police are mocked...‘I think it’s time for to apologise to Pamela Anderson’:...Share this articleIt comes after one of Assange\u0027s lawyers said the WikiLeaks founder will not willingly travel to the United States to face charges filed under seal against him.Assange, who has taken cover in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been granted asylum, has speculated publicly for years that the Justice Department had brought secret criminal charges against him for revealing highly sensitive government information on his website.That hypothesis appeared closer to reality after prosecutors, in an errant court filing in an unrelated case, inadvertently revealed the existence of sealed charges. The filing, discovered last week, said the charges and arrest warrant \u0027would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.\u0027    WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (pictured) has been charged in the United States, the organisation said last weekA person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity because the case had not been made public, confirmed that charges had been filed under seal. The exact charges Assange faces and when they might be unsealed remained uncertain Friday.Any charges against him could help illuminate whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election. They also would suggest that, after years of internal Justice Department wrangling, prosecutors have decided to take a more aggressive tack against WikiLeaks.A criminal case also holds the potential to expose the practices of a radical transparency activist who has been under U.S. government scrutiny for years and at the center of some of the most explosive disclosures of stolen information in the last decade.Those include thousands of diplomatic cables from Army Pvt. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, secret CIA hacking tools, and most recently and notoriously, Democratic emails that were published in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and that U.S. intelligence officials say had been hacked by Russia.Special counsel Robert Mueller, who has already charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking, has been investigating whether any Trump associates had advance knowledge of the stolen emails.Assange could be an important link for Mueller as he looks to establish exactly how WikiLeaks came to receive the emails, and why its dump of stolen communications from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta - beginning just after a damaging video of Trump from a decade earlier publicly surfaced - appeared timed to boost the Trump campaign.Assange, 47, has resided in the Ecuadorian Embassy under a grant of asylum for more than six years to avoid being extradited to Sweden, where he was accused of sex crimes, or to the United States, whose government he has repeatedly humbled with mass disclosures of classified information.The Australian was once a welcome guest at the embassy, which takes up part of the ground floor of a stucco-fronted apartment in London\u0027s posh Knightsbridge neighborhood. But his relationship with his hosts has soured over the years amid reports of espionage, erratic behavior and diplomatic unease.Barry Pollack, a Washington lawyer for Assange, said he expected Ecuador to \u0027comply with its obligations\u0027 to preserve asylum for him, though he acknowledged a concern that the county could revoke his asylum, expel him from the embassy and facilitate an extradition to the U.S.\u0027The burden should not shift to Mr. Assange to have to defend against criminal charges when what he has been accused of doing is what journalists do every day,\u0027 Pollack said. \u0027They publish truthful information because the public has a right to know and consider that information and understand what its government and institutions are doing.\u0027    Assange speaks on the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy after Swedish authorities announced that they dropped their investigation into rape allegations against himThe charges came to light in an unrelated court filing from a federal prosecutor in Virginia, who was attempting to keep sealed a separate case involving a man accused of coercing a minor for sex.The three-page filing contained two references to Assange, including one sentence that said \u0027due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged.\u0027It was not immediately clear why Assange\u0027s name was included in the document. Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the Justice Department\u0027s Eastern District of Virginia said, \u0027The court filing was made in error. That was not the intended name for this filing.\u0027The filing was discovered by Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, who posted it on Twitter hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department was preparing to prosecute Assange.The case at issue concerns a defendant named Seitu Sulayman Kokayi, a 29-year-old teacher who has since been indicted on charges of enticing a 15-year-old girl to commit sex acts and to produce child pornography. There doesn\u0027t appear to be any connection between Assange and Kokayi.The since-unsealed document, a motion filed in late August, mentions Assange in two boilerplate sections, suggesting a copy-and-paste error or that his name was inadvertently left in a template used for the common filings.The filing suggests prosecutors have reason to believe they will be able to arrest and extradite Assange.Ecuadorian officials say they have cut off his high-speed internet access and will restore it only if he agrees to stop interfering in the affairs of Ecuador\u0027s partners, such as the U.S. and Spain. He is allowed to use the embassy\u0027s WiFi, though it is unclear if he doing so. Officials have also imposed a series of other restrictions on Assange\u0027s activities and visitors, and ordered him to clean after his cat.Carlos Poveda, Assange\u0027s lawyer in Ecuador, said he suspects Ecuador has been maneuvering to kick Assange out of the embassy through the stricter new living requirements it recently imposed.He said possible U.S. charges, however, are proof his client remains under threat, and he called on Ecuador\u0027s government to uphold Assange\u0027s asylum protections. He said Ecuador would be responsible if anything happened to Assange.With shrinking options - an Ecuadorian lawsuit seeking to reverse the restrictions was recently turned down - WikiLeaks announced in September that former spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson, an Icelandic journalist who has long served as one of Assange\u0027s lieutenants, would take over as editor-in-chief.In a brief interview in Reykjavik, Iceland, Hrafnsson called the U.S. news \u0027a very black day for journalism.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Grandmothers fairytale family home converted water tower","story":"    The stunning 70ft high cottage in the Suffolk coastal village of Thorpeness is known as the \u0027House in the Clouds\u0027  The 1920s home, owned by Sylvia Le Comber, was originally designed to cover up a water tower on the Suffolk coast          The home, one of Britain\u0027s tallest cottages, has got its name from towering over every other building in the villageThe 78-year-old, who uses the \u0027fairy house\u0027 as her home, said: \u0027I have changed very little since I bought the house in 1976.

Others have named his countryman Robert Buie.A third Australian gunner, W.

Oh and I’m reading Frankenstein by Mary Shelley – for the first time!The book that changed my lifeLolita by Vladimir Nabokov. It forced me to learn the value of rereading. In looking for the dirty parts, I discovered how layered a work of literature can be.The book I wish I’d writtenJunior Miss by Sally Benson. Exquisite short stories about a girl growing up in New York, full of amazing details. The New Yorker published them in the 1930s. Writing about small, quotidian things in an interesting way is so much harder than writing about war and crime. The first story in this collection centres on buying a new winter coat and it’s riveting.The book that influenced my writingTwo seminal influences were essays, not books – Mary McCarthy’s The Fact in Fiction and Mary Gordon’s Good Boys and Dead Girls. One of the writers Gordon dissects in her essay is Theodore Dreiser, a huge influence on me. When I read An American Tragedy, Dreiser had so much empathy and insight that I felt as if he had peered into my soul. Finally, when I read the first line of Larry McMurtry’s All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers, it was so full of bright, shiny promise – on which it delivered – that I remember thinking, “Oh please let me make someone else feel the way I do right now.”The book that is most underrated A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith has never enjoyed the stature it deserves. Like Huckleberry Finn, it should be considered a classic. Unlike Huckleberry Finn, it concerns a girl’s life, in an impoverished section of Brooklyn in the early 20th century, so it isn’t seen as universal in its themes. It’s a raw, unvarnished book.The book that changed my mindIt’s a tie between Julia Sweeney’s Letting Go of God and Christopher Hitchens’s Hitch-22. For years, I had identified as agnostic or even deist, but those two very different books allowed me to come to terms with the fact that I am a very reluctant atheist. I hope I’m wrong, I yearn to be wrong.The book I couldn’t finishJust one? Impossible. And I hate to diss other writers. I will say there was a popular, beloved book and I hated it so much that I stopped reading on the penultimate page. Refusing to find out what happened to its horrible heroine felt like a principled protest at the time. Besides, I’m sure she got the happy ending she didn’t deserve.The book I’m ashamed not to have readUlysses by James Joyce. I’m going to keep trying, though.The book I give as a giftEmma Who Saved My Life by Wilton Barnhardt, one of the best books ever about being young, but also about New York City in the 1970s and 80s.

Agatha fans, come along and say hello! I\u0027m sure there will be mince pies! S xThanks to Sophie for joining us and thank you all for your great questions. Join us next Tuesday on the Reading group where we’ll announce our December theme!Without asking you to give away your secret recipe, how do you start crafting the plot to a Poirot? What comes first, a concept or a conflict that pops into your head? A murderer’s character? A brilliant twist? Where do you start?!? I always start with either a great opening mystery hook (as in Mystery of Three Quarters) or what I think is a great twistending (as in my first two Poirots). Then I work either backwards or forwards.In an earlier response you mentioned Christie’s intellectual curiosity and literary ambition. This is something I thought about when reading some of her books, and recalling others, in preparation for this month.How serious do you think Christie’s literary ambitions were? Have we knowledge of any manuscripts squirrelled away that were her stabs at “proper” literary fiction?I think the distinction between literary and popular fiction is a fairly arbitrary one, to be honest. Christie was very serious about wanting to extend the boundaries of the genre, and also of the kind of books she was expected to write. I think in an ideal world she would have wanted to try writing all kinds of different genres. She wrote several novels that weren\u0027t crime, under the name Mary Westmacott - they are literary novels, in a way.Hi I love your new Poirot books. Don’t you think it’s amazing that she chose a European refugee as her all knowing detective and that he makes fun of Hastings so much? Or perhaps what’s amazing is that dynamic gaining such popularity?Yes, it\u0027s amazing - and shows, I think, that she wasn\u0027t a snob or a little-Englander at all. She used Poirot\u0027s outsider status to demonstrate how the English middle and upper classes dismissed the accountexperience of anyone who wasn\u0027t exactly like them.If you could have another author take on writing one of your characters, who would you like to see take up the reins?Hmmm. That is a very interesting question. Someone new and up-and-coming whose name I don\u0027t know. Whoever could demonstrate to me that they could write about Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer AND write a self help book about how to hold a grudge!@FayFung3 on Twitter says:Is it possible that Hercule Poirot and Mrs. Marple would be friends? I think if they met they might well be friends, yes. But Agatha Christie didn\u0027t put them together in the same story, and so I don\u0027t think I should either.@kategof asks on Twitter:1 can we expect more Poirot novels? And2 what is your fave Christie novel? thank you! Yes, I\u0027m writing a fourth one for sure - and it will be published in 2020! My fave Christie novel is The Hollow, or Murder on the Orient Express - can\u0027t decide!@afcwheels asks on Twitter:Have you decided how you will end Hercule Poirot’s career? Agatha ended his career in Curtain in the 1970s! My job is to write a small middle section of his career!@Komorebi_Days asks on Twitter:I would like to ask if Sophie will be writing about Harley Quin (from The Mysterious Mr. Quin) also. It would be great to see more stories involving him. No plans to, no. Sorry! Poirot is keeping me busy enough!A question from Twitter - @smithpm81 asks:i want to know if Sophie pictures David Suchet in her mind when writing Poirot, i know i do when reading her books. (Also i cannot help picturing the actor who played Japp as her character Catchpool)When writing, I\u0027m kind of imagining Poirot from the insideas a character, and I tend not to \u0027see\u0027 him visually. I\u0027m thinking far more about what\u0027s in his mind and how he\u0027s behaving. I do however think David S is a perfect visual and aural representation of Poirot - I love him!What is it that makes you think Christie is a genius? (I guess I’m also asking: What sets her apart from other crime writers - and why has she remained so popular.)Several things, IMHO, make her an incomparable genius:1) ingenuity of her plots and how they expanded the ambitions and possibilities of the genre.2) amazing blend of opposites: her books are both v simple and v complex, v dark and v funenjoyable.3) her sheer and tangible love of storytelling above all else4) her unguessabilityunpredictability5) her wisdom and insight into human nature6) her prose - crisp, elegant, not a word too much or out of placeI’m afraid it’s a bit off topic: I love Sophie’s poetry, but she hasn’t published a collection in over 10 years. Has she given it up (can a poet ‘give up’?) or is it just dormant for now?Not quite dormant, Mark! My poetry muscles are currently busy writing lyrics for songs in musicals! Together with a good friend, Annette Armitage, I have written 2 musicals - one of them is a murder mystery musical and the other is a musical locked room mystery. One is on tour at the moment, and at the Cambridge Literary Festival this weekend! I still do write poetry and will be writing more in the near to medium future, too.Will you write a Poirot that has anything about his love life in it?I\u0027ve chosen not to. Agatha never went into detail about his love life, so I feel I should follow her example!Over the past twenty years there has been a huge upsurge in popularity for psychological thrillers. More recently, there has been a small but noticeable rise in popularity for crime novels inspired by the golden age of detective fiction. As you’ve written in both genres, which do you find most fun to write? Do you feel whisky-soaked detectives with a orce-riddled past have become a cliche? And what would your advice be to aspiring crime writers who want to break in to the “golden age” category - do they need to adopt some of the tropes of the thriller (like the wonderful Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle)? Or could a more comedicWodehousian edge be a worthwhile spin? Finally, what are your top three Christies? Mine are books that others might see as humdrum - The Moving Finger, The Sittaford Mystery and They Came to Baghdad.I don\u0027t have a favourite between the two - I love writing dark contemporary thrillers and I equally love writing my Poirot novels. Yes, anything becomes a cliche if it\u0027s done too often. I\u0027d say the secret to breaking through in any genre is to write something original, unexpected and unguessable. That\u0027s why 7 Deaths of EH did so well - totally fresh and surprising. Key thing is: great hook and great story - whether it\u0027s grimdark or upbeat-comic. People love gripping stories over and above everything else.My favourite 3 Christies? The Hollow, Murder on the Orient Express and Sleeping Murder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33d5df857d3fd3d1d804757fe0420d9728ac9c6a/0_134_4062_2437/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f324042e6db72c84a2caeb22e8f8656e","title":"has the backlash to black friday already started","story":"Brands, activists and charities are questioning the annual consumer feeding frenzyBlack Friday may be one of the biggest shopping days on the calendar, but it has also spawned a flurry of alternatives to the consumer frenzy from brands and charities.Greenpeace has teamed up with partners including Fashion Revolution and Shareable to back Make Smthing week, during which artists and crafters lead workshops on creative ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods.Events taking place over the weekend include ShareFest in Totnes, Festival of Sustainable Fashion in London’s Hackney and Leeds Community Clothes Exchange.The Charities Aid Foundation is backing the UK’s efforts for global charity event Giving Tuesday on 27 November, which encourages people to do something for – or give something to – a charity they care about.

There’s the terrible and accelerating effect of climate change, the rise of fascist and “alt-right” politics, violent conflict, millions of stateless refugees, a looming Brexit crisis and political turmoil in many other directions. But there have been many other awful moments in history – the Black Death the first world war famines in China, Russia, India and across the world the year of the Spanish influenza epidemic the period after the Nazi party came to power the blitz.While these may all be contenders for the worst year in history, there is one outright winner: 536. Studies have now confirmed it. And, let me tell you, as a denizen of that dark age – the researchers are correct. It was the worst of times. Here in Britain in 536, as we suddenly learned, things could always get worse. You could lose the sun.One minute we sixth-century folk had normal weather – then suddenly the sun stopped shining. It could be seen in the sky but the world received very little heat or warmth, as if our primary source of energy had been replaced by the moon. Britain – always cold – was now completely freezing. Some said it was a terrible cloud of ash, others an act of God because the people had been wicked. At first the problem was that we were always cold and then we didn’t have enough light to see by, but before long the crops failed and we began to starve.Over in the 21st century, scientists can be fairly sure that massive volcanic eruptions in late 535 and early 536 – possibly in Iceland – sent plumes of ash into the atmosphere, blanketing the sun and leading to a sudden drop in temperature. It has been suggested that another massive eruption in 540 not only lengthened the disaster, but also contributed to the decline of the Mayan civilisation.Devastating as the eruptions and subsequent blanketing of the world were, they weren’t the only problem facing us in 536. The Roman empire had crumbled and war had been raging across Europe. The Angles invaded Britain and said we had to obey them – and so we exchanged one set of masters for another. Tribes fought around Britain and old hatreds resurfaced. The possibility of war has always been heightened by a lack of resources – and, for the first time in centuries, the shortages were spread across the known world.As if that wasn’t bad enough, fairly soon the bubonic plague began to spread across the eastern Roman empire. Those few who remained of the native population of Britain were battle-weary, fighting over government, constantly diseased and starving. Life was terrible. And there still wasn’t any sun.We thought the world was ending. After all, what else could it be? Nobody could truly understand the cause of this sudden crisis. All the average Briton wanted was to get rid of the Roman occupation – and then when we lost them, we got more war. The years after 536 continued to be grim in Britain – the weather got colder due to more eruptions, we continued to struggle to find food, we got diseases, we fought again. There were more invasions.To quote Hobbes, plenty of our history has been nasty, brutish and short. But 536 stands out as a year that was devastating in itself, but that also had repercussions that affected people worldwide for years afterwards. The worst thing was that this climate change wasn’t made by humans. It was a freak natural event that threw ash across the sky. In 2018, humans know they have a direct role in creating global warming. But at that time we couldn’t blame ourselves – the volcanoes and the subsequent events weren’t our fault, and we couldn’t have done anything to stop them. Although we did think the gods were cursing us.If in 2018, if you’re feeling things are pretty hard, I have a somewhat hopeful message: they can get better – it just may take 200 years or so. By 640 life was improving and through to 700 the world was looking quite rosy – although the bubonic plague did keep coming back.It took almost two centuries for European civilisation to truly recover from the damage of the catastrophic eruptions in 536. There was an increase in industrial processes around the year 640, with ice cores and dendrology results suggesting that silver smelting, among other processes, increased – implying a growing need for coinage as well as general silver and marking a rise in prosperity. It took a while for the population of Britain and Europe to recover from the effects of starvation, plague and war – but it did recover. Perhaps there is some small comfort in that.In late 2018, you’re unlikely to wake up one day and find that the sun is gone – yet the world around you can seem extremely fragile and under threat. But never forget: 536 truly was the worst in history.• Kate Williams is professor of history at University of Reading.

We are also told that she fought hard to protect its interests from the rapacious French and Danes. We are told that she kicked the whole can of fish down the road until 2020. Which is correct? Answer: a bouillabaisse of all three.The draft Brexit deal to be put to EU leaders this weekend “betrays”, implicitly, the overblown promises made by some Conservatives and Ukip. It fights off demands by France, Denmark, Spain and others for guarantees of unchanged access to British waters post-Brexit. It leaves all details to be decided until July 2020 and conceivably not until 2022, marooning British fishers inside the EU policy for another two years and possibly another four years.The political declaration recognises Britain’s right to become an “independent coastal state”, ending the automatic rights of Irish and continental boats to fish within the UK 200-mile limit. The document goes on, however, to say: “Within the context of the overall economic partnership the parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quota shares.” Some Conservative MP and fisheries lobbyists insist that that is a sell-out. Fish will become a chip on the negotiating table as Britain’s future trade terms with the EU are hammered out over the next 18 months.Quite the opposite, says the government, backed by the biggest British fishing “union”, the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation. The clause makes it clear that fisheries will be dealt with separately from the rest of the “overall economic partnership”. There will be no trade-off of cod for car parts or herring for life insurance.This is dancing on the head of a haddock. Both arguments miss the point. As Michel Barnier’s deputy Sabine Weyand pointed out in a tweet yesterday, the issue is not fish quotas in return for an overall trade deal. It is continued quotas in return for continuing British fish trade with the continent.It is inconceivable that France, Denmark and the rest will allow Britain easy access to their fish markets if we destroy much of their fishing industries by barring their boats. In any case, tariff-free and easy exports for British fish and shellfish are more important to large parts of the British fisheries industry than the right to increased quotas.This is the issue ignored by the “take back our waters” promises of the Brexiteers. It is the issue now implicitly recognised in the words of the draft Brexit political declaration.If this is taken as a “betrayal” to parts of the fishing industry, it will come as a relief to many others.Other EU governments plan to make a separate declaration at Sunday’s summit that a future fish deal must “build on” existing access and quota rights. This will make life even more uncomfortable for May but will commit other member states,not Britain. It suggests the future fish talks will be stormy – but we knew that already.The bill on post-Brexit, which received its second reading in the House of Commons this week, talks of “auctioning” off repatriated quotas to the highest bidders. Despite Michael Gove’s talk of reviving “fragile” coastal economies, this implies that the sea-lion’s share of the new quotas would go to thriving, big interests, not to struggling small boats and small communities.There is a case for a post-Brexit reshuffle of the pattern of quotas laid down by the Common Fisheries Policy since the mid-1980s. Britain is unfairly penalised by some of the quotas, especially the small amount of cod allocated to English boats in the Channel.But many of the fish caught by continental boats belong to species we don’t eat much (saithe and whiting) or species unfit for human consumption, which go to fatten Danish pigs.There is scope for some reallocation post-Brexit, but not the offshore El Dorado that some fishermen’s leaders and Brexiteers claim. To “buy” continued easy access to EU markets, Britain will have to concede generous quotas to its neighbours (just as Norway already does).If the present Brexit deal survives the House of Commons, there will be no change in fisheries rules until December 2020 or, if the transition is extended, until December 2022. This will disappoint many fishermen but it offers a period in which all sides – government, big interests, small boats, fishers and traders – can throw propaganda overboard and begin to discuss the real long-term interests of the majority of UK fishers and coastal communities.• John Lichfield is a former EU correspondent based in France"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30b24faf36f4ee6da014cae9166ec8cd6809fda/0_146_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b3b1ebc030f0788ee16b05b52eaac50","title":"fiona bruce question time","story":"In an ideal world, discussions of the vacancy at the helm of Question Time wouldn’t need to be prefaced: “They have to get a woman this time.” But in the world we’re in, where these choice current affairs spots are distributed like mini-papacies, it’s a driving necessity, otherwise it’ll be more yik-yakking patriarchy until 2050.Yet it’s hard to get excited about generic womankind, and it wasn’t until the pointillist daubs of femaleness clarified into the face of Fiona Bruce that I was able to muster active enthusiasm. I can see her bringing the spirit of Antiques Roadshow to the format, welcoming the audience and their treasured opinions, in the family for generations, turning them over, inspecting them respectfully, inviting expert view, delivering the verdict: I’m sorry, this opinion is not a diamond. It’s paste, I’m afraid.While it’s in the business of upsetting its own apple cart, Question Time, and indeed the BBC generally, could use a few more changes. Its preference for the voices of the fringe right (Julia Hartley-Brewer, Jordan Peterson) over those of the likable, commonsense left is well documented. Caroline Lucas, for instance, has had a fraction of the appearances Nigel Farage has.These examples – a woman who commemorates acts of terrorism with childish and defamatory accusations that Corbyn applauded them, and a man who is the poster-philosopher for the “incel” movement, seeking to restore women to chastity with cod evolutionary biology and negging remarks about their hair – are just taken from the past three weeks. You don’t even need wifi any more for evidence of this nonsense.However, I do not share the view that it speaks of a rightwing bias within Question Time or the wider corporation. There are a number of contributory factors: first, a lack of genuine ersity among its staff, true since its inception but intensified by the 21st-century wheeze known as “internships” to ensure that only the wealthy can enter the mainstream media. This gives the BBC a constant fear of its own homogeneity. “We have to have Nigel Farage on, because none of us can speak to those people.” Meanwhile it recoils from the radical left, like sheep from an electric fence: what if it doesn’t respect their version of progress? What if it gives them a shock?Genuinely, the only answer to this is more ersity – of class and race, not just gender – across the piece, such as a responsible public service broadcaster would have already sought.More importantly, though, they are driven to invite on contrarians by the constant fear that the format is boring as the fear intensifies, the contrarians must be ever more extreme, and soon they’ll have Tommy Robinson on, while a bland BBC Twitter account insists that the vital work of situating child sexual exploitation in a totally bogus ethnic context must, of course, take precedence over any of those boring lefties with their mad cat-woman quest for actual things that are true.And here they are indeed in a fix: a panel of the apolitical golden years – Andy Burnham, Ed Vaizey, Nick Clegg, all agreeing that children must be lifted out of poverty and their feckless parents ought to take responsibility for themselves – was not interesting. The highest audience figures in recent memory were indeed when Nick Griffin appeared.You could argue that maintaining decency in the public sphere was more important than the audience figures for any format, tired or not. I, however, would be more emollient, and say there are better ways to liven these stiffs up a bit.They could borrow the siren system from QI, and have a series of buzzers set off by key phrases: dog-whistle racism met with an actual high-pitched whistle a foghorn for the phrase “If you’re asking me (insert question that nobody asked), then what I’d say is (prepared answer)” a bazooka for any statement on Europe that would be impossible meaningfully to enact. They could bring more of a sense of consequence by getting live-feed reactions from the nation fed back to the panellists, to see who cracked first and offered to nationalise the royal family.Let’s not give up on Question Time altogether: it may be like Doctor Who or James Bond, in need of nothing but a regeneration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1619cd0a482ff0db673ec715ddc2a53560eda65/0_158_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5db23a13f27b3735c9afcc937fc4997","title":"peoples vote brexit mps second referendum","story":"If MPs don’t back Theresa May’s deal in full, she’ll be forced to resign and Brexit will go to at least one people’s voteBritain’s convoluted negotiations over leaving Europe have left many in a state of confusion. But now things are becoming clearer. There is a deal with the EU, agreed by the cabinet despite howls from the Tory backbenches, while attempts to bring about a no-confidence vote in the prime minister appear to have fizzled out.But this still leaves many things unresolved.If Britain and the European Union sign the “deal” – that is, the withdrawal agreement and the declaration on the future relationship – it must then be ratified by the European parliament and by Westminster.MPs have been guaranteed a “meaningful vote”. They must approve the deal on a motion and then legislate to ratify the withdrawal agreement. The Lords only have to “take note” of the deal and ratify the agreement.The Commons vote, however, will not be as “meaningful” as it appears. In practice, MPs have only two choices: to ratify or refuse to ratify. Substantive amendments would not alter the agreement, and would be equivalent to rejection.Some MPs appear to believe that, if amendments are passed, the prime minister could return to Brussels to seek a better deal. That is implausible. The EU regards the deal as a package that cannot be untied. If Britain seeks to amend provisions that it dislikes, the EU could seek to untie the package in its own favour by amending provisions that it dislikes – Gibraltar and fishing rights being two discussed this week.Hence, if any amendments were to be carried against the government, the prime minister would have lost her authority. She could hardly return to Brussels to say: “Parliament will not back me – will you please give me something better?” The EU would reply: “We only deal with those enjoying democratic legitimacy.” The truth is, if the bill is not passed in an unamended form, the government will not be able to ratify the agreement.In 1993, when John Major was defeated on a provision ratifying the Maastricht treaty, he returned to the Commons the next day, declaring it a matter of confidence and threatening to dissolve parliament. The rebels, fearful of an election, duly came to heel.That procedure, however, is not open to May. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, passed in 2011, a substantive motion cannot have a confidence vote attached to it. Parliament can only be dissolved if a specific vote of no confidence is carried against the government, and if no alternative government can be formed within 14 days. It would be a bold Conservative or Democratic Unionist MP who would be prepared to oppose the government in a confidence vote.Alternatively, an early election could occur if two-thirds of MPs voted for it. Given what happened last year, it is highly unlikely, however, that many Conservatives would be prepared to take this risk. Turkeys do not normally vote for Christmas.If defeated on the approval vote or the legislation, May, therefore, would have little option but to resign. There would then be an election for a new Conservative leader. No one other than a Conservative would be able to command a majority in the Commons.If, as is likely, there is more than one candidate, the leadership will be settled by party members who would have to decide between the two candidates most favoured by MPs. The election would take at least a month, and probably longer. It might not be completed until just before the Brexit date of 29 March.Meanwhile, either May would continue as a caretaker prime minister or there would be an alternative caretaker – possibly her deputy, David Lidington, unless he were himself a candidate. Such an arrangement would be perilous for a country approaching Brexit when so many difficult decisions need to be made and the new prime minister would face exactly the same dilemmas as May – Brexiteer and remainer MPs opposed to the deal for incompatible reasons.Many Labour MPs, together with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats and a few Conservatives, favour a people’s vote. MPs might indeed pass an amendment that the deal only comes into effect following a referendum. But that would not be sufficient to provide for one. Since Britain lacks a generic referendum act, specific legislative provision would have to be made.The legislation providing for the 2016 referendum was introduced in May 2015 and enacted in December. No doubt the procedure could be speeded up but even so, the Electoral Commission believes there should be six months from introduction of the bill to the referendum, including a 10-week campaign period. There would therefore have to be an extension of the Brexit deadline beyond 29 March.There would be difficult issues for the Electoral Commission to resolve – in particular whether there should be just two alternatives or three. A simple referendum posing remain versus the deal would not satisfy many Brexiteers, who might favour a no-deal outcome. Therefore, there would have to be three options. MP Justine Greening has argued for a single referendum with a transferable vote. I would favour two referendums held a couple of weeks apart, the first asking voters whether they wished to leave or remain. If leave won, the second referendum would seek a verdict on the terms of departure. No doubt the Brexiteers would still say the cards were stacked against them since a single remain option was being opposed by two leave options.The other alternative to a deal is a no-deal Brexit. That, perhaps, need not be as terrible as some suggest. Bilateral agreements on specific sectors such as aviation could ensure that chaos is avoided. But there would be a host of customs, VAT checks and regulatory checks at Britain’s borders, involving hours of extra paperwork and delays, not to mention the issue of the Irish border. The queues at the Turkish border with Bulgaria, where a two-hour wait counts as a good day, would be replicated at Dover. That means higher costs and lower revenues. Business is almost unanimous in opposing a no-deal Brexit.MPs are taking out their frustrations on Brexit by giving May a battering. But perhaps she can console herself by remembering the wise words of Iain Macleod, colonial secretary in the early 1960s. “The Conservative party,” he said, “is a generous party. It always forgives those who are wrong. Sometimes it even forgives those who are right.”• Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at King’s College, London.

The cost of this benefit was shouldered by the Department for Work and Pensions, in turn moving a big chunk of BBC funding into the torrid world of political decision-making, away from its former position relatively insulated from arguments about government spending and cuts. This insulation was wise and deliberate: the founding fathers of the BBC in the 1920s – both within the corporation and the government – had foreseen the danger of arguments about the corporation’s financial arrangements becoming too closely embroiled in party politics. That, they foresaw, could imperil the BBC.In 2015 the potential for disaster was realised. Conservative chancellor George Osborne decided the cost of free licences to the over-75s ought to be borne by the BBC itself – meaning a huge cut to its funds. Mr Osborne wanted the national broadcaster to know it was not immune to austerity. It had to do less, with less money. The move freed up resources for the DWP while punishing the “liberal” BBC. When the then culture secretary, John Whittingdale, conveyed the news of this decision, Tony Hall, the BBC’s director general, told him it would be like dropping an atomic bomb on the corporation. The move would cost the BBC £750m by 2020. This equates, it is now calculated, to the combined annual budgets of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, and the children’s services CBBC and CBeebies.The BBC should be supported to examine carefully these options and come up with a sensible solution. It is right that vulnerable elderly people should be helped to enjoy the company of the BBC but it is also true that many elderly people are not badly off – and that in many cases the weight of generational inequality lies more heavily on the young than the old. Younger audiences are using the BBC less and less it is besieged by criticism from the right and, increasingly, from the left. But for all its imperfections, it remains a beacon of British creativity to the world, one of the few common spaces in UK culture where all can gather on equal terms, and for Britons is the most trusted source of news. Particularly in these fragmented and uncertain times, its role should neither be squandered nor diminished into meaninglessness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9893148a5523ec4361b3af1c9ffb99138db50f35/0_0_4256_2832/master/4256.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbbc7cc6aa9b8412f891bffea6b3cea3 480w","title":"boat neck bateau top velvet slash audrey hepburn","story":"It’s the perfect foil for a huge pair of earrings – reason enough to endear the look to meThis isn’t why I did it, honest, but an unexpected benefit of this column becoming more sustainable through wearing and talking about the clothes we already have, as well as pieces you can buy, is that I get to make out like I was on to all the new “lewks” before anyone else was.For example: the boat neck. You probably think it was Meghan Markle’s Givenchy wedding dress with its wide-slashed, high-rise neckline that rebooted this style, don’t you? Well, sorry, Meg, but I bought this navy velvet top two years ago, from Finery. (It was £45. Finery is such a bargain.) True, I may not have worn it in front of a television audience of 18 million but I did wear it to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the Vue at the Angel Islington, and to Byron afterwards. (Hey, it was 2016.)OK, maybe this isn’t about me. But the point is, it’s a classic. Audrey Hepburn wore a white lace belted Givenchy boat-neck dress to the 1954 Oscars, where she won best actress for Roman Holiday she wore a black version – also Givenchy, that one with the chic little bow at each shoulder – in Sabrina. Brigitte Bardot and Pablo Picasso both nailed lounging around the south of France looking mesmerisingly sultry and Gallic in the classic Breton variant, which has a similar wide-cut neck.In fact, what is surprising about this neckline is that it isn’t a go-to more often. It is easy to wear because it exposes enough skin to lend a little human warmth to your outfit but in a more straightforward, less loaded manner than a deep v-neck.It can look chic and gamine in a beatnik kind of way with slim, cropped trousers or jeans this season, it’s also a useful pairing with high-waisted trousers. I find high-waisted trousers a lot more difficult to wear in practice than you think they will be. I love the idea of wearing them with a crisp mannish shirt, but the reality is trickier. In my head I am Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story. Then I look in the mirror, and I’m one fake moustache shy of Dandy Dan in Bugsy Malone. With a clean, no-fuss neckline, elegance in a high-waisted, wide-legged trouser is more achievable.What’s more, a boat neck is the perfect foil for a huge pair of earrings. This alone is more than reason enough to endear the look to me. But should you need further persuasion, then surely a royal warrant seals the deal.• Jess wears top, Jess’ own.

The animation, the Hollywood version of Edwardian England, the playful verbosity of the songs and above all, the presentation of Mrs Banks as a larky suffragette are understood to have enraged the Australian author, as, surely would this: the co-option of Mary Poppins as a feminist.It is an irritating reflex to take beloved figures from childhood fiction and bend them to adult political ends, but it is particularly perverse in the case of Poppins, given her creator’s dislike of piety. The original Poppins is not quite the spit-spot version with whom most of us are familiar, but a far darker, more irregular creature, powered in places by what reads as sublimated rage and inclined to embrace something that sails close to atheism.None of which is to say that Travers was right to despise the Disney version. After many years of not watching or thinking about the movie, I have been forced to re-engage with it as my children work their way through the Disney back catalogue and in anticipation of Mary Poppins Returns, the Emily Blunt reboot, directed by Rob Marshall and due to open at Christmas. What strikes me is how devastating the original film was.Poppins is a cypher at the heart of the movie who exerts influence not, as Mr Banks specifies in his advert in the Times, by being a “nanny who can give commands”, but in accordance with the principle that one changes others by changing one’s behaviour around them – in the case of Poppins – through a combination of beady observation and strategic obliviousness. She is impatient, indignant, above all incredulous when presented with the weakness of others. (“Are you unwell?” she asks Mr Banks after doing some light magic at him and in what we would, these days, identify as gas lighting.)Which is not to say Poppins is anything but good. She is, however, clearly a woman acquainted with the limitations of others and while she is sent to the Banks household to comfort sad children, it is also her mission to critique the English: coldness as a vehicle for stability blind adherence to tradition and emotional detachment as modes mistaken for virtue, all of which, over the course of the movie, Poppins smartly dismantles.There might have been a question of warmth with the character, were Julie Andrews not such a nuanced performer and there is real pathos in her Poppins, not just in the sadness when she says goodbye to the children, but in the nearest the movie gets to a torch song – a top pick for karaoke! – Feed the Birds. This is fanciful, but when she sings about the Bird Woman I always think Poppins is recognising the ease with which she, or any woman, might slip down the ladder, if we do not adhere to various misogynistic standards. The mad woman on the steps of St Paul’s is all of us and do not make me quote Gilbert and Gubar to prove it.Still, the question of feminism in the movie is a tricky one, not least because the film explicitly mocks the limitations of this kind of labelling, setting up Mrs Banks as a suffragette who is militant outside Downing Street – “take heart for Mrs Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again!” – and submissive at home. (The true feminist statement of the film is, of course, the heroine’s retort to Mr Banks: “Let me make one thing quite clear I never explain anything.”)This is not quite true. For all her seeming invulnerability, Poppins exhibits regret at the end of the movie in a tender moment with her talking umbrella. She is a stoic who counters the stoicism of Mr Banks, an epitome of Englishness charged with the very American project of making those around her articulate their anxieties. (Notably David Tomlinson, who as Mr Banks delivers the heartbreaking monologue about his failures as a parent, a man “brought to rack an’ ruin in his prime.”) She does not have a love interest, which in the context of Hollywood heroines might be considered the most radical thing about her.What is it she teaches the children? Empathy mindfulness a sneaky determination to win (at the horse race). Tidiness. Not to gush. Not to worry, overly, about whether or not they are liked. Simultaneously to believe and not believe what they see. As in the books, she denies to the children that anything magical has happened, inculcating scepticism and something worthwhile about view point.In fact, scepticism is her greatest asset a stand against credulousness and therefore systems, social and political, which would have the children mindlessly repeat what came before simply because it is familiar. And then she buggers off, truly a shocking moment of childhood. I remember the first time I saw this and could not believe a film was allowed to behave this way, break one’s heart so insistently then pretend the reunification of the Banks family was, in fact, a happy ending. No child I know bought into this. Poppins’ departure presages death and even as eight-year-olds, at some level, we knew it.And so she will fly back into our lives this Christmas. The makers of the new film say it is their intention to reintroduce joy at a particularly grim moment in history, but with Poppins it was never a question of joy pure and simple. It was, instead, a question of joy against the backdrop of the film’s only certainty, that whatever happens, the wind will change. It is not much as reassurance goes, but it will have to do.Mary Poppins Returns is released on 19 December in the US and 21 December in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37442a229c1d2787bc56b0d06f50e8af385b034/0_0_6333_3800/master/6333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c54cab2d7f6d164fcf5720c88a6534","title":"manchester uniteds casey stoney first english manager to join common goal","story":"Manchester United head coach and former England captain Casey Stoney has become the first manager in England to join Juan Mata’s Common Goal project.She joins the likes of Giorgio Chiellini, Mats Hummels, Kasper Schmeichel, United goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain and Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann in signing up for Common Goal, the project launched in 2017 and spearheaded by Mata.“I’m really excited to be joining the Common Goal movement,” said Stoney. “Football is such a powerful force for good that can help champion many issues and I have seen these first hand.Stoney won 130 caps in a 17-year England career, played for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics and was awarded an MBE in 2015.

I remember having an argument with Jonny Howson about it one day – I just kept turning the tap off. I was like: ‘What are you doing? You don’t need it on!’”“I’ve been a vegan for four years, plant-based, so that awakens you socially to become a lot more conscious about things. I’ll be honest, that wasn’t for ethical reasons at first, it was purely health. I was struggling with ulcerative colitis and I did a lot of research into diet and what could help. But then when you become involved in that it raises your awareness of the ethical side. You actually look at it and think: ‘This makes sense.’”Martin speaks a lot of sense too and it is an enjoyable hour spent in his company at Walsall’s training ground, where he recently became player-coach after nine years at Norwich. With a cup of green tea in his hand and football largely off the agenda, the 32-year-old talks about everything from Donald Trump’s denial on climate change to his frustration that Iceland’s Christmas TV advert was pulled.The supermarket’s animated short film, made by Greenpeace, featured an orangutan and the destruction of its rainforest habitat at the hands of palm oil growers. “That’s a fact, that’s what happens,” Martin says. “So why is that banned? Because it’s too political to be an advert? Why can’t we show people what actually happens for them to put palm oil in their shampoo or their peanut butter?”Martin is a fascinating character. On top of his two roles at Walsall, he has a foundation in his home city of Brighton and regularly returns to work with the children there. He also part-owns Erpingham House, the largest vegan restaurant in the UK, and is enrolled on the League Managers Association’s diploma in football management course.With a busy family life on top, it is a wonder he has time for anything else, but looking after the environment is too important to ignore. “There’s stuff we can’t control – the Brexit madness – but there’s stuff that we can have an influence on and help future generations. I’ve got three young kids and I want it to look as good as possible for them by the time they hit my age.”Martin is doing his bit. As well as his plant-based diet, he owns an electric car, recycles everything he can and promotes sustainability and environmental awareness to the children who pass through his foundation, which started as a football academy but is now a registered charity with a wider remit.“I wanted to go into more areas: disability football, walking football for the over-55s, and we’re really promoting girls’ football too. The vision is that we have a community hub for our foundation that’s based on what we’re about as an organisation – giving more opportunities to kids from deprived areas and that it becomes sustainable, like Forest Green Rovers on a much smaller scale.”Lucas, his local MP, liked what she heard about the foundation and it was after a meeting between the two that Martin, who has long been interested in politics, joined the Green party. Whether he can persuade a few footballers to follow remains to be seen. “I’ve tried to educate lads a little bit over the years,” Martin says. “When an election comes up, the younger boys say: ‘So who are you voting for then, Russ?’ I try and talk them through it and they say: ‘Who are we gonna pay less tax with?’ And then it’s like: ‘Well, it’s not really about that.’ And they’re like: ‘It is!’”Martin breaks into laughter after that last comment, but there is a serious message to get across when it comes to football and the environment. “Clubs can do a lot more,” he says. “A lot of times it’s bottom of their priorities, which sometimes you understand because they need to win matches. But I think they need to be a bit more socially conscious. At most Premier League clubs, there would be 100-plus bottles being used a day. I’d like to know if they’re being recycled. And I can almost guarantee that most aren’t.”While it is refreshing listening to Martin speaking so passionately about important issues away from the game, it is tempting to wonder what teammates make of it all. “I’m probably deemed a bit of a weirdo in terms of football,” he says, smiling. “But, to be honest, I’m past the point of worrying what others think. It’s not like: ‘Is it going to harm my employment opportunities because of where I vote and what I stand for?’ If it did, I wouldn’t want to work for those people anyway.”Although football management, rather than politics, is where Martin sees his future, he has high hopes for the Greens, starting with their target to become the third-biggest party in England. “There’s probably no better time to try and achieve that with everything that’s going on in the world,” he says. “I think some people believe in the Green party’s values and their policies but don’t vote for them because they feel they might waste a vote because they’re not going to get into power. That’s fair enough. But I think that has to change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02e9a32d7580a607c70b615df76dc6d8ed49069/0_144_4112_2468/master/4112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4d1232de58c527680ea4dc77ad7e47f","title":"premier league team news tottenham chelsea manchester united city liverpool ngolo kante","story":"Chelsea have announced a new commercial partner.BBC Radio Manchester has reported that League Two side Macclesfield Town are holding talks with Sol Campbell about their vacant managerial position.

A fourth Mullingar Town player who took part in the attack, who had not been playing in the game because he was already serving a ban for a previous assault, has been banned from all football activity in the FAI’s jurisdiction for life. “The recent assault on CCFL match official Daniel Sweeney resulted in local, national and international headlines,” said the CCFL in a statement. “The vicious, unprecedented level of violence directed at Daniel was unprovoked, unwarranted and unjustifiable.”“The incidents that occurred at the end and in the aftermath of this football game are not representative of the magnificent work undertaken by the volunteers in the administration, playing and refereeing of association football in our league or across any of the great leagues under the jurisdiction of the FAI.”Premier League: Manchester United v Crystal Palace Paul Pogba is set to return to action in Manchester United’s Premier League home clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday. The midfielder has recovered from the injury that ruled him out of the 3-1 loss at Manchester City on November 11, and Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Marouane Fellaini are also all ready to be involved despite question marks over whether they would be fit. Luke Shaw serves a one-game suspension having picked up his fifth yellow card of the season in the contest at the Etihad Stadium.Unai Emery speaks ... The Arsenal manager has been talking about Rob Holding has stepped up to the plate this season and in doing so, has justified the club’s decision to keep him on this summer.The defender has started 11 of the last 13 games across all competitions and has developed into a key figure in Emery’s first six months in charge at the Emirates Stadium. The 23-year-old stayed put following Emery’s arrival, while fellow centre-back Calum Chambers joined Fulham on loan. Coupled with injuries to Laurent Koscielny and Konstantinos Mavropanos, Holding has seized his chance and appears to have impressed Emery along the way. “We decided for him to stay here and when he had chances, he played well and he helped us with big performances,” he said. “Every match is a test, another test for Rob to do that. He is improving, he is taking confidence and with confidence he is at his best.“In the pre-season we also had Mavropanos - but he is injured now - we had also Chambers and we decided to let him go on loan to Fulham and we decided that Rob Holding stayed here. But in the pre-season, every decision was looking at the matches with the players and finding the best performance in this moment.”Holding’s place may come under threat in the next few weeks as Mavropanos and Koscielny return from their respective injuries. Koscielny is stepping up his return from an Achilles injury he suffered in the Europa League semi-final defeat to Atletico Madrid in May. Emery has not ruled out slowly introducing the Frenchman back into action, starting with Monday’s Under-23 fixture against Derby.“The process with him is that in this International break, it is to finish training with us every day to start playing, little by little,” he said. First, our idea is to start with the Under-23s, but also, these two weeks training with us, I am looking at him. He is well, with good performance, good feeling and I think he, today, is close to also play with us.“But the first idea is, and maybe on Monday, he can play with the 23s. We are going to decide tomorrow the plan with him, but we are thinking for him to start to take minutes.”Premier League: Burnley v Newcastle Newcastle defender Paul Dummett has been ruled out of his side’s Premier League trip to Burnley on Monday night. Dummett suffered a calf injury during Wales’ Nations League match against Denmark in midweek, with tests yet to reveal the extent of his setback. Rafael Benitez will give late tests to captain Jamaal Lascelles (shoulder), Jonjo Shelvey and Yoshinori Muto (both calf).Premier League: Manchester United v Crystal Palace Crystal Palace will welcome Wilfried Zaha back to their squad for the trip to Manchester United. Zaha missed Palace’s last game with Tottenham before the international break due to a hamstring injury but has now recovered, as has James Tomkins (knee). Mamadou Sakho has shaken off a knock he picked up on international duty, but Christian Benteke, Connor Wickham, Joel Ward and Scott Dann are all out.Premier League: Everton v Cardiff Everton manager Marco Silva has confirmed midfielders Gylfi Sigurdsson and Andre Gomes are fit to face Cardiff on Saturday. Sigurdsson did not even travel to join up with Iceland over the international break because of an ankle problem while Gomes joined up with the Portugal squad but was sent home after it was decided he was not fit enough.“We had some worries during the week about Gylfi but he’s OK and that’s good,” said Silva. “Gylfi and Gomes are OK. They are available for selection this weekend.” Press AssociationNuno responds to Football Leaks claims Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo is “totally convinced” the club have no case to answer following the latest allegations made by Football Leaks.Football Leaks claims the relationship between Wolves and agent Jorge Mendes breaches Football Association rules. Published by German publication Der Spiegel, the allegations claim that owners Fosun International own a 15 per cent stake in Mendes’ Gestifute agency and bought it shortly before they purchased Wolves in 2016.This paved the way for a number of players - and Nuno - represented by Gestifute to join the Midlands club. “I am totally convinced, totally,” said Nuno, upon being asked if he was convinced nothing sinister is afoot. “There is no subject, no issue on that. Let’s wait and see but I am totally convinced. What is important is that I don’t care about that. I don’t focus on that and I don’t give any importance to it.”Premier League: Wolves v Huddersfield Town Huddersfield will be without defenders Mathias Jorgensen and Chris Lowe for Sunday’s Premier League game at Wolves. Centre-half Jorgensen sits out a one-game ban after reaching five yellow cards and left-back Lowe sustained a shoulder injury in the recent home draw against West Ham. Jon Gorenc Stankovic and Erik Durm could fill the respective gaps, while midfielder Danny Williams has recovered from a long-term knee injury.Glenn Hoddle update: A spokesman for the former England player and manager turned pundit, who went into cardiac arrest at the BT Sport studios in late October has released an update on the 61-year-old’s condition. “After being taken ill on Saturday 27th October, Glenn received specialist care at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London,” it reads. To aid his recovery from a cardiac arrest, Glenn underwent surgery. He responded well to treatment and is now at home recuperating from the procedure. The care that Glenn received from St Bartholomew’s Hospital was exemplary. His family would like to thank the hospital staff and the many people who have sent supportive messages.“Doctors have outlined that rest is paramount for Glenn now. With that in mind, his family ask politely that their privacy is respected and that Glenn is given time to recover fully.”Benjamin Mendy injury news: Benjamin Mendy could be out of action for up to 12 weeks, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has revealed. The City left-back underwent knee surgery last week. Bernardo Silva has also been ruled out of Saturday’s trip to West Ham with a knock. Mendy missed much of last season after suffering cruciate ligament damage in his right knee. This time the problem is with the meniscus in his left knee.Silva is out after picking up an injury while away on international duty with Portugal and may also miss next week’s Champions League game at Lyon. “He cannot play this weekend,” said Guardiola. “It’s not too big but I don’t know if, next Tuesday, he’s ready.”And across to Germany!  Football Features editor Marcus Christenson is a man of huge influence. Indeed, he’s so influential that when Borussia Dortmund have a big announcement to make, they sent him the pertinent information in an email and he promptly forwards it on to whoever happens to be curating this blog. Here’s the latest dispatch from the Bundesliga front line ...Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund and Spain international Paco Alcácer are set for a long-term future together.BVB, who signed the forward on loan from Barcelona during the summer, have decided to exercise an option included in the loan agreement and purchase Alcácer for a fixed transfer fee. This means there will be a contractual relationship between the player and the club, in accordance with the terms agreed in the summer, that runs until 30 June 2023. Paco Alcácer has scored nine goals in the space of 303 minutes – spread across eight matches – since joining BVB. He has been involved in a BVB goal every 44 minutes on average. “We’ve informed Barcelona today that we will exercise the purchase option. Paco is wholeheartedly committed to us, has integrated quickly and has become a core component of our squad,” said BVB sporting director Michael Zorc, who added: “He’s a real goalscorer who has great footballing ability and has already decided some important games for us. We’re looking forward to lots more goals and assists from Paco in the coming years.” Paco Alcácer added: “I’m very happy to be in Dortmund, at BVB and part of this wonderful team. Borussia Dortmund was and remains totally the right decision for me. I’ll give it everything to repay the trust placed in me with performances and goals!”Attention Hammers fans! Jacob Steinberg knows so much about West Ham that if you opened his head and peeped inside, you’d probably see Trevor Brooking, Julian Dicks and Alan Devonshire playing head-tennis while eating jellied eels to a Cockney Rejects soundtrack. Here’s his take on how Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini has got on since taking over at the club last summer. Chelsea news: Maurizio Sarri has welcomed the “important news” that N’Golo Kante has signed a new five-year contract at Chelsea and, with the club under threat of a transfer embargo as Fifa investigate the recruitment of minors from abroad, is now hopeful Eden Hazard follows suit.Kante, secured from Leicester back in the summer of 2016 and an ever present in the league under the Italian to date, has signed a deal through to 2023 worth around £290,000-a-week. Chelsea have been hoping to tie Hazard down to similar terms for some time, though no agreement has been reached with the Belgian, who indicated over the summer that he might be ready to leave after six years at Stamford Bridge, currently contracted until 2020.Asked about any news on talks with Hazard, who should feature against Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow, Sarri said: “I don’t know the evolution of the deal, for the new contract, but he’s very well. Fortunately, he played the last match with the national team on Sunday, so he came back here on Tuesday. For us, that’s very important. I don’t know the evolution of the new contract, but I think we can do (it). I hope so, I hope so.”Kante, a two-time Premier League winner and a key member of France’s successful World Cup campaign last summer, has suggested he has already improved as a player in his short time under Sarri’s stewardship this season. “N’Golo, for us, is not just an important player,” added Sarri. “He’s a ‘determining’ player for us. So I’m really happy with the new contract. Clearly very pleased for him. And it’s a very important news, I think.More Manchester United news: José Mourinho has a “huge 23-player” squad that includes Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku for Manchester United’s game at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday, writes our Reni hat-wearing man on the Manchester beat, Jamie Jackson.Pogba missed United’s 3-1 defeat at Manchester City before the international break because of a muscle injury and he and Martial then withdrew from the France squad.Mourinho said: “Martial stayed with us and he worked really hard. He plays tomorrow. Is he ready to play three in a row in the same week? I don’t know. But the most important match is the next.Although United are seven points from fourth place Mourinho still believes his team can bridge this gap by Christmas.“I know it’s a big gap but I also know until the end of December we have eight matches to play and we are speaking about 24 points,” he said. “I believe we are going to be there.”Manchester United news: Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has refused to “play the game” and expand on comments made in a recent interview where he appeared to suggest some of his players lacked character.As we mentioned earlier (in the entry posted at 11.43am), Mourinho was quoted as saying in an interview with Hristo Stoichkov on Univision that some of his players “are children with potential, but without character”, with those he was referring to being Luke Shaw, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford. When asked about his remarks at a press conference on Friday, Mourinho said: “I don’t play your game. I don’t play the game of take out of context and do what you want. I don’t play the game. I have nothing to say.”In fairness to Jose, it would seem rather disingenuous to interpret his comments as an attack on his young players, when he was clearly come over all Abe Simpson and was suggesting youngsters in general have it too easy these days and are therefore lacking a certain amount of fortitude and inner steel.And back to Scotland ... Rangers manager Steven Gerrard admits the explanation they received for the recent dismissal of Daniel Candeias only added to their frustration. Candeias returns from suspension for Saturday’s visit of Livingston after sitting out one game following his red card at St Mirren.Rangers failed to overturn the winger’s dismissal after claiming mistaken identity when he was shown a second yellow card by referee Willie Collum after footage showed he did nothing wrong during a clash with Anton Ferdinand.The club later announced they would make a formal complaint against Collum but it emerged that the booking was for the Portuguese player’s goal celebrations, which were directed towards Ferdinand. When asked if that added to their frustration, Gerrard said: “Yes, slightly, because I don’t think you deserve to get a yellow card in football if you blow a kiss. But we accept it, we move on, no hard feelings, and we move forward.” Press AssociationMeanwhile in Ireland: St Patrick’s Athletic Football Club have issued a weird statement throwing their support behind Stephen Kenny, who manages their rivals Dundalk. “The board of St Patrick’s Athletic FC, as stakeholders in Irish domestic football, have convened and endorse and recommend Stephen Kenny for the vacant position as manager of the national team,” it begins.“We believe Stephen Kenny is the best candidate and that he has proven he has the experience, commitment and intellect to change the current direction of the Irish senior team. Stephen’s appointment would undeniably be a boost for both the grassroots and domestic leagues. All involved would know that the country’s game owuld be in the hands of a man who knows and believes that the future of the game is the nurturing and proper professional development of the game in schools, communities, academies and clubs countrywide. We hope that all stakeholders of the domestic game that agree, express their view in the public forum.”While the statement from St Pats seems well meaning enough, it’s difficult to know why exactly they’ve chosen to stick their oar in on this matter. One thing’s for certain, the appointment of Stephen Kenny to the Ireland job would certainly benefit St Pats, as well as all the other League of Ireland sides who finished trailing in the wake of Kenny’s champions last season.Neil Lennon speaks: The Hibernian manager says he is “flattered” to be linked with the vacant Republic of Ireland manager’s job, which comes as something of a surprise to this Irish reporter, who has not seen him being linked with it at all.Then again, it seems he hasn’t either. “I am in a very good job here and I am just concentrating on that at the minute,” said Lenny. “It is just speculation. I am flattered if there is a link, I have not seen anything or heard anything regarding myself, all I have been doing is concentrating on us getting back into winning form because that is important. I am sorry to see Martin go because he had such a huge influence on my career, 10 years I played under him.”Barry is now back from his lunch, refreshed, revitalised, rested, ready to attack the rest of the afternoon.

My belief in Slav and our ability to restart our campaign was staunch. Reports of Slav’s future being in peril, at the time, were truly baseless.I was troubled, subsequently, by our poor response and performances in the matches that followed. It became evident to me after our defeat at Huddersfield Town that patience and confidence were no longer a remedy to correct our course.Upon determining that a change was in order, I judged potential candidates against a demanding list of standards with two key criteria considered as absolute - past success in the Premier League or top-flight football and being ready to go to work immediately.I conducted the appropriate due diligence as to potential successors, and among many highly qualified candidates - some of whom were interviewed, others not - there was one man who clearly had done his research on our squad, wanted the challenge and was ready to go the instant his name was called. That’s Claudio Ranieri.Interesting smidge of team news ahead of Liverpool’s trip to Watford on Saturday: Daniel Sturridge - under an FA charge for misconduct relating to betting - is in contention to play some part. Jurgen Klopp said:Obviously I know about the case, but you don’t see any influence on Daniel in training. He’s completely normal, looks sharp, looks focused. Of course it’s not something you want but as long as he trains well he is 100 per cent in contention.Big ol’ game in Buenos Aires this weekend. Biiiiiiiiiiiiig ol’ game. Here’s former local Jonathan Wilson to tell you all you need to know.Hello. Barry’s off for some lunch, so it’s Nick Miller here for a bit. Emails to Nick.Miller@the, tweets to @NickMiller79. Premier League: Watford v Liverpool Javi Gracia knows just how much damage Liverpool can do when at full throttle - but he will set up his side out to tackle them head on at Vicarage Road.“We will be loyal to our style and play the way we usually do, but knowing we have to be careful with their players because they are very, very good,” the Watford manager said. “We know we are playing against this team and you need to play at a high level doing your best. It will be very, very demanding and if you make a mistake, they punish you. We will have our possibilities, but we want to enjoy playing the game and we try to get a good result.”Watford return to Premier League action in seventh place, having produced some positive performances since ending a four-match losing streak in mid-October. Midfielder Etienne Capoue will be available to boost Gracia’s options, while defender Sebastian Prodl has shrugged off his leg problem. Although Adalberto Penaranda has now received his work permit, the Venezuela forward is not expected to be thrown straight into action. Press AssociationJurgen Klopp speaks: At his press conference ahead of Liverpool’s trip to Watford this weekend, the Liverpool manager was asked about the new contract Sadio Mane inked yesterday. “It’s a big sign,” he told reporters. “To extend a contract is more than a signing, it is a statement. It shows a bit of change the club did in the last few years. A few years ago players felt they had to leave the club to make the next step.”Motherwell goalkeeper Trevor Carson is out for an indefinite period after developing deep vein thrombosis. Carson has been in and out of Wishaw Hospital with a blood clot in his shoulder following his return from international duty with Northern Ireland.“With my limited knowledge, he has had a blood clot and it is going to keep him out for a long time, said Motherwell boss Stephen Robinson. “He has been in and out of hospital since Wednesday. He felt a lot of pain while away with the international squad, came back and we thought it best that we take him into hospital.“The medical staff at Wishaw General and our medical staff have been superb with him. There are still ongoing investigations, so that we can get to the bottom of the problem and make sure he is on the right tablets and medication that gets him back as quick as we can, but he is out for the foreseeable future. “There has been no timescale put on that but first and foremost our concerns are with Trevor’s health. I am sure he will be fine but it is now important that we get the right treatment.”The football manager is proving a popular recruit on the reality show I’m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! and last night regaled his campmates in the Australian jungle with a tale about Sir Alex Ferguson. “Every manager after every game came in your office,” he said. “Fergie was always great. He had a great bottle of wine. He would get something special in when you went there. I have been in his office at 2:45 for a 3pm kick-off. The teams would go out and he would have the racing on! I would sit there and he said I have got one in the 2:45. I said ‘Alex I have got to go’. But he wasn’t bothered because he would go and win and had such a good team.” Premier League: Bournemouth v Arsenal Bournemouth striker Joshua King could return to contention for Sunday’s home game against Arsenal. King has missed the Cherries’ last four Premier League games due to an ankle injury and will be assessed by manager Eddie Howe. Full-back Adam Smith is definitely out and faces a long spell on the sidelines after sustaining a knee injury in the defeat at Newcastle before the international break.The Manchester United manager sat down for an interview with former Bulgarian international Hristo Stoichkov, conducted in Spanish, for TV network Univision Deportes at the end of October and initial reports said Mourinho told Stoichkov that Luke Shaw, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard of “lacked character”.However, it seems his quotes may have been lost in translation, as the Manchester Evening News got a fluent Spanish speaker to interpret the exchange in question. It seems Jose meant that because the youth of today have it so easy, some of them might be lacking a little in aggression.  Stoichcov: “In your team there are lots of diamonds. What are they missing?”“In English they call it ‘spoilt’, ‘spoilt kids’. Our kids are more spoilt than we were by our parents. We are more mature, we are better prepared. For young people now, it’s a different life on a social level compared to ours.“Character, personality, as they say in Spain as well, bad blood, that natural aggression that you had.”The head coach of the Manchester United women’s team, Casey Stoney, has become the first manager in England to join Juan Mata’s Common Goal project. Read on ...Premier League: Fulham v Southampton New Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri has two injury doubts ahead of his first game in charge at home to fellow Premier League strugglers Southampton. Kevin McDonald (hamstring) remains sidelined with Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa also ruled out by Ranieri with an unspecified issue, although Joe Bryan should be fit enough to return to the squad following his own hamstring problem.Mark Hughes plans to silence the “noise” around his future as Southampton provide Claudio Ranieri’s first opposition as Fulham manager. Hughes finds himself the favourite to be the next Premier League boss sacked after bottom-placed Fulham changed managers during the international break by replacing Slavisa Jokanovic with Ranieri.Southampton are only outside the relegation zone on goal difference and have gone eight games without a league win. But Saints boss Hughes shrugged off talk of his future before the crunch trip to Craven Cottage by saying: “There will always be speculation and I call it noise.” Hughes went on to say it was only natural that people might speculate about his prospects of holding on to his job. “Once a manager departs after a lot of noise that noise switches to someone else and all the negative stats come out. A little bit of the noise is around me at the moment which is the nature of the role that I have. It will go away with a few good results. It becomes a little bit predictable and you understand how it works.” Hughes succeeded Mauricio Pellegrino in March with Southampton in the middle of a relegation dogfight. The Welshman kept Saints up and signed a three-year contract in May, but he has won only three of his 20 league games at St Mary’s and defeat at Craven Cottage could drop Southampton into the bottom three. Press AssocationMick McCarthy is expected to chat with Football Association of Ireland officials in the next day or two, according to reports emanating from the Emerald Isle. The FAI are keen to appoint a replacement for Martin O’Neill before the draw for the group stages of Euro 2020, which will take place in Dublin on Sunday week. McCarthy is believed to be the frontrunner for the job he held previously, but Stephen Kenny is also in contention. The manager of League of Ireland side Dundalk, Kenny emphatically threw his hat in the ring while chatting to the Dundalk Democrat yesterday. “I don’t have a PR strategy,” he said. “I don’t have a dream team. I think managing your country is the ultimate honour. If you offered me the job of managing Real Madrid or Barcelona or Ireland, I would choose to manage Ireland, because it’s the greatest honour you can have as an Irishman.” Kenny has also rubbished suggestion that he might not be experienced enough to take the job. “I actually find the question quite insulting,” he told The . “You have to earn respect. You earn it on the training ground every day with your level of preparation and attention to detail no matter who you are you have to earn it every day. I’ve been with the Dundalk team for six seasons but every day I feel I have to go in and earn the respect of those players again. The minute you drop your standards, you receive nothing. Nothing.Premier League: Brighton v Leicester Brighton expect to have midfielder Pascal Gross and defender Davy Propper available again following ankle problems for the Premier League match against Leicester.

Since I came, I completely improved as a player, challenged myself and got some awards I never thought about.”Since joining Leicester City from Caen for just £5.6m in 2015, the midfielder has won Premier League titles with Leicester and Chelsea, and the 2018 World Cup with France.Kanté was also voted the PFA player of the year in 2017, and was included in the FifPro World XI this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d420d7210ac829aeeddf1911c38b5375673580/50_0_6993_4196/master/6993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e89536f7e0619a75e0eedfdb2764982","title":"ramla ali in boxing we are all equal ","story":"After her family fled Somalia and settled in Britain, Ramla Ali secretly took up boxing, having been teased at school for being overweight. Now she’s a national champion, and inspiring other African and Muslim women to fightWhen Ramla Ali, a British champion boxer, is preparing for an important tournament, she visits the Peacock gym in Canning Town, east London, where Lennox Lewis once trained. There she rattles through a revolving cast of handy sparring partners. Some are women – trusted contacts – but most are men, including today’s foil, Joké Amechi, an amateur boxer who is considerably more powerful than she is. Recently the pair have become good friends. Amechi hits hard, which Ali expects, but he doesn’t turn childishly sour or surly if she begins to outbox him, unlike other men. “One guy broke my nose,” Ali says. “I dented his pride. I couldn’t do anything for, like, six to eight weeks.”In 2016, Ali won the Elite National Championships, the English Title Series and the Great British Elite Championships, three major amateur tournaments, making her, at least for a short time, the best amateur boxer in the country in her weight ision (54kg then 57kg now). She has won titles around the world, boxed for England at a European Championship and recently became a Nike athlete (associates include Serena Williams, Simone Biles and Mo Farah). This month she’s competing at the Women’s World Boxing Championships, the pinnacle of amateur boxing, which are being held in New Delhi, India, and where Ali is expected to leave a mark. She’s travelling with an entourage of sorts: her coach, her husband and a film producer, who are all the same person.Today’s session is important for prep. “She won’t face a girl who can hit harder than Joké,” says the entourage, Richard Moore, whom Ali married in 2016. He’s standing beside the ring in full gym kit, watching Ali and Amechi take turns popping off combinations.Ali is tall and slim, and she boxes like she talks: in a speedy south London whirr. Because her limbs are long and lean, she can look gangly, but in the ring she glides. When Amechi jolts forward in attack, Ali dips sideways or swoops forward, avoiding the blow, and sets herself for the next defence, flashing a grin so large you can clock it from 10ft away – a you-can’t-catch-me beam. (“I just love it,” Ali says later, of boxing, but also evasion.) Amechi, a talented amateur, is here as insurance, to overprepare Ali for tough opposition. But as the session ends, it is Amechi who clutches the water bottle between his gloves. In 2014 one of Ali’s brothers, Taha, turned on the television and saw Ali competing live. It was the first time he’d seen his sister box, and he was shocked. “Nobody realised she was leading this double life,” another of Ali’s brothers, Imran, told me. When Taha notified their mother, who is devoutly Muslim, she became furious. She assembled the family.“It was an intervention,” Ali says. Her mother considered it immodest for women to play sports, and asked Ali to stop boxing immediately. Ali relented. “I’d hidden it for so long,” she says. “And then I stopped, for a really long time.”Ali was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, some time in the early 1990s. (She doesn’t know exactly how old she is.) Ali’s father owned a shop and her mother, who had seven children, travelled the country as a buyer.When Somalia descended into civil war in the 1980s, travel became perilous. Not long after Ali was born, the family’s garden was hit by a stray grenade, and her eldest brother, out playing, was struck by the blast. “My dad and my uncle put him in a wheelbarrow and began searching for a hospital,” Ali says. But their journey was made impossible by damaged roads, and whenever they reached a hospital they found it burnt out and abandoned. “They were searching, searching, searching,” Ali says. “But it was too far.”Her brother died. In mourning, Ali’s parents fled the country. (Her mother has since said: “I couldn’t lose another child.”) They packed money and clothes and abandoned everything else: the family home, her father’s shop, family records. They fled to Kenya by boat, a perilous journey: “It was supposed to hold, like, 200 people, and 500 get on. People died along the way.” For a while the family lived in Nairobi. A few years later they arrived in London. It was November and the British winter had already set in. Ali thought: “What is this? Where’s the sun?”When Ali was about 12 she began to be picked on by classmates, not because she was a refugee, but because she had suddenly put on weight. “One summer, boom, fat…” she says. “I went to an all-girls school, full of Asian and Indian girls, who are all genetically petite, and I’m there standing out like a sore thumb.”She pulls out her phone to show me a picture. A chubby girl looks back. “Nobody believes me when I tell them,” she says. “I was massive!”Ali’s mother suggested she join a gym. “I remember my mum kept telling me: ‘You’ve got to start thinking about your health, no one’s going to want you.’” Ali visited a leisure centre in East Ham, where she was thrilled by a boxercise class. “I thought, ‘This is amazing!’” Soon she joined a local boxing gym, and discovered a kind of home from home. “More than anything I liked that in the boxing gym, everyone is equal,” she says. “It’s like a respect. I mean, you don’t realise that at first. I was 13, you don’t realise things when you’re 13. But I was making friends.”Ali came to relish the rigour of a training routine. The weight “just started melting off”. “I never thought about competing,” she says. “It was for fun, fitness, confidence, making friends.” But a coach noticed her form and cajoled her into a ring. “That was it,” she says. “I had my first fight when I was 18.”Ali doesn’t wear a headscarf, but her faith is crucial to her identity, and when she began boxing she was conflicted about whether to continue. “She knew our parents would be so against it,” Imran told me. “My mum never saw it as a career,” Ali says. “We’d fled a war. We’d come here to have a better life, to get educated.”Imran is now a doctor. Ali’s other siblings include a nurse, an engineer and a sports nutritionist. Ali studied law, but discounted a legal career soon after graduating. She was becoming a very good boxer. “I didn’t want to get to 50 years old and think: ‘I could have done it,’” she says. When Ali’s mother demanded that she stop altogether, she lasted six months. “Then the itch came back.”Ali describes boxing like this: “You’re whisked into a completely different world. The only person’s voice I hear is his” – she’s referring to Moore – “and that’s it. It’s bizarre. You can hear cheering. But it’s like tunnel vision. All I can see is the person in front of me.” She continues: “It’s like a bubble, where everyone is equal, but no one else matters.”Moore believes that Ali considers the sport an escape. “Her greatest attribute is her ability to think in the ring,” he says. “She can think under immense amounts of stress and pressure – and still succeed. That probably comes from her background, seeing so much trauma, and being able to manage a situation under mental pressure.”When the couple married in 2016, they’d known each other for just four months. They met in a London gym. Ali was training. Moore, who for the summer had returned from Los Angeles, where he was producing a documentary, was working out. “I was blown away,” he says. “I remember being transfixed by her. I also remember thinking: ‘Why is this girl so angry?’”The first time Moore met Ali’s parents, at a family gathering during Eid, he told them the pair hoped to get married. “At first I just fed into their stereotypes of the crazy, irrational, impulsive white guy,” he says. “They didn’t think much of it.” But the pair were persistent, and slowly the family came around. “We had a religious ceremony at the house,” Ali says. “The imam came and blessed the marriage… And then I was tricked into having a huge party by my mum.”Before the wedding, Ali had begun to consider a life without boxing. She had left her coach, and the weight of keeping her passion secret from her family had become difficult to bear. But Moore sensed Ali wanted to continue and convinced her to maintain a training regime. Before long, he began to watch fights and training videos on YouTube, offering Ali advice based on the footage. Within a few weeks he became Ali’s coach. The month after they were married, Ali won both the English title belt and the GB Elite Championships. She hasn’t thought of giving up since.Last year Ali made the decision to represent Somalia at international level. Despite her credentials, she had been passed over by the British team. (Raven Chapman, a friend of Ali’s, who is training with the GB squad, told me: “It’s an age thing. I’m 24, and I’m on the cusp.”) Representing Somalia will offer Ali the opportunity to reach the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, a personal ambition. Ali identifies as both British and Somali. “My mum always told me: ‘Be proud of your heritage,’” she says. Although she acknowledges she is from two worlds, she says of Britain: “This is the only home I’ve ever known.”At the World Championships Ali will be the first person to represent Somalia at a major boxing event, and one of very few Muslim women ever to enter an elite ring. When she first approached Somali Olympic officials in 2017, the country didn’t have a boxing federation. So Ali and Moore created one, from London, an impressive act of political wheeling and dealing. Somalia has very few sporting federations. The country sent just two athletes to the Rio Olympics in 2016. Should she reach Tokyo, Ali will buck a major trend. “Most Somali athletes represent other countries,” Moore says, referring to Mo Farah, one of Britain’s greatest athletes, born in Somaliland, and to Bashir Abdi, a Somali-Belgian distance runner, born in Mogadishu. When Ali decided to pursue Somali representation, Moore asked her why. “She said: ‘It’s about showing other Somali girls, other girls in Africa, that it’s all possible, if you set your mind to it,’” Moore says. “It’s less about her. It’s about trying to lead the way.” Ali says, simply: “There’s a bigger picture here.”Every Tuesday, Ali travels to Vauxhall, in south London, to teach a group of Muslim women. “Self-defence,” says Ali. “Things like that.” The women are between 20 and 40 years old. “Things like that. They don’t usually have a space to train. Especially the stricter ones, who won’t take their scarfs off in a normal gym environment. They’ve just started sparring. They’ve been pestering me for weeks: ‘Can we spar? Can we spar?’ And I said: ‘No, you’re not ready.’ But two weeks ago they got started, and wow!”Ali considers these lessons representative of her mission: to show young Muslim women a way. Last year her mother began watching her fights. An uncle had become supportive of Ali’s goal, and convinced her mother to do the same. The shame vanished the family has become understanding. “Our mother feels like Ramla is doing something for Somalia,” Imran told me. “She’s giving back. She’s creating a platform.” For Ali, the World Championships offer a significant stage. To inspire young Somali athletes, “I don’t even need a medal,” she says. “I just have to show up.” Until then, training continues. So do the lessons. Ali will have the girls spar again next week. “We’ll black out the windows and lock the doors,” she says. “And they’ll just let their hair down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e149e5c82709b8d908c5e58f469000ac91c49e6/0_77_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ba874802ed4c7ff4b5abb703379941","title":"being ignored asked for advice","story":"As far as family life went, I was a younger one, and I was on mute. But at some point my mic must have been turned onRecently, I received an angry voice message from my Auntie B. “What do you think you are doing, telling your little cousin to disobey me?”Nobody does melodrama quite like my auntie. She’s committed. She’s the kind of person who would search “sad violins” on YouTube to ensure her tirade had a soundtrack. She probably rehearsed her speech in the mirror. It contained all the standard Asian drama touchpoints – rant, mumble, “disrespect”, rant, mumble, “shame on the family” – before the inevitable brass-section finale: “You’ll regret this when I’m dead!” A masterpiece, really.I’ve been thinking about this message a lot. I’m not concerned that I upset my aunt by helping my younger (but fully grown) cousin get a tattoo, but rather by what came next: “I just worry,” she said calmly, having exhausted herself. “Is she doing it because she’s angry? She won’t speak to me. How do I get through?”In my community especially, there are firm rules about how the family is organised. The young ones are to be seen and not heard, and the elders respected at all costs. And though I sometimes kicked against it, arguing that respect doesn’t always mean blind obedience, it didn’t make any difference. As far as family life was concerned, I was a younger one, and I was on mute.But at some point my mic must have been turned on. It caught me unawares.

I do not. They often ask why not, but I cannot tell them. The real reason is because I am a failure, both personally and professionally, and have been for most of my life. There are many causes – a mental health condition that it would be immoral to pass on, a date rape, an abusive relationship, a promising career destroyed by both the economy and my own poor decisions. I have discussed some of these issues with the couple of women I have known for many years. Hopefully you will understand why I do not wish to discuss them with those of short acquaintances, but I do want to make friends with them (I lack a regular, nearby support network). How do I tell them to get their noses out of my private business while still saying, hey, let’s be friends?You need to be kinder to yourself. You are not a failure. Living with a mental health condition and surviving a date rape and an abusive relationship does not make you a failure – how could it? I can’t comment on whether you have made wrong decisions in your career, but if you have, that wouldn’t make you unusual. Some great conclusions have been reached on a path of bad choices. So the reason for you not having children, I would argue, is because you are a survivor, not a failure. You chose not to have them. That is commendable. Every day I receive letters highlighting the damage wrought on children by people who went into parenthood without such cogent thought.Women who haven’t had children elicit curiosity in a way that men who made the same decision don’t. It makes people uncomfortable. I recently told an old friend – a mother of four – that a family member hadn’t had children. “I bet she regrets it, but can’t admit it,” the friend said. I bristled – she couldn’t grasp that my relative really didn’t regret it.But let’s look less at the subject matter and more at how to answer a question you don’t really want to answer. People tend to ask questions either to make small talk (and don’t really care what the answer is), because they are genuinely interested, or to validate their own decisions. Either way, it’s important that you stay in control of the answer you should not be swayed by the effect that it has on the other person – that’s their responsibility. Your responsibility is how you choose to answer it. The more words you use to explain a decision you’ve made, the more you give the other person to pick apart. Thus – in the circumstances you describe – it’s perfectly acceptable to answer very succinctly, then bat it back to them to let them deal with it.This is hard because, depending on your personality, the question asked and what nerves it hits, we often feel the need to over-explain ourselves, even to perfect strangers. You might want to think about what stops you just smiling and saying, “No”, in reply to, “Do you have children?” I mean, that’s factual, isn’t it? Do you fear their discomfort at such a short answer, or more questions? If they ask, “Why not?” you could then say, “I chose not to, now what about you? Do you have children?” After all, given half a chance, most people love talking about themselves. Let them validate their own decisions.Don’t let the subject of you not having children dominate the conversation, and you should find that the other person won’t let it, either. Be confident, not cowed or apologetic in your answer, and remember: make it about them.Can I convince you to get some support for yourself about your past?

The friend who advises you to, say, stay in your relationship or leave your job may well be looking out for you but she’s inescapably looking out for herself, too, whether she realises it or not. Maybe she believes her own marriage was a case of settling, and wants you to join the club. Maybe she adores your company so much she could never recommend a career step that might involve your leaving town.Moreover, research suggests that, in the absence of incentives to the contrary, people will generally advise you to act more cautiously than they would act themselves in a similar situation – perhaps because they don’t want it on their conscience if you take a daring leap and fall flat on your face.There’s a happy flipside to this, though, for parents, teachers, managers and anyone else who finds themselves in the position of needing to motivate others: far better than giving them advice is to give them the opportunity to give advice. That’s the conclusion of a new study by psychologists at the universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania, who found that American middle-school pupils were much more enthusiastic about doing their homework after dispensing advice on the topic to younger children, as compared with after receiving advice from teachers. This motivational effect lasted weeks, and was also observed among adults who were attempting to lose weight, save money, control their temper or find a job. Teach a man to fish and he’ll know how to fish – but get him to teach others how to fish, and he might actually get on with some damned fishing.This result isn’t all that surprising, I suppose, when you consider how flattering it feels to be invited to give advice. (Frankly, it’s only slightly less ego-boosting to give it anyway, even when not invited.) Faced with a challenge, we tend to assume we need to seek advice in order to obtain more knowledge about how to proceed yet the truth, very often, is that we know exactly what we need to do – we just lack the confidence to do it. The act of giving advice reacquaints us with the knowledge we already possess, which instils confidence, which motivates action.This, by the way, is another good reason to keep a journal: you can use it to advise yourself. Your friends may have limited patience with your habit of lecturing them on their lives in order to feel better about your own (I know mine do!), but a leather-effect notebook never complains.Finally, this is a reminder that there are few bigger compliments you can pay another person than to ask, preferably sincerely, for their advice. Benjamin Franklin famously observed that to ingratiate yourself with someone, it’s better to ask for a favour than to perform one: the favour-doer will come to think of you as the decent and likable sort for whom they do favours.The same surely applies to advice: rather than giving it, ask for it. Though I should add that if you have any insights on this matter yourself – what with you being such a wise and thoughtful person, with such rich life experience – I’m definitely all ears.

Could the answer be to put ourselves out there more? We challenged standup Tessa Coates to find outWhen asked if I’d take on a week of challenges designed to help me open up my life to others, I saw “throw a dinner party” on the list of activities and said yes without reading the fine print. That, friends, is how I found myself running with a gang of overly enthusiastic joggers to an allotment on a dark Monday night, weeding a vegetable patch, and then running back.I wanted to learn something about myself during my week of sharing challenges. Reader, I learned that, while I am too often a cynical husk of a woman, I can be rehabilitated. And if I can, you can.Challenge one was at the Castle Canteen at the Crossway Christian Centre in Elephant and Castle, where volunteers make a free lunch once a week for anyone who wants it, from donated surplus food. Unquestionably a wonderful project, I was absolutely dreading it my catering experience starts and ends at being told off for eating the canapés and being sent home for backchat, while my volunteering experience starts and ends at being told off for not listening during the safety talk – and then being sent home for backchat. I had a heavy heart.To my delight, the Castle Canteen is run by a brilliant lady named Emily, who’s a professional chef. Nobody sent me home and everyone said I did a good job chopping the mange tout. When our lunch guests started to file in, my unsociable side wanted to stay at my chopping board. If I wasn’t there as part of a challenge, I might well have. But I forced myself to go out and find a seat, wondering how to find common ground.“Hello lovely lady, you’re new, what’s your name?” was the immediate greeting. A fantastic woman called Stella had me laughing in minutes, introducing me to a teacher, a musician and an ex-jockey. Conversation flowed, everybody had a story. It pulled at my heartstrings to see people light up with someone to talk to.That evening, I met a group of 30, all running with the social fitness group GoodGym, to help out with a gardening project. You meet for a run, do half an hour’s work, and then run back. The cynic in me was wearing away, fast. Who was I to make sassy comments when there are people out there trying to do something genuinely good?Next, I put a note under my neighbours’ door asking if they’d like to come round for some wine. Not the ones downstairs – we’d had an altercation over a plant pot 18 months ago and no one’s gotten over it – but the ones above. I explained the challenge, which made things less awkward, and next minute they were all round, new baby in tow. Suddenly we’re all laughing at the kitchen table, as if we lived in some kind of Mediterranean utopia.The dinner party, to which I was supposed to invite people from different parts of my life, made me very anxious. I rarely mix friends because I am not a natural hostess, and get so nervous that people won’t have a nice time that I inevitably ensure they don’t. But I swallowed down my whirlwind of nerves, invited friends who’d never met each other, gave them a glass of wine, and listened to them talking while I tried not to burn myself in the kitchen. “Why have we never met before?” they kept shouting at me. Honestly, I don’t know.I’ve realised that it’s easier to roll your eyes at the back than it is to get involved, but not nearly as fun. If we dig deeper, there’s probably something in there about fearing rejection. Regardless, I’m officially taking off my big cynical hat.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left. Finally, coat with a thin topping of breadcrumbs: this grabs any remaining moisture to stop the sponge going soggy. Set this fruity construction aside.Now, make the sponge. Into a mixing bowl, place your butter. If it isn’t already really soft, stick it in the microwave until it’s just-about-melted-but-not-quite. If you’re snobbish enough not to own a\u0026nbspmicrowave, stick the bowl of butter over a bowl of hot-not-boiling water.Once the butter is very soft, add in your sugar and give them a quick stir together with a wooden spoon. Don’t bother creaming them. Once combined, add in your egg and give the mix a beat until it’s smooth. Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides.

The former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre criticised Rusbridger in his lecture on Sunday night.“His record on investigations in the public interest was exceptional, a model for how to hold the powerful to account,” Viner said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9decace90bb0a15a7e8889e2046f27a3ce61b2be/0_72_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02a76ce2cdd66493d5bfd7d4376ac655","title":"support guardian readers future journalism","story":"By supporting our journalism, you can become part of a global community of over a million  readers with a shared set of core values and a vision for a more hopeful worldThank you to the 1,000,000  readers who have offered us their support over the past three years.

But it turns out they’re more politically vocal than most pop phenomenaSequestered in the corner of an east London restaurant, Clean Bandit are having a hard time describing their fans. “Age-wise, it’s very broad,” says cellist, producer, and de facto front-person Grace Chatto. “It doesn’t feel like it’s any particular type of person – it’s just a big group of, er, random people,” laughs producer Jack Patterson. With a frankly ludicrous 4bn global streams making them one of the UK’s most successful bands, their difficulty in finding a neat catch-all is pretty understandable.In accordance with modern pop rules, these fans have given themselves a collective noun – “fandits” – and while Grace is adamant that they’re “really nice” and “don’t battle with other fandoms”, Patterson is reminded of a more sinister experience. “This one fan wrote to all my friends saying she had a dark secret about me,” he says, pushing the dregs of a caesar salad around his plate. “Then she sent a photo that was meant to be proof of something,” laughs his brother Luke, the group’s drummer. “But it wasn’t even you.”It is a telling anecdote from a band who have maintained near anonymity (Jack says he often gets mistaken for the tennis player Andy Murray) in the face of huge success. Their 2014 Jess Glynne-assisted, Grammy-winning Rather Be alchemised the band’s fusion of classical and handbag house into a million-selling single, spending four weeks at No 1 and gatecrashing the US Top 10. It was followed by four more Top 10 singles and then, in 2016, by Rockabye’s ludicrous conjoining of dancehall, a near 400-year-old nursery rhyme and Sean Paul rapping about single mums. It spent nine weeks at No 1 in the UK and took the Christmas top spot. Rockabye features on their restlessly inventive second album What Is Love?, which, as well as containing two more chart-toppers (string-drenched weepie Symphony, featuring Zara Larsson, and the juddery electro of Solo alongside Demi Lovato), also comes with a genre-agnostic, Spotify-friendly gaggle of collaborators, from Ellie Goulding to Stefflon Don, via Craig David, Rita Ora and Outkast’s Big Boi.The group have spearheaded a new kind of Avengers-style pop, with multiple star turns helping lesser-known artists such as Benny Blanco, Jonas Blue and Tiësto to the upper reaches of the charts. But Clean Bandit remain ultimately reliant on the mercurial pizzazz of proper pop stars front of house, so what are people’s perceptions of them as a band? “They don’t have any perceptions,” says Grace. “I still feel like most people don’t know much about us,” shrugs Luke.While the perception is that Clean Bandit arrived seemingly fully formed and focus-grouped with Rather Be, they enjoyed the early hustle, gigging constantly and hosting their own club night, National Rail Disco. Back in London, it was Grace who would constantly harangue MTV to ask why it wasn’t playing the self-directed video for Mozart’s House. When she was told it would only play it once the song had some traction on radio, she found a radio plugger and gave him the equivalent of a month’s rent in cash. “We couldn’t even afford to get the tube at that point,” she remembers. “Within a few weeks, Radio 1 was playing it and then, all of a sudden, all these lawyers and managers contacted us.”They signed to a major label, Atlantic Records, in 2012 and the re-released Mozart’s House peaked at No 17 a year later. For a while, before the success of Rather Be, they planned to focus solely on making videos and started a production company called Clean Film in 2011. “Shooting videos is the most intense, full-body experience,” beams Grace. “It’s almost like a ritualistic, sadomasochistic process that we have to put ourselves through after every song’s finished,” adds Jack. “We have to self-flagellate and punish ourselves.”That’s not to say they have avoided controversy altogether. In fact, Mozart’s House cost Grace her pre-fame job. “I was teaching cello in a school and some of the kids found the video and the parents complained that it was inappropriate,” she says, referencing a section where she strolls through a car park with a violin covering her bare chest. “That notion that female skin is somehow dirty or inappropriate for children is such a bad message.” She says she was also determined to keep a scene of her masturbating in the video for Solo. “I had kickback from the label saying: ‘What if children ask their parents what’s going on?’ And I was like: ‘Well, that’s fine, if they do ask their mums, then they won’t find out from other things on the internet.’ Those scenes were important for me to put in because seeing women masturbating is not something that happens in popular culture, unless it’s with a hetero male gaze.”In October 2016, violinist Amin-Smith quit. While Grace seems genuinely sad when I ask if they had any idea he was unhappy (“He always loved doing lots of other things,” she says), she is more robust when it comes to a tweet he posted in July that criticised an interview she gave about the band’s decision to play in Israel. “I find musicians and DJs pulling out of performances there a self-defeating act,” she says. “I’m not really sure what they hope to achieve and the suggestion that playing in a country means you support the political or foreign policy of that country is ridiculous, especially if you’re not willing to play there but play in America or the UK. Me wanting to play in Israel is not me making a statement about what’s going on there.”An early version of Rockabye featured vocals by the Norwegian singer Ina Wroldsen, who had written the song about her young son under the impression that she would be the featured artist. Somewhere along the line she was swapped for label mate Anne-Marie. “That was taken out of our hands,” says Jack. “It was a terrible situation and I fought with people for a couple of months and in the end there was nothing we could do,” adds Grace. They are keen to reiterate it wasn’t anything to do with Anne-Marie herself (“She’s one of our favourite singers at the moment”), but the fallout almost led to Grace quitting the band. “I did feel like I couldn’t do it any more because the idea that my business was hurting people … that was really painful. I went completely crazy for a while after that. I just had to carry on, but inside it was really hard.”Famous yet faceless identity-free yet politically active detached yet deeply passionate about what they do, Clean Bandit remain one of the strangest entities in British pop. “On paper it does sound like a car crash,” says Grace. “There was never any plan, though. This was kind of an accident.”• What is Love? is released on 30 November on Atlantic This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Not a hit, for some reason.You could see why Bush chose to trail the Director’s Cut album, where she reinterpreted songs from her back catalogue, with Deeper Understanding – its lyric about the isolating effects of technology seems weirdly prescient for a song from the 80s. But it’s one instance where the original, replete with ethereal vocals by Trio Bulgarka (subsequently swamped by a guest appearance by Bush’s son, Bertie), is better.A forgotten and atypical Bush single – a straight orchestral reading of the Great American Songbook standard, recorded for a tribute album of Gershwin songs by the legendary harmonica player Larry Adler. Very nice, but inessential.Kate Bush had a whole album’s worth of flatly brilliant, at least vaguely festive-themed music in her – 2011’s 50 Words for Snow – but her first attempt at a Christmas single 31 years earlier fell oddly flat, never quite sounding as magical as its title suggests.Bush is no fan of her second album, Lionheart, saying in 2005: “I just didn’t like it.” Its flop lead single Hammer Horror wasn’t quite up to the standard set by her debut LP, The Kick Inside: it feels strained, as if it’s trying a bit too hard to sound kooky. That said, the dramatic orchestral arrangement is great.A single by default, not design: it charted on downloads from the soundtrack album of The Golden Compass alone. Belying Bush’s reputation as a pernickety studio perfectionist, it apparently took 10 days to write and record. It’s not her greatest song, but its ambient synth and choral backing is luscious and enveloping.The Red Shoes was one song vastly improved by Bush’s rerecording on Director’s Cut. The original single was fine, its lyrical exploration of the creative impulse chafing against its perky folk backing, but the new version trumped it: darker, more insistent, more powerful.It’s tempting to see Experiment IV’s lyric – about scientists impelled to make a lethal sonic weapon – as a kind of allegory for Bush’s perfectionist approach to recording and belief in music’s power. Either way, it’s a more direct and undemanding piece of music than her preceding singles, from Hounds of Love, its mid-80s sound more dated.Other countries got the extraordinary if impenetrable Suspended in Gaffa as a single from The Dreaming. In Britain, it was the less abrasive, but similarly Kurt Weill-ish There Goes a Tenner. Its shifts from am-dram oompah to hypnagogic ambience are suitably unsettling and odd.The last single that Bush put out before her 11-year absence from the release schedules is suitably downbeat – “whatever happens, what really matters?” – and decorated with guitar solos by Eric Clapton. It’s another track improved by its Director’s Cut makeover, its glossy feel replaced with something mistier and more touching.It seems odd to think of how Bush was once popularly perceived: not with the reverence she’s held in now, but as a dippy space cadet with a penchant for saying “wow”. Then again, The Big Sky is essentially a song about how nice clouds are. Still, its wide-eyed glee is genuinely infectious.Seemingly released as a single to disabuse anyone who thought 50 Words for Snow might be a straightforward Christmas album, Wild Man deals with sightings of the yeti, features both Andy Fairweather-Low, pretending to be a Nepalese mountain-dweller, and an addictive, insistent guitar riff.Cut from a similar musical cloth to The Big Sky – percussion-heavy, giddy – Love and Anger might be the most bizarrely upbeat song ever written about a relationship curdling because of a partner’s refusal to say what they really mean. You’re left unsure if the problem is a dark secret or just passive aggression, but the music is transcendent.Another of the songs re-recorded on Director’s Cut, The Sensual World was fine to start with: a little oblique for a single, perhaps, but its drowsy flow of erotic, James Joyce-inspired imagery works spectacularly well. Classic only-Kate-Bush-would-do-this twist: it’s interpolated with traditional Macedonian music played on the uilleann pipes.As straightforwardly pop as Bush ever got, famed for a video that looks like a dream a Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons-playing pervert once had, Babooshka is still irresistible: its howled chorus unshakeable, the sound of smashing glass presaging 80s sample-mania.The one undisputed classic on Lionheart. It’s hard to imagine anyone other than Bush making a subject as ordinary as an underemployed, second-rate actor – “he’ll never make The Sweeney” – quite so eerie and epic, beautifully drawing the gulf between the gushing praise of his friends and the lonely reality of his life.The Red Shoes was an album frequently haunted by loss, never more so than on this moving piano ballad, on which Bush listed dead friends by name, quoted adages used by her late mother and concluded: “Just being alive – it can hurt so much.”Comeback album Aerial wasn’t exactly overburdened with obvious singles. Perhaps the beautiful, sunlit Somewhere in Between might have worked out of context of the Sea of Honey song-suite, but instead Bush plumped for a song that involved her impersonating Elvis and knowingly ruminating on the benefits of withdrawing from the public eye.There were a lot of songs about nuclear war around in the early 80s, but few as strange and bewitching as Breathing, written from the point of view of a fully sentient foetus. Five episodic minutes long, blessed with a gorgeous chorus and a spoken-word section describing a nuclear blast, it signalled that Bush had seized artistic control of her career.When the audience at one of her 2014 shows sang along to Cloudbusting, Bush was moved to exclaim: “Oh, what a lovely song!”, as if she hadn’t written it herself. She was right: powered by its string arrangement, Cloudbusting twists and turns dramatically, before reaching its final euphoric refrain.It says something about the sheer weirdness of The Dreaming that someone thought Sat in Your Lap was its most commercial track. Even in a pop climate where the Associates’ Party Fears Two could become a hit, this sounded thrillingly unhinged: three and a half minutes of screeching vocals, frantic PiL-influenced rhythms and Fairlight-driven sampling overload.Widely thought of as a disappointment, accompanied by a film she later described as “a load of old bollocks”, The Red Shoes LP nevertheless has its moments, not least its lead single: angular, life-affirming funk perhaps displaying the influence of Prince, who declared Bush his “favourite woman” and appeared elsewhere on the album.Subtly affecting, promoted with a supremely bizarre performance on German TV – involving a rubber-glove-sporting Bush sweeping the stage while dressed as a cleaner – Army Dreamers demonstrates the influence of folk music on her work. Its anti-war message is straightforward, but its eerie mood gets under your skin and into your bones like cold weather.Like a lot of Bush tracks, Hounds of Love looks faintly ridiculous on paper (the hook is provided by backing vocalists barking like dogs), but the reality is sublime. The moment when its mood of pregnant fear finally shifts into one of gleeful surrender – “don’t let me go, hold me down” – is one of the most jubilant in Bush’s catalogue.It’s hard to get across how extraordinary the swooping vocals and gothic romance of Wuthering Heights sounded on arrival, like nothing else in the pop landscape of the time, or indeed before it. Bush had to resort to tears to persuade her label to release it as her debut as an opening statement of iniduality, this takes some beating.Charged with the unpromising task of writing a song to order for the US romcom She’s Having a Baby, Bush came up with this: a sparse, moving meditation on loss, regret, female strength and male frailty. There’s almost nothing to it beyond her piano and her voice, which is all you need.Coming up with The Man With the Child in His Eyes – lushly melodic, at turns creepy and erotic, mysterious and alluring – would be an astonishing achievement at any age. The fact that Bush was 13 when she wrote it was perhaps the earliest sign she wasn’t just a singer-songwriter but an actual, no-further-questions genius.For all her hits, there is a sense in which Kate Bush is not a singles artist: you can’t really get a sense of the scope and depth of her albums via the singles taken from them. But if you were forced to choose one song that encapsulates her uniqueness, you should choose Running Up That Hill, a hit in 1985 and (remixed) in 2012, and a track that simultaneously functions as pop and something infinitely stranger. Its sound is ghostly and faintly sinister – an ominous cloud of synthesiser hangs in the background weird, garbled backing vocals crash in out of nowhere – but its chorus is exhilarating and euphoric. It draws the listener inexorably into its idiosyncratic world: pop music made by someone alive to the possibilities of what pop music can be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5f17ece88884b0cc9ec9479da77bf4506c593d/0_279_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b100e3c05bfad404caf81d9c8c5fa8f1 1000w","title":"thank you consequence did alanis morissette invent wellbeing","story":"It’s twenty years since her Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie album was released - a record full of Goop theories and other prophetic elementsAsk anyone to name an Alanis Morissette album and, unless they are wearing an Alanis Morissette T-shirt, they’ll say Jagged Little Pill. Why wouldn’t they? That 1995 classic shifted 33m copies globally, won five Grammys, redefined the word “ironic” and paved the way for a glut of copycat angst merchants (Meredith Brooks, where art thou?). But perhaps it is the album’s follow-up – the solipsistic, wellness-minded Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which turned 20 this month – that holds greater influence in 2018.While its predecessor boiled with a rage that was relatable to a broader audience still reeling from grunge’s blood letting, Supposed ... turned the anger and confusion inwards and processed it via healing trips to India (lead single Thank U, essentially a four-minute prelude to Elizabeth Gilbert’s 2006 memoir Eat, Pray, Love) therapy (The Couch) and, on Unsent, which takes the form of a letter, an emotional purging. So far, so Goop. As with Ariana Grande’s current ode to her exes Thank U, Next, Unsent picks over specific relationships: not with anger, more with a “you live, you learn” (!) self-possession. While some names were changed (the opening “Dear Matthew” was thought to reference Dave Matthews, whom Alanis dated briefly in 1998), its frankness still feels like a bold statement of owning, and alchemising, one’s apparent failures.When it came time for Katy Perry to follow up her multi-million-selling Teenage Dream album, she plumped for her own version of Supposed’s yoga-scented wellness. Prism (2013) mixed gap-year spiritualism with lyrics that could have come straight from Morissette’s diary (take Love Me’s “No concealing feelings, or changing seasonally”). Rather than just chucking out a facsimile of her commercial breakthrough, Morissette set a template for female artists to sidestep expectations and carve out more interesting careers as a result (see also Lana Del Rey’s Born to Die follow-up, Ultraviolence).With Alanis tired of being pigeonholed as a man-hater, Supposed … did away with limitations altogether.

I’m sorry, I’m not going to give way to hypothetical scenarios. I’ll keep fighting for the best, most successful Brexit.”Pressed further on whether he thought the deal would be worse than staying in the EU, he replied: “Well, I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU but if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership – we’d effectively be bound by the same rules without a control or voice over them – yes, I think this would be even worse than that.”Asked about reports cabinet ministers were considering a negotiated no deal, asking the EU to give the country another year of transition and paying some money in return, Raab said: “I would certainly be up for making a best final offer and then considering no-deal deals like that but I think, in fairness, that’s not the course the prime minister has taken. I respect all of my cabinet colleagues, from those that campaigned remain to leave, and those in between.“But the reality is the deal we’ve got on the table is … I think inevitably we will see parliament vote this deal down and then I think some of those other alternatives will need to come into play.”Raab resigned last Thursday, a day after tense cabinet talks over May’s EU exit strategy, saying he could not “in good conscience” support the deal agreed by the cabinet. He singled out in his resignation letter the proposed arrangement to avoid a hard border with Ireland through a backstop arrangement, calling it a “very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom”.He added: “I cannot support an indefinite backstop arrangement where the EU holds a veto over our ability to exit.” He also said the deal amounted to a “hybrid of the EU customs union and single market obligations”.But defending May’s “bespoke” withdrawal proposals, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, told the Today programme: “I think the British public do want us to get on with it and that’s what I hear repeatedly from constituents, but what we have now is actually a very compelling deal.“This political declaration contains the instructions for negotiators for the next phase to basically deliver an economic relationship between the UK and the EU which will be stronger and closer than any other advanced economy has with the EU. That didn’t look possible a few months ago. We’ve come an awful long way since then and, as I say, this is a very strong proposition.”May is set to attend a crunch summit of EU leaders on Sunday where it is hoped her deal will be endorsed.Hinds, who backed remain during the referendum, added: “This is a political commitment and we’re going to have 27 nations coming together on Sunday to consider it and to commit to it and it is basically about how that future relationship is going to be shaped. It’s the legal position with the EU, that they can only negotiate with a country when it’s not a member so we’ll be negotiating on that after we’ve left.“But the framework is there. Actually, there’s quite a lot of detail, more detail and more ambition than many people were expecting and it does mean that we’ll have that very close economic relationship with it but still being able to strike our own trade deals around the world. That is explicit in the text, and also making sure we deliver firmly on the instruction from the British people in the referendum on things like ending free movement. We can move to a skills-based immigration system, out of the common agricultural policy, out of the common fisheries policy but in a way which is good for our economy and good for people’s jobs.”Asked about reports of cabinet colleagues discussing an alternative no-deal strategy, he replied: “There are no leavers and remainers. From the moment the referendum was over we all have a duty to deliver on the clear instruction that we got from the British people.”He also warned: “There’s a risk on the one hand, beyond that, of no Brexit at all. There are people who are trying to thwart Brexit, and there’s also a risk of no deal. Neither of those two things are attractive and that is why this deal, which is a strong deal, I believe will gain more and more traction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6be5e934dcc6c22819b4efd07890b24b2909405/0_143_4160_2496/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2e8363b08a32b86af3936d000ae497b","title":"leaked eu fishing rights statement heaps pressure on may brexit","story":"Document says Brexit deal must protect rights of European fleets to fish in UK watersThe EU will pile further pressure on Theresa May at this weekend’s Brexit summit by declaring that the post-Brexit negotiations over fishing rights in UK waters will build on the current arrangements hated by the British fishing industry.A leaked EU statement, due to be published on Sunday, the day of the summit, says it expects such a deal to be agreed by July 2020, and that it must protect the current rights of European fishing fleets to exploit British waters.It goes on to warn that a failure by the British government to come to an agreement could jeopardise any hope of extending the transition period.Such an extension is likely to be needed by the British government to allow comprehensive trade talks to develop, and to avoid the backstop arrangements for Northern Ireland kicking in, which would see a regulatory border drawn between it and the rest of the UK.The EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is deeply unpopular with the UK fishing industry, which wants Britain to be negotiating access and quota rights as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.The Conservative party’s 13 Scottish MPs – including the Scottish secretary, David Mundell – warned the prime minister last week that anything less than this would be a “betrayal of Scotland”.The prime minister has insisted the “the fisheries agreement is not something we will be trading off against any other priorities”.But the 26-page political declaration published on Thursday did make a link between European access to British waters and the terms of a wider economic deal.The leaked EU statement, to be issued by the 27 heads of state and government, goes even further in undermining Theresa May’s claim.The document, which also asserts the EU’s intention to keep the UK “dynamically aligned” to its environment policies, including its climate change targets under the Paris 2030 agreement, says the EU “will demonstrate particular vigilance on the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions and to protect fishing enterprises and their communities”.The statement says: “As recalled in the withdrawal agreement, a fisheries agreement is a matter of priority and should build on, inter alia, existing reciprocal access and quota shares. Such an agreement will be negotiated before the end of the transition period.“When the union position to be taken in the joint committee relates to the extension of the transition period and the review of the protocol on IrelandNorthern Ireland, the council will act in accordance with the European guidelines.“Any decision on the extension of the transition period will take into account the fulfilment of obligations by the United Kingdom under the agreement, including its protocols.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said that the inclusion of such language in the political declaration had been explicitly rejected and there was no commitment to maintaining existing access.However, the EU’s stated intention will bind its negotiators during the talks in the transition period, and the threat to block an extension of the transition period will heighten the political temperature around the issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/287516e7897bad36b74c258dcd688f191d310571/935_84_2565_1539/master/2565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d46257890dec290d4406f2f97844c1b","title":"may refuses to stake leadership on brexit vote","story":"PM ducks question of whether she will stake leadership on Commons voteTheresa May has refused to rule out resigning if her Brexit deal fails to gain approval in the Commons, saying she is focused on persuading MPs that the country supports the deal.During a public phone-in on BBC Radio 5Live, the prime minister was asked three times to clarify whether she would stake her premiership on the result of the parliamentary vote.“I’m not thinking about me,” she said. “I’m thinking about getting a deal through that is good for the country. My focus is on getting this deal through.”May has previously said there was a threat of “no deal or no Brexit” if MPs failed to vote in favour of the deal.“Personally, there’s no question of no Brexit, because the government needs to deliver on what people voted for in the referendum in 2016,” she said.May suggested MPs could change their mind if they listened to the mood of the country.“In a sense, I think there’s two conversations going on at the moment,” she said. “In parliament there’s a lot of focus on who’s going to vote for the deal or not, and outside I think people are thinking: ‘Actually, let’s make sure we can get this through and get on with delivering’.“My job is to persuade people. I believe this is the right deal for the UK. My job is to persuade people in parliament of that view,” she said. “And I think the job of an MP is actually, when they come to look at voting for this deal, to say to themselves, ‘Does it deliver on what people voted for?’ – I believe it does – and secondly, ‘What do we need to focus on for our constituents, for people up and down the country?’”May’s spokeswoman told journalists earlier on Friday that cabinet ministers would be engaging widely with the electorate in the coming days, with Philip Hammond and Liam Fox visiting Northern Ireland.May rejected the idea that a better deal could be secured through further negotiation. “If this deal doesn’t go through we are back at square one. What we end up with is more uncertainty and more ision.“I believe that if we were to go back to the European Union and say: ‘People didn’t like that deal, can we have another one?’ I don’t think they are going to come to us and say: ‘We will give you a better deal.’ This is the deal that I think works for the UK.”May was also asked whether she truly believed the UK would be better off outside the EU. She said the end of free movement and ending annual payments to the EU were examples of ways the country could be better off.“I think we will be better off in a situation outside the EU where we have control of all of those things and are able to trade around the world,” she said.In answer to one caller, May admitted the Brexit negotiations were keeping her up past midnight most nights, but if the deal was passed she would celebrate with her husband, Philip. “We will have a drink together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52143b8a752163cb3b90f9d3861b3ef4ab335e0e/0_59_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a95d1f27cfa8a1605517ac5d6e2b037","title":"hastings benefits desperation charities welfare advice","story":"As Amber Rudd takes over universal credit, advisers in her constituency tell of deep crisis“When we save this many lives, something is going very wrong with the welfare system,” said Jacky Everard. She and her staff are not nurses, doctors or counsellors, but their role is increasingly about easing desperate clients back from the brink of suicide, Everard said.Everard, the chief executive of the Hastings Advice and Representation Centre (Harc), compiled a client report in the summer, which found that out of 100 clients surveyed, seven said they would have killed themselves without the charity’s help.The report is an upsetting read, Everard admitted, but she is also upset. She has been a social security benefits adviser for 40 years and never witnessed such despair and unremitting crisis.Everard’s staff are trained to help people claim benefits, but clients routinely arrive at Harc’s office in a converted church in a fragile mental state. Their distress is caused or made worse by a welfare system that bullies and humiliates them, and leaves them destitute, she said.Increasingly, the job of advisers is not just to sort out money or housing problems, but to offer clients hope and emotional support.Or, as Everard put it, to light their path back from the edge. This is new. Six years ago, none of the clients they surveyed mentioned suicide.“That we need to save this many lives, keep this many people from total despair, is a perverse incentive of recent welfare reforms,” Everard wrote in the foreword to the survey. “No one should be pushed to the brink of suicide by the welfare system set up to support them in times of sickness and need.”Everard sent the report to her MP, Amber Rudd, in July. Last week, Rudd became work and pensions secretary following the resignation of Esther McVey, and she is now in charge of the benefits system. Hastings, said Everard, is a good place to find out exactly what is going wrong with welfare.Located on the south-east coast of England, Hastings is a mix of faded Victorian elegance and grim poverty. There is some affluence, driven in part by “down from London” arrivals who are helping fuel a thriving cultural scene. But there is also extreme deprivation. Unemployment is high. Housing insecurity and homelessness is endemic, and rough sleeping is rising.One of Rudd’s first acts as work and pensions secretary was to acknowledge there were problems with universal credit, which has been eight years in the making and is six years behind schedule. Her mission, she said, was to fix it and deliver a “fair, compassionate and efficient” benefits system.That is easier said than done. Tracy Maietta, 40, described being trapped in an endless cycle of assessments to qualify for personal independence payments, a benefit awarded to help chronically ill and disabled people meet the extra costs of living, as “hell”.Maietta, a former housing officer, had to retire when a cluster of health conditions made work impossible. Despite a 500-page folder of medical evidence attesting to her incapacity, the private assessors hired by the Department for Work and Pensions repeatedly turned down her applications.She appealed successfully each time. “At the last tribunal, I put the 249 pills I have to take daily into a tub and held it up. I didn’t know how else to show them,” she said. Her experience has been one of indignity, humiliation and endless hostility. “I feel judged constantly. I’m not saying I want people to look after me, but I do want someone to show empathy,” she added.Another Harc client, Laura, in her late 30s, fought back tears as she spoke about her experience of universal credit. A collapse put her in hospital, where she nearly died after contracting sepsis. Laura was a successful businesswoman before becoming ill. She is physically fragile and, to her bitter frustration, cannot work.What advice would she give Rudd? “There is no a simple tick-box solution. Remember we are human beings,” she said.The leader of Hastings borough council, Peter Chowney, said universal credit austerity cuts had led to increased homelessness in the town. Chowney stood for Labour against Rudd in the 2017 general election. Her majority was 346. About 10,000 voters are expected to move on to universal credit from next year, he noted.Everard welcomed a report into UK poverty last week by the UN rapporteur Philip Alston, who described the “misery” of an increasingly remote and punitive benefits system. Rudd called his report “highly inappropriate”, but Everard disagreed. “He recognised our truth. What he said is happening,” she said.Maietta said the benefits system needed more than technical fixes and had to be more humane and understanding of people’s lives. “The people at the top don’t realise it isn’t working, It’s just two separate worlds. They just do not live anywhere near our world. They don’t know what it is like to go to a food bank,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ecda40d3a620c168ba622b3b5dd79cdee3b5e0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f343c7cfad53a86c3318ffd4b243248","title":"study shows 60 of britons believe in conspiracy theories","story":"Leavers more likely to doubt immigration figures and think there is a plot to make Muslims the majority in UKSixty per cent of British people believe at least one conspiracy theory about how the country is run or the veracity of information they have been given, a major new study has found, part of a pattern of deep distrust of authority that has become widespread across Europe and the US.The figures were the result of a large-scale international project conducted over six years and in nine countries by researchers at the University of Cambridge and YouGov, funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The study was the most comprehensive examination of conspiracy theories ever conducted, and marks the first time academics have explored questions of conspiracy beliefs, social trust and news consumption habits across different countries.The researchers also found:Prof John Naughton, the director of the press fellowship programme at Wolfson College and one of three University of Cambridge professors who led the research, said the study, which began in 2012, had been born out of an attempt to look at the “natural history” of conspiracy theories.The researchers had tried to be as broad as possible in their definition of the term as “a theory that some actors have conspired to do something covertly, usually something dysfunctional or evil”. As part of the study, they polled respondents about 10 theories, all of which had emerged from their research, in order to test how widely they were held.That dismissive attitude changed after the Brexit vote and the election of Trump in 2016, he said. “Whatever else you think of Trump, he is a born conspiracy theorist. Trump was a kind of catalyst, in that somehow his election had the effect of mainstreaming conspiracy theories.”In fact, the prevalence of conspiracy beliefs in human societies suggests they may have a function, said Naughton. “It’s a way of trying to make sense of a complex and confusing world for an ordinary citizen.”Dr Hugo Leal, one of the project’s researchers, said he and the other academics had been startled by the proportion of Trump and Brexit supporters who said they believed the grand replacement theory.He said: “This is intertwined with a broader conspiratorial outlook, which seems to link the Trump and Brexit camps. Indeed, both sides share attitudes and sentiments that transcend the mere conservative ideological affiliation. Our study shows that conspiracy theories are a central element to understanding a common political culture, which most scholars find hard to fathom.” Leal described the shared attitudes as a “transatlantic conspiratorial axis”.More than 11,500 people were surveyed online by YouGov across nine countries: France, Germany, the UK, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and the US. The British sample size was 2,171 adults, which was weighted to be representative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

Huw Jones, fresh from his audacious double offload for Peter Horne’s try against South Africa last week, starts at outside-centre while Stuart Hogg and Sean Maitland are joined in a electrifying back three by the Edinburgh youngster Blair Kinghorn.And Laidlaw is expecting fireworks at Murrayfield on Saturday. The Clermont Auvergne scrum-half said: “It’s brilliant to be part of such a tantalising backline. It’s up to myself and the forwards to produce the ball that the boys can use out wide, whether it be Hoggy, Sean or young Blair.“I’m also looking forward to starting beside Adam. He’s obviously a young exciting player coming in. He’s been playing well at Glasgow and has also come on to play late in a few Tests off the bench.“He started in the summer against Argentina and I think that will stand him in good stead going into the game. It’s really exciting and hopefully having myself inside him and Finn on the outside will help him grow into the game. There’s some similarities between him and Finn for sure. He’s very positive and likes to play.”Laidlaw, however, admits Scotland must be careful they do not end up shooting themselves in the foot. “We need to be careful to play at the right time and in the areas. That’s part of my job. We have a strategy in place that we’ll try to implement.”Scotland dished out a six-try lesson to the Pumas in Argentina during the summer as they ran up a record 44-15 triumph. Mario Ledesma has since replaced Daniel Hourcade as head coach since that disaster in Resistencia but Laidlaw believes the Argentinians will focus on memories of that defeat as they run out in Edinburgh.Asked if he felt the visitors would be out for revenge, he said: “They won’t be too happy with the way the result went over in Argentina. But it’s a different game, Argentina have been playing well in the Rugby Championship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722b0ad14c959779c8af82d2977f5a83405dd715/0_193_4064_2440/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa3d9a1a66e03e178fc37bb4e79648c","title":"talking horses farewell to luca cumani a dignified big race winner","story":"His first Derby winner was an expensive experience for some but it’s easy to admire the retiring Newmarket trainerAch, what a pity that Luca Cumani’s final runner could not be a winner. Swansdown finished strongly but too late at Wolverhampton last night, giving the veteran trainer one last taste of the job’s frustrations. Perhaps that’ll make it very marginally easier for him to walk away.Luca and I got off to the rockiest of starts, 30 years ago. Needless to say, the fault was entirely mine. On Derby day in 1988, I layed Kahyasi to some kid who happened to be in my French class at Craigmount High School in a particularly hideous example of childhood gambling which ought to have been prevented.I don’t think I had a strong opinion on the race but got annoyed by this boy’s insistence that Kahyasi would win and therefore took the opposite view. Oh dear. Still, there’s some value in learning these lessons at an early stage. My English teacher, Mr Carson, was equally convinced Red Glow was a good thing but, alas, I didn’t offer to take a bet from him, which would have balanced the books a bit. Instead, I was cleaned out for weeks because Kahyasi paid 11-1.Cumani was well established as a big name even then Tolomeo had won the Arlington Million five years earlier. I really ought to have known better. When I eventually made it to Epsom to see a Derby in the flesh, he won that too, with High-Rise, similarly underestimated at 20-1.As he steps out of the game, his training ability is just one of the qualities to admire. I was always impressed by the very dignified way in which he carried himself, in good times and bad. He set a fine example in his commitment to his employees when Sheikh Mohammed Obaid took his horses away three years ago, causing something of a crisis in the Newmarket yard.Another man might simply have accepted that he needed fewer people about the place. Cumani committed himself to rebuilding the business so that that wasn’t necessary. “We just rode it out,” he told the Racing Post recently. “It’s not the fault of the staff. I wouldn’t want to take it out on them.” Good luck to Luca Cumani for a long and happy retirement.Turning to Ascot today, there’s some appeal in the 4-1 about Flying Tiger (3.50). Nick Williams’s horse sprang a surprise in the Fred Winter last year and continued to show quality last season, notably when third in the Fighting Fifth. It looks like he won’t make a chaser but he’s very interesting back in a handicap hurdle, having dropped half a stone since he was last tried in such a race back in April. The market prefers Chatez but I think he’d like more juice in the ground.The staying handicap chase is very open and I wonder if Battle Of Shiloh (3.15) could be the solution, bearing in mind that he has been consistently good when fresh. Evidently something went amiss when he was last seen, being pulled up in December, but he’s well handicapped if able to run to form again now and I tend to think he wouldn’t be running here if that were not the case. He’s 11-2.At Ffos Las, there’s 5-2 about Penn Lane (2.50), whose first bit of handicap form is now warm to the touch. That was at Huntingdon in January, when he was a close second to First Assignment, who has won twice at Cheltenham this autumn and is now two stones higher than he was at Huntingdon. Penn Lane is up 6lb himself but there’s every reason to hope he’s got a few pounds in hand and can get the better of Gardiners Hill, whose wins have been over fences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9047adcdc6c4d6c96dac2048e72e360ebba1e/0_56_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143f0907b1e988c2820548d69bf6466d","title":"share your experiences of christmas festivities overseas you could win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us how you spent Christmas on a trip to anywhere in the worldYou may have been to an inspiring Christmas concert, eaten local fare, taken part in unusual festivities in a far-off land – or spent the day on a remote tropical beach.Wherever you were in the world, please share your tales of a Christmas spent overseas.Please be specific about locations, and include prices and websites where appropriate.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d10bd4e3ebfd433ec04444ae50a9b47bdf05afe/93_274_4711_2826/master/4711.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3bd6de3c8a7acf7c3ea9cbc17eb4bdf","title":"catholic priests issued with photo cards to confirm their identities","story":"New system in England and Wales replaces letters of recommendation in LatinCatholic priests in England and Wales are being issued with photo cards, ending the days when a dog collar and an air of piety were enough to confirm their credentials.The plastic, credit card-sized document includes a passport-style photograph of the priest, an expiry date and a barcode, which, when scanned, provides information on the holder. The cards are signed by the bishop of the priest’s diocese.They replace traditional letters of commendation written in Latin, known as celebrets, that enable travelling priests to say Mass or hear confession in other parishes or dioceses.“The church has always had a system so that priests can travel, showing that they are in good standing,” said the Rev Christopher Thomas, the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales. “It’s a very ancient system of authorisation and we’re modernising it.”He said dioceses had either issued the cards since the system was agreed earlier this year, or were in the process of doing so.

The movement has no leader and its ad-hoc barricades at tollbooths, roundabouts and fuel depots have been organised on social media.The movement, which began as a protest against rising fuel taxes, has grown into a wider outpouring over inequality, a political class seen as cut off from reality and the pro-business Macron’s persistently negative image as a “president of the rich”.Marie, 31, a childminder in the Var region of southern France, has been protesting all week at a tollbooth “People are exasperated, there is so much anger – taxes are going up, our salaries aren’t. When you work hard, it feels unfair,” she said.“My retired parents can’t make ends meet so they had to get work distributing advertising leaflets. The government isn’t listening. To me, Macron is the president of the rich, slashing taxes for the wealthy, ignoring the rest of us. Politicians are cut off from our lives.“Those in charge are one big oligarchy. The media can’t be trusted either. I’d consider voting Marine Le Pen, but the whole political class is a letdown and I wonder why I vote at all. I worry the future will be even worse for my three children than it is for me.”Two people have been accidentally killed and more than 530 injured, 17 seriously, in a week of protests and roadblocks over what one 30-year-old factory worker who has been attending roadblocks in the south of France called “a broken society where we’re counting pennies to reach the end of the month, sick of politicians who don’t give a damn robbing the poor to give to the rich”.Macron, who has built his political identity on a refusal to back down in the face of public pressure or street protests, this week called for better “dialogue” to explain his policies.The centrist president has insisted his “transformation” of France through loosening labour laws and overhauling the workings of the welfare state would benefit ordinary French people, who have been through decades of mass unemployment.But he also promised the authorities would be “uncompromising” if protests degenerated into disorder. The government this week instructed police to break up the remaining roadblocks, particularly those around fuel depots and sites of strategic importance.Speaking about events on the island, as curfews were imposed in some areas to break up protests, Macron said: “We will be uncompromising because we can’t accept the things we’ve seen.”Dominique, 50, an unemployed technician at a roadblock in the town of Martigues, near Marseille, said: “It’s about much more than fuel. The government has left us with nothing.”“There are legitimate grievances that have to be given a hearing,” he told his cabinet on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3707217.1542977878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conor pope rounds up the best black friday deals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBlack Friday  was brought to this part of the world by the Walmart-owned Asda in 2013 and by everyone else a year later. Photograph: Rob StothardGetty ImagesSome Black Friday sales started in Ireland last week and everyone from Argos to Zara is now promising discounts of anywhere between 20 and 70 per cent.Among those who have announced sales to date are:Aer Lingus: With its Black Flyday deals, the local airline wins the cute play on words award this year. It is promising €100 off some transatlantic flights – although you do have to fly as far as the west coast of the US to make the biggest savings.All Saints: The clothes retailer is offering “30 per cent off everything”, and its website is also promising free delivery on orders of over €150.Amazon:  Kindles and Echoes are selling with discounts of up to 40 per cent while some products are similarly discounted.Ancestry.ie: From now until next Monday, its DNA kits are down to €55 from €95.Argos: Deals include €480 for a sim-free Samsung Galaxy S8, which had been priced at €780. A rose gold Fitbit Charges which had a retail price of €190 can now be bought in the shop for €130. It is, however worth pointing out that – as with many other retailers – questions should always be asked about the pricing. While the Galaxy may have cost €780, it can also be found selling for around €500 in multiple locations outside of sale periods, suggesting that the discounting is not quite as profound as it might appear.Arnotts:  is not having a Black Friday sale. It is however having a Christmas Mega Event which sees 20 per cent knocked off most of its stock. There are a whole lot of impressive deals to be found on the shop floor and if you find you can’t wait until the Winter Sales which start in four or five weeks, now might be the time to shop there.Booking: The hotel booking website is promising 40 per cent off stays at its participating hotels, apartments, B\u0026ampBs, holiday homes and villas between now and November 27th with the savings to apply for a stay between December 2018 and March 2019.Boots: If you are in the market for knockdown fragrances, then Boots is definitely worth a look with many recognisable brands selling with as much as 50 per cent off. We are not entirely sure why Boots – the chemist – is selling Soda Streams but the Black Friday price of €49.99 is a lot less than the full price of €125.99 they list. The Fitbit Charge €105 – a saving of €30 – it is also €30 cheaper than the Argos sale price although it is the regular black rubber version.Brown Thomas: Just like Arnotts, BT has turned its nose up at Black Friday and is instead having a pre-Christmas sale which lasts until midnight on Monday. There is a dizzying array of high-end bags, glad rags and all manner of other stuff on offer and if you are in the market for a swish Christmas present than now might be as good a time as any to buy it there.Call of The Wild: This outdoor sports retailer has shops in Galway, Sligo and Castlebar. It is not offering discounts on Black Friday but it will give 10 per cent of its sales today to charity. It did the same thing last year and supported Ability West in Galway and the North West Hospice in Sligo.Chupi: The Irish jewelry maker has four very attractive sounding deals this weekend. If you spend more than €179 you get a free piece worth €119. Spend €489 and you get a solid gold ring worth €179 – with further enticements for bigger spenders. We like the code you have to enter to avail of the deals – “made with love”.Copeland, Louis: The most famous tailor in Ireland is offering discounts from Friday to Sunday and customers in the market for a suit or some class of smart casual wear can look forward to 20 per cent discounts.CurrysPC World:  Not so much a Black Friday “event”, but a Black Tag one. There are some great deals on offer here. There’s €250 of a 50” LG TV. Laptops, fitness trackers, speakers and a whole lot more have also been substantially discounted.Debenhams:  This retailer is running a Black Friday Spectacular with “12 days of amazing deals” – last year there were only seven days of amazing deals if memory serves us correctly. Offers will come and go each day until Monday. When we checked on Wednesday the best deals – up to 50 per cent – were to be found in women’s clothes and children’s toys. There were also big savings to be made in the Craghoppers outdoor wear brand.DID: This retailer is promising discounts of as much as 70 per cent – and if you are in need of a big ticket item and can cut the price by that amount then now will definitely be the time to buy.Eurocamp.ie: You will struggle to find a better value family holiday than a camping one. Eurocamp is promising people some early summer sun for as little as €20 per party, per night in dozens of campsites across Europe. The cheapest deals are to be found from the start of May next year to the May 24th with the prices rising in the selected sites to €40 per party, per night between May 25th and June 30th, 2019.Elverys: The sports shop is running a buy one, get one half price set of deals until the close of business on Monday.Gutter Bookshop: No Black Friday deals but – arguably – a more important message which the bookshop posted on Twitter yesterday. “Ok, as #BlackFriday frenzy starts, please remember that local independent shops can’t afford to half-price their stock right before Christmas. Try to keep a bit of money back to support local too - they pay taxes, employ staff \u0026amp they make our towns nicer places to be! #ShopLocal.”HandyHardware.ie: This palace of DIY has joined the madness with many discounts on serious looking kit. The DEWALT DCD796 XR Brushless Compact Hammer Drill Drive, for instance comes with “an ultra compact, lightweight design that makes it perfect for use in confined spaces”. The shop also tells us that the “two speed all metal transmission provides increased runtime and longer tool life with drill driver and hammer features for multiple applications.” They had us at “Hammer Drill” to be honest. The price is marked down from €612 to €236 which seems like a massive discount to us.Harvey Norman: Harvey Norman is rarely found wanting when it comes to the sales stakes so it is hardly a surprise that it is taking Black Friday very seriously. It is offering up to 30 per cent off TVs, as much as €400 off laptops, up to 50 per cent off tables and chairs and mattresses and up to 60 per cent off bedroom furniture. It is also promising to price-match its competitors.Lidl:  We like the look of the Lidl Black Friday sale which – weirdly – actually starts on Friday. The Nutribullets for €50 are very good value for money and are, Lidl say, half price. We have seen them selling for less than €100 elsewhere although never as cheap as €50. The weird looking heated shoulder pads are also half price down from €20 to €10. We also like the look of the 50” Philips smart tellies for €400 - down from €549.Littlewoods Ireland: Maybe this retailer should change its name to Hugewoods because it is promising “huge deals” on large amounts of stock. There are pages and pages of deals to scroll through so if you’re in the market for bargains you should probably have a look here.McCauley, Sam: We came across some pretty impressive sounding deals in this chemists. There is a Lancome Beauty Box Set that once cost €254 but now costs €77 and a DJI Spark Drone which was once priced at €600 is now €250.Mothercare: Babies are many things but cheap is not one of them so anything that can be done to take the sting out of the costs it to be welcomed. Mothercare’s Black Friday sale started earlier this week and runs until Monday. The Quinny Moodd 3 Piece Bundle is now €705, a saving of €359, the Comb AxissFix Plus Car Seat is €329, down from €499.99 and the Tommee Tippee Complete Feeding set is now €69.99, a discount of €130. There are also big discounts on toys and clothes for babies and their mammies.O’Briens Wine: Chances are there will be some wine drunk across Ireland over the weeks ahead which is why the O’Briens Wine Black Friday sale is so timely. There are offers on over 200 Christmas wines, bubbles and spirits.Peter Mark:  This is an area which leaves us mystified, to be honest. But €30 off the Original Mark IV ghd stylers, €25 off select ghd stylers and €25 off the incredible L’Oréal Steampod and DAFNI heated hairbrushes in salons nationwide and online might be enough to pique your interest.Ryanair:  The airline is celebrating Cyber Week with new deals being rolled out each day. When we checked on Wednesday we could have got to either Rotterdam or Manchester for €7.99.Smyths Toys: Although Irish parents are fortunate that Santa Claus takes care of many of the gifts which will be found under Christmas trees across the land this year, this retailer will probably still be quite busy in the run up to the big day. A Barbie Dream House which once cost €300 now costs €240 and there are also a lot of discounted Lego products and FIFA 19 style game available. There is a tenner off Hatchamils – which if memory serves us correctly – was the must have present a year or two ago.South William Clinic and Spa: This Dublin city spa has range of offers across treatments and gift sets but what struck us as a real bargain were the gift cards. You can buy a €100 gift card for €59 or a €500 gift card for €269.Tayto Park:  Season tickets to Tayto Park are being sold with a €50 discount on Friday.TUI: The tour operator is promising discounts of €50 per booking on short and mid-haul package holidays or an extra €100 discount per booking on holidays to Mexico.Virgin Mobile: RED is apparently the new black at Virgin Media as it continues with 12 days’ offers up to November 26th. Virgin Media TV and broadband customers can get four months free unlimited 4G data, calls and texts on a 30-day SIM only contract, a saving of €100. Non-Virgin Media customers who sign up to Broadband, TV and Phone bundles from €59 for 12 months can get a free 32” LG smart TV.Zara: These people took us by surprise by having a Black Friday sale, details of which were only made aware to us very recently. The shop is pretty cheap at the best of times so with discounts promised of 50 per cent it is worth looking out for. And it allowed us to complete our A-Z of Black Friday deals which made us eternally grateful."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mullingar Town players carried out \u0026lsquovicious\u0026rsquo assault on Daniel Sweeney after matchCommission urges landlords to put in place procedures for disposing of records once lettings concludeData Protection Commissioner says State agency and contractor Aramark breached dutiesStephen Tynan and Raymond Fitzgerald convicted of fatally stabbing Andrew GuerrineFormer DUP leader says he \u0026lsquocouldn\u0026rsquot care less about Irish language\u0026rsquo and urged compromiseIrish citizen caring for disabled son wants son and daughter to travel here from AfricaAll three remanded in custodyPresident joins 15 European heads of state and government in declaration ahead of UN conferenceCharlene (23) and Dan Donovan (49) both pleaded guilty to gun charges in family rowFamily endured \u0026lsquoemotionally draining\u0026rsquo legal fight with Eamonn Lillis over joint assetsChild and Family Agency explains motivation for taking day-old child at High CourtSinn F\u0026eacutein TD claims two convictions relating to attempts to escape from prison were unlawfulJohn Downey wanted in UK for murder of two UDR soldiers in Enniskillen in 1972Brazilian student describes Tinder date assault by \u0026lsquomonster\u0026rsquo during sentencing hearingPeter Butterly shot dead outside The Huntsman Inn in Gormanston, Co Meath in 2013Nora Hyland (31) died on operating table at Holles Street after emergency C-sectionAn A\u0026ndashZ of the bargains to be found on Friday and over the weekendEoin \u0026lsquoBomber\u0026rsquo Liston was flying from Cardiff to Cork when incident occurredFormer taoiseach expects Stormont to get back to business after Brexit \u0026lsquomess\u0026rsquo sorted"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708074.1542975040!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ex kerry footballer s nickname causes pilot to almost turn plane around","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEoin ‘Bomber’ Liston said  Kieran Donaghy \twas telling him a story when he was called by his nickname.

The commission said the collection of photo identities in the lettings process prior to a lease being agreed was raised as a concern by a number of iniduals contacting the office. The issue is among many raised in the annual report of the Data Protection Commissioner from January 1st to May 24th, the date on which the office ceased to exist ahead of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and new Irish legislation taking effect on May 25th. The new Data Protection Commission came into being on May 25th.“The DPC can see no basis for requiring photo identity at application stage (pre-tenancy) in the absence of any legitimate business reason requiring same,” it said. It considered, however, that landlords and lettings agents “may cite legitimate reasons for requesting and retaining the photo identity of a tenant renting their property, once the contract is signed”.The commission added that landlords, or their agents, should not seek PPS numbers during the initial phase of the lettings process and should only do so when the lease was being agreed.It said there was a statutory basis for a landlord or lettings agent to use the PPS numbers of tenants only for the purposes of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board. “No other use should be made of the PPSNs and they must be kept confidential.”The commission also said it considered it “reasonable for a landlord or letting agent to request supporting documentation to confirm a prospective tenant’s capacity to pay rent”. With regard to the provision of bank statements, it said removing the narrative of statements and providing running balances on an account was sufficient to demonstrate a tenant’s capacity to pay rent.“Requests for details in relation to employmentsalary may also be reasonable to confirm capacity to pay, rent. However, requesting the bank details of a prospective tenant for the purpose of lodging the rent payment, or putting utility bills into the tenant’s name, prior to a lease being agreed, is a practice of concern from a data protection perspective.”The DPC advised that the personal data of all unsuccessful applicants for rental properties “should be disposed of securely”. Manual application forms should be shredded shortly after the letting had closed, such as on a weekly basis. “In respect of email or online applications, these should be permanently deleted shortly after the letting has been closed.”The commission said that in relation to successful applicants who become tenants, it was “cognisant that personal data submitted in connection with their application is required to be held for the duration of the tenancy”.“It is recommended that a retention period is drawn up by landlordslettings agents to ensure personal data in relation to a tenancy is disposed of in a secure manner after a specified time period once a tenancy has ceased.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3707178.1542902558!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"xi jinping s power play leads from dusty caves to china supremacy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChinese president Xi Jinping spent seven years in Liangjiahe living in primitive conditions. Photograph: Mark R. CristinoEPAIn the cave in Liangjiahe where the 15-year-old Xi Jinping was sent in 1969 during the ravages of the Cultural Revolution, there is a felt mattress on a traditional heated bed known as a kang, propaganda posters, books, vacuum flasks and not much else.China’s future president spent seven years here in this desolate part of Sha’anxi province, living in primitive conditions, working the fields, digging wells and reading widely at night.Liangjiahe is such a bleak outpost it is difficult to imagine how the young Xi went from this cave of political exile to the Great Hall of the People nearly four decades later, when the Communist Party elite abolished presidential term limits to allow him to rule indefinitely and become the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.Born in Beijing in June 1953, Xi was the son of the revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun, a founder of the Communist Party who had been a vice-premier in the 1950s.During the Cultural Revolution – a 10-year purge of “impure” elements of Chinese society up to Mao’s death in 1976 – the young Xi’s family suffered terribly. Xi Zhongxun was demoted to running a tractor factory, even though he had been a close ally of Mao. Xi’s elder half-sister Xi Heping died, most likely by suicide.Xi Jinping was sent to Liangjiahe as part of Mao’s “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside” policy. He escaped several times and was punished by Red Guards, while his mother, Qi Xin, was forced to denounce her son.Despite his treatment during the Cultural Revolution, Xi did not turn on the party. Instead, he harnessed the chaos and hardship of those seven years and channelled them into his ascent to the supreme leadership.Throughout the country, people volunteer praise for him and it is clear that he is popular. “Xi Jinping’s logic is that everyone can live together. He cares about the people. It’s like\u0026nbspt\u0027ai chi, harmonious and disciplined,” says one party scholar.T\u0027ai chi is about exercise and health, but it has a martial arts element. During his ascent to power, Xi has seen off hostile factions, clearing his way to the top by removing formidable rivals such as one-time rising star Bo Xilai, former security chief Zhou Yongkang and one-time Politburo member Sun Zhengcai.There are several pictures of Xi on the cave walls from his time in Liangjiahe. Though the younger face is thinner, the determined expression characteristic of Xi today was noticeable even then. Xi has always said he “left his heart” in Liangjiahe, and it’s here that his strongman tactics began to take shape.On one cave wall, in a foretaste of the current tensions between China and the US over trade, is a poster showing two giant fists crushing US presidents Richard Nixon and Dwight Eisenhower as well as a gang of revisionists from China’s then-rival, the Soviet Union.“All countries who are against us are pests and enemies and must be cleared out,” reads the slogan, from a poem by Mao.Xi’s approach to leading China constitutes a sharp break from that of the previous administration under president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao, who seemed content to have technocrat status and focused on building the economy.After serving time as party leader in Hebei, Fujian and Shanghai, among other places, Xi finally reached the peak of power in November 2012 and currently occupies the three most senior positions in China:\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the Communist Party, president and head of the military.The vote in the Great Hall of the People last March, removing presidential term limits and enabling Xi to govern indefinitely, ended the system of collective leadership and succession introduced by former leader Deng Xiaoping after the death of Mao, with the aim of eliminating a cult of personality.The party scholar, who requested anonymity, says she believes that westerners are too hung up on the abolition of the time limit. “If we obey time limits and don’t get the best leader, then what is the point? Westerners think one, two, three, but we Chinese are happy to go one, three, then two if we get the best leader,” she says.Xi has cemented his grip on power by capitalising on public discontent about rampant corruption to punish more than 1.5 million officials, both senior “tigers” and junior “flies”. He has overseen a tightening of control and has increased pressure on dissenting voices, jailing human rights lawyers and cracking down on dissent in civil society, the media and the internet.Alexander Dukalskis, assistant professor at the school of politics and international relations at University College Dublin\u0026nbspbelieves Xi’s chief aim is for China to attain national greatness and to be respected on the international stage.“Consolidating power domestically provides the foundation to do so. When China is weak or ided internally it is not possible for it to exert as much influence internationally,” says Dukalskis.There is no inherent contradiction in Xi’s flexibility in espousing globalism and capitalism while preaching a Marxist message – China has been doing it for many years.Xi has overseen the development of a wide-ranging security state, which has seen more and more police and paramilitary security officials on the streets of all of China’s cities, and the development of all-seeing surveillance systems.At one regional university, over a holiday period, a group of classmates exchanged messages on the social network WeChat, including remarks critical of government policy. On their return to university, they were brought in by police, and their teachers had to intervene on their behalf. They were told they were banned from ever working in government.Xi has built a “Great Wall of Steel” around the restive western province of Xinjiang, where the United Nations says hundreds of thousands of Muslims are being kept in re-education camps, described by Beijing as “vocational centres” to wean young people away from extremist violence.In Hong Kong, promised a high degree of autonomy under the Basic Law governing the territory since it reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, Xi has warned democracy advocates not to cross a “red line” and undermine Beijing’s authority. “One consistent element of Xi’s tenure has been a scepticism of ‘western’ political ideas,” says Dukalskis.China’s burgeoning economy has given it influence, but Xi has added a political dimension to the mix. By espousing globalism in the face of growing US protectionism, he has positioned China as an alternative to the US, a stance that has proven popular with countries in Africa and Latin America.Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, part of the University of\u0026nbspLondon, believes that by emphasising Marxist-Leninist values and centralising state agencies, Xi and the party aim to control the economy and everything else.“But this will also mean that the party will have to get its policies right in order to avoid major problems developing. Muddling through as an option is being eroded as this process deepens,” says Tsang. “Xi believes in the superiority of the socialist system and only tolerated the capitalist bits to enable China to return to socialism with Chinese characteristics.”This could signal trouble if he undermines the dynamic private sector while building up the public sector.Back in Liangjiahe, in Xi’s cave quarters a display shows the books he read during his time there. As well as the usual Karl Marx tracts, there is Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea and Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace.The Communist Party has always loved a struggle narrative, and Xi has proven adept at embracing this legacy to serve his image of man of the people, driven by ideology but also patriotism – and his reputation as a man who succeeded in making the long journey from a dusty cave to the core of the constitution."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3708249.1542986371!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gibraltar agreement clears last hurdle to brexit summit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez: “My government will always defend the interests of Spain. If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit,” he tweeted. Photograph: Juanjo MartinEPAA last-minute Spanish threat to derail Sunday’s Brexit summit appears to have been averted by agreement by diplomats in Brussels to language which reaffirms Madrid’s veto over future EU talks which impinge on Gibraltar. Spain has yet to approve the text.The text of the clarification statement by the 27 EU states will not be part of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration, which are to be approved at Sunday’s summit, and will not have to be signed off by London.The statement is expected also to include language on fishing – the expectation that a deal will be agreed by July 2020, and that it must protect the current rights of European fleets to fish British waters – and on the possible one-year to two-year extension to the transition period.In this regard, a clear warning is issued to the UK that it must not hold back or delay in implementing commitments made in the withdrawal agreement: “Any decision on the extension of the transition period will take into account the fulfilment of obligations by the United Kingdom under the agreement, including its protocols,” the new language is reported to say.In Brussels there had been unfounded rumours that Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez, currently on a visit to Cuba, would fly in on Saturday to meet either British prime minister Theresa May or European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, who will be meeting on Saturday evening ahead of the summit.Commission sources insist the latter meeting, whose agenda is still vague, will not involve any reopening of either of the documents. Nor will the summit, officials agreed on Friday.Leaders will gather in Brussels on Sunday at 9.30am (local time) for the summit, which will initially be addressed by European Parliament president Antonio Tajani. All being well, a final press conference is scheduled for midday.On Friday the Spanish objections appeared as if they might upset the carefully choreographed show. “After my conversation with Theresa May, our positions remain far away,” Mr Sánchez tweeted in Spanish and English on Thursday night. “My government will always defend the interests of Spain. If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit.”In practice the Spanish cannot veto the withdrawal agreement, which will be agreed by leaders by a strong qualified majority vote (under the complicated formula in the treaty, that is 72 per cent of the 27 remainer member states, or 20 member states representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU27).But the leaders would strongly prefer a unanimous decision and are concerned at the prospects of Mrs May facing British newspaper headlines that suggest she was humiliated by the Spanish. Everything, sources say, should be “done and dusted” by Sunday so that she can emerge triumphant from the meeting.Spanish sources say that the dispute on Gibraltar reflects perceptions of an unwillingness on the part of the commission to privilege a Spanish vital national concern in the talks in the way that Irish national concerns and views, notably on the Border issue, were explicitly privileged. Britain’s contested sovereignty over Gibraltar is a huge domestic issue for Spanish politicians.The Spanish were particularly angered by the dropping of language from early drafts of the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp– at British instigation? – that made clear that, as the EU March 2017 negotiating guidelines agreed by leaders provided, “no agreement between the EU and the UK” could apply to Gibraltar “without an agreement between” London and Spain. An explicit Spanish veto.The EU Council’s legal service, backed by that of the commission, is understood to to have argued that that obligation is implied and still stands in the final text. Madrid says there is ambiguity and insists it wants it in writing, “to be sure, to be sure”. The deal hammered out on Friday should mean its leader can save face.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Will OliverBloombergBritain will seek the co-operation of Irish authorities in exploring technological solutions to keeping the Irish Border open after Brexit if European Union leaders approve a draft deal next Sunday.Theresa May told the House of Commons yesterday that preparatory work on alternative arrangements to avoid implementing a backstop would begin before Britain leaves the EU next March. A senior British official said that although no process had been agreed with Dublin “all customs facilitation requires work with the other side of the border so I would anticipate the same being true for these facilitations”. The prime minister’s official spokesman said that any such co-operation would be part of a commitment in the political declaration between the EU and UK published yesterday. “It commits each side to undertaking preparatory work to make sure that talks can start as quickly as possible once we’ve left the EU.” The Government has previously said that technological solutions to avoid a hard border had been “judged inadequate or unworkable”. A spokesman last night said that Dublin “has always said it is willing to consider sensible and realistic solutions that will avoid a hard border, so long as their effectiveness can be proved,” but that this would form part of the negotiations between EU and UK.“Preventing a hard border in Ireland has always been the Government’s priority,” the Government spokesman said.He added that the withdrawal agreement, a legal document, includes the “backstop” option that guarantees there would be no hard border “unless and until something better arises”. “The Government has made clear that it does not wish to use the backstop and prefers that a deep and new relationship can be negotiated, involving no hard border,” he said.The 26-page political declaration promises Britain a wide-ranging free trade agreement with the EU, without tariffs or quotas, and to maintain current levels of internal and external security co-operation.It speaks of “an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defence and wider areas of co-operation based on a balance of rights and obligations.” The document has been sent to the 27 EU other capitals and is set to be approved by the bloc’s leaders on Sunday alongside the much weightier and legally binding treaty, the withdrawal agreement.Mrs May hailed the declaration as “right for the whole of the UK” but the DUP’s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson described it as a “non-binding aspirational agreement of convenience”. Mr Wilson said the document was drafted to help Ms May “rather than mitigate the very damaging and dangerous” draft withdrawal deal.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It is not good enough.”“Given the vast scale of this content, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are simply not equipped to tackle this issue alone. Social media companies must immediately take responsibility for dealing with extremist and illegal materials on their sites.”Senior counter terror officers said they had struggled to get quality data out of the tech giants for years. “They simply don’t get it, so to take action that affects their advertising revenues would be the best thing to do,” said one ex-counter terror chief.Why firefighters have become targets for vicious mob attacksBrexit latest: Theresa May refuses three times to say whether she would resign if deal is rejected by MPsDinner for One: British comedy beloved by Germans finally gets a home premiere Comment: We must stop Gerard Batten turning Brexit into a plaything of the far rightNumber of boys with eating disorders doublesKarachi attack: Four dead as separatist gunmen attack Chinese consulatePolice warn moped criminals: We can ram you off bikes even if you aren\u0026#39t wearing a helmetBritish paraglider dies during \u0026#34acrobatic\u0026#34 flight in Swiss AlpsTommy Robinson: From masked street protester and founder of the EDL to Ukip adviserComment: Spain will exploit the Brexit chaos as much as it can to help its cherished cause to reclaim GibraltarBody found in search for missing journalist Florence WatersComment: The EU does not want a deal.

Dinner for One, starring Freddie Frinton, is so beloved that it holds the Guinness World Record for the most annually repeated show.Yet chances are you will never have heard of it because Dinner for One is broadcast in Germany, and has been every year since 1972. It is also traditional festive viewing in Denmark, Sweden and several other European countries, where audiences howl with laughter at Frinton’s slapstick performance, but has never been screened in Britain.Finally, the 18-minute film is to have a British premiere as part of a comedy film festival at the Campbeltown Picture House on the Mull of Kintyre.The screening is a posthumous honour for Frinton, a musical hall star who is a household name in several countries but not his own. He died in 1968.The sketch was written by Lauri Wylie and Frinton performed it in seaside theatres from the 1940s onwards. In 1961, a German director saw it on stage and invited Frinton to record it in front of a German studio audience.He plays James, an aged butler serving dinner to his employer, Miss Sophie (May Warden). The other guests - Admiral von Schneider, Mr Pomeroy, Sir Toby and Mr Winterbottom - are absent, and James impersonates each of them while dutifully downing their glasses of sherry, wine, champagne and port. By the end of the evening, he is royally drunk.His son, Mike Frinton, said the “quintessentially English” comedy translates to every country.“For many years we had no idea it had become so popular in Germany. Apparently it was first shown when they needed to fill a gap between programmes, and the next year it stayed in that slot. When they tried to take it off air a year or two later, there were protests,” he said.“My dad loved performing this sketch. It was a favourite. If he could slot it into a show or a panto, he did. It’s wonderful to see it play in the film festival.“I would love to see it on TV in this country but I’m not sure how well it would go down. It takes a while to warm up - it’s not something like Friends, where there’s a laugh every minute. It builds slowly and the laughs start coming about a third of the way in.”Frinton, from Grimsby, found television fame as Thora Hird’s husband in Meet The Wife, the 1960s sitcom, but his other work is less well known.His son, one of the performer’s four children, said he hoped the publicity would bring his father added recognition. “He’s not so known now, but very few comedians from that era are,” he said.“It makes us so proud that, finally, this perfect example of comedy timing can be appreciated over here. Dad would have been humbled to find himself in such illustrious comedy company.”The sketch was filmed before a live studio audience in GermanyDinner for One holds the Guinness World Record for most annual airings of a television comedy sketch, as it has now run in Germany for 45 years.It is so much a part of the national conversation that in 2011 a parody version was released called Euros For No One, with the faces of Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel super-imposed onto the bodies of Frinton and Warden.The original came to the attention of the Scottish Comedy Film Festival as organisers planned a weekend of screenings celebrating slapstick comedy. A Campbeltown local, David Mayo, mentioned that he had been introduced to Dinner for One by a colleague when working in the Netherlands around 20 years ago.Ailsa MacKenzie, festival organiser, said: “We watched it and just fell about laughing. I have a 10-year-old who thought it was the most fantastic thing ever.“It’s great to unearth these gems. Freddie was a comedy genius and the timing in this film is perfect. He doesn’t miss a beat.” Dinner for One will be shown twice and paired with Buster Keaton films.The festival runs this weekend. Other highlights include a public custard pie fight and a slapstick workshop in which participants will be taught how to execute the perfect pratfall.Please review our commenting policyWhy firefighters have become targets for vicious mob attacksBrexit latest: Theresa May refuses three times to say whether she would resign if deal is rejected by MPsComment: We must stop Gerard Batten turning Brexit into a plaything of the far rightNumber of boys with eating disorders doublesKarachi attack: Four dead as separatist gunmen attack Chinese consulatePolice warn moped criminals: We can ram you off bikes even if you aren\u0026#39t wearing a helmetBritish paraglider dies during \u0026#34acrobatic\u0026#34 flight in Swiss AlpsTommy Robinson: From masked street protester and founder of the EDL to Ukip adviserComment: Spain will exploit the Brexit chaos as much as it can to help its cherished cause to reclaim GibraltarBody found in search for missing journalist Florence WatersComment: The EU does not want a deal.

He was first pictured on social media by a fellow pupil with the message: “How’s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?”Other pictures apparently from the man’s Facebook account showed him with a moustache, facial stubble and drinking from a bottle of beer.Some parents were so concerned that they removed their children from school. The scandal prompted the school to remove the man, believed to be 6ft 1ins tall, from school.Stoke High School in Ipswich, SuffolkAlthough the Home Office refused to reveal what age he is now believed to be, it is understood from sources that he is being treated officially as an adult asylum seeker.A department spokesman said: “We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.“Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.A spokesman for the school, run by the Ormiston Academies Trust, confirmed the Year 11 pupil is no longer at the school, adding: “This is a matter for the Home Office.

If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.Why firefighters have become targets for vicious mob attacksBrexit latest: Theresa May refuses three times to say whether she would resign if deal is rejected by MPsDinner for One: British comedy beloved by Germans finally gets a home premiere Comment: We must stop Gerard Batten turning Brexit into a plaything of the far rightNumber of boys with eating disorders doublesKarachi attack: Four dead as separatist gunmen attack Chinese consulatePolice warn moped criminals: We can ram you off bikes even if you aren\u0026#39t wearing a helmetBritish paraglider dies during \u0026#34acrobatic\u0026#34 flight in Swiss AlpsTommy Robinson: From masked street protester and founder of the EDL to Ukip adviserComment: Spain will exploit the Brexit chaos as much as it can to help its cherished cause to reclaim GibraltarBody found in search for missing journalist Florence WatersComment: The EU does not want a deal.

Over the course of one month, three judges evaluated compelling evidence in three hearings.They reached their conclusions after a full and proper process. This was an extremely serious case. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood and national security must be a top priority.Mr Hedges\u0027 family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had a good conversation yesterday with our foreign minister.He stressed the two nations\u0027 close ties, adding: Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.Mr Hedges\u0027 wife Daniela Tejada confirmed she has requested clemency, as she refuted the UAE\u0027s defence of its judicial system.Matt was held in an undisclosed location in solitary confinement for over five months, with no charge, no lawyer and very limited consular access, she said in a statement.When he did receive consular access, he was not allowed to talk openly about his case and thus never received advice as to what his rights were. The judicial system in the UAE and the UK cannot be compared.I was in the courtroom and the hearing lasted less than five minutes. We have asked for clemency, we will wait to see what happens.Diplomatic efforts to free the PhD student are being led by Mr Hunt amid an outcry after the 31-year-old was jailed earlier this week.The Durham University researcher\u0027s wife said she has won assurances from Mr Hunt that the Government is now standing up for her husband, after she claimed it had initially put foreign relations above his liberty.But after a five-minute phone call with him on Thursday night, she said Mr Hedges remains in fear that he will have to serve the entirety of his sentence.He is not well. He mentioned that his panic attacks have become worse than they were before. However, he did say that he has access to a doctor, she told the BBC on Friday morning.I wasn\u0027t allowed to know where he is, so still don\u0027t know anything about his whereabouts, and I think he\u0027s just absolutely terrified at the idea of having to spend the rest of his life behind bars for an offence he hasn\u0027t committed.On Thursday Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he had a constructive conversation with his opposite number, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed, tweeting: I believe \u0026amp trust he\u0027s working hard to resolve the situation asap.After returning to the UK on Thursday, Ms Tejada met with Mr Hunt and later said she had been assured that UK officials are doing everything in their power to bring her husband home.Daniela Tejada, wife of Matthew HedgesHowever a frank statement by Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, set out the UAE\u0027s position.The UAE respects the rule of law and is committed to upholding the highest judicial standards. Like all countries with an independent judiciary it is vital that the government does not attempt to interfere in court cases, the statement said.We cannot give assurances to other countries about the outcome of trials.Mr Hedges\u0027 shock sentencing during a five-minute hearing at an Abu Dhabi court on Wednesday prompted a furious response by UK officials.Mr Hunt said he had seen absolutely no evidence to support prosecutors\u0027 allegations that Mr Hedges was spying when he visited Dubai earlier this year.He also threatened serious diplomatic consequences if the student, who is originally from Exeter, is not freed.But Mr Al Naqbi defended the court\u0027s decision, stressing the crimes Mr Hedges is accused of are extremely serious and protecting the UAE\u0027s national interests must be our first priority.The case against Hedges was thoroughly investigated by the public prosecutor, the statement said.Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies witness testaments and Hedges\u0027 own confession.The statement rejected claims that Mr Hedges was forced to sign a document in Arabic that has been used as the confession and said he was provided with translators.The minister also rejected claims that Mr Hedges had been mistreated while held in custody.Contrary to media reports, Matthew Hedges has been treated fairly and according to the constitution of the UAE. We are proud to have a system of justice that gives everyone the right to a fair trial, it said.A family representative said Mr Hedges was held in solitary confinement for more than five-and-a-half months, during which his mental and physical health seriously deteriorated.The UAE statement rebutted claims that the student had been denied visits by his family or British embassy staff and said he had access to medical and psychological care throughout.Mr Hedges, a Middle Eastern studies specialist, was arrested at Dubai Airport as he tried to leave the country on May 5.Matthew Hedges and his wife Daniela TejadaProfessor Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said there is no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research.After a hearing in October UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash said attempts had been made to address the case though common channels, although reluctance of UK authorities meant it was passed to the courts.He tweeted: Case of Mathew Hedges extensively discussed with UK colleagues over last 5 months. Unusual \u0026amp embarrassing revelations about friends \u0026amp allies.With reluctance of UK authorities to address matter thru common channels,due legal process needs to take its course.Mr Hedges was given 30 days to challenge the court ruling, and Ms Tejada on Thursday started a petition on Change.org which has gathered more than 150,000 signatures.She wrote: Matthew may be able appeal his sentence in one month\u0027s time. Before then I am begging as many people as possible to back my petition calling on the British Government to do everything in their power to ensure the UAE let my husband come home.Why firefighters have become targets for vicious mob attacksBrexit latest: Theresa May refuses three times to say whether she would resign if deal is rejected by MPsDinner for One: British comedy beloved by Germans finally gets a home premiere Comment: We must stop Gerard Batten turning Brexit into a plaything of the far rightNumber of boys with eating disorders doublesKarachi attack: Four dead as separatist gunmen attack Chinese consulatePolice warn moped criminals: We can ram you off bikes even if you aren\u0026#39t wearing a helmetBritish paraglider dies during \u0026#34acrobatic\u0026#34 flight in Swiss AlpsTommy Robinson: From masked street protester and founder of the EDL to Ukip adviserComment: Spain will exploit the Brexit chaos as much as it can to help its cherished cause to reclaim GibraltarBody found in search for missing journalist Florence WatersComment: The EU does not want a deal.

They won’t accept my BitPay, what’s the point of Black Friday sales fiat losers?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That could allow Apple to put the phone back on sale at a lower price.Apple designer Jony Ive explains his \u0027utterly absurd\u0027 way of workingThe new handsets released in September were available at an increased price compared with previous years: the new iPhone XR, pitched as the more affordable model, begins at the same price the top-end phones had been marketed at until the iPhone X came along.Instead of buying those new phones, customers have been opting for the iPhone 8, according to numerous reports. Price-conscious customers are realising they could buy last year\u0027s handset instead for a much lower cost\u0026nbsp– despite it not featuring the brand new iPhone design – and that is thought to be having an impact on sales of the more expensive models.It is not clear when the iPhone X will be re-introduced to the line-up, or even if it will make it back onto sale. The iPhone X features an almost identical design to the iPhone XS, but misses out on new features such as an improved camera and upgraded processor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Created with Sketch.The best films of 2018 (so far) Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats. But there was also the question of Europe.Created with Sketch.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlines Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track.

Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHOra\u0027s second album\u0026nbspPhoenix\u0026nbsphas received mostly positive reviews from critics.

Scientists have identified the remains as a type of dicynodont from the therapsid group\u0026nbspand have named the species Lisowicia bojani, after the Polish village of Lisowice close to where the fossils were found, and a German anatomist named Ludwig Heinrich Bojanus.Dicynodonts were herbivores and their sizes ranged from small burrowing species to large browsers. Most of them were also toothless. Despite their reptilian heritage, they are the predecessors of all modern mammals, including humans. Bones of new species of vegetarian dinosaur found in BrazilExtinction mystery deepens after discovery of dinosaur-era bird fossilBirds got their colourful eggs from dinosaur ancestors, study suggestsLargest dinosaur foot ever recorded came from brachiosaur, study findsThe new species was discovered by a team from Uppsala University in Sweden and the Polish Academy of Sciences, and their findings are published in the journal Science.“The discovery of Lisowicia changes our ideas about the latest history of dicynodonts, mammal Triassic relatives. It also raises far more questions about what really make them and dinosaurs so large, said Dr Tomasz Sulej, of the Polish Academy of Sciences.The size of the fossil means palaeontologists will have to reassess their understanding of therapsid lineage.dicynodont found in Poland (Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki)“Dicynodonts were amazingly successful animals in the Middle and Late Triassic. Lisowicia is the youngest dicynodont and the largest non-dinosaurian terrestrial tetrapod from the Triassic,” said Dr Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki of Uppsala University.“It\u0027s natural to want to know how dicynodonts became so large. Lisowicia is hugely exciting because it blows holes in many of our classic ideas of Triassic ‘mammal-like reptiles’.” The first findings of fossils from Lisowice in Poland were made in 2005 by Robert Borzecki and Piotr Menducki. Since then, more than 1,000 bones and bone fragments have been collected from the area, including fossils from Lisowicia. The area is thought to have been a river deposit during the Late Triassic period.Lisowicia bojani reveals dicynodonts - predecessors of modern mammals - grew to colossal sizes (Karolina Suchan-Okulska)The discovery of Lisowicia provides the first evidence that mammal-like elephant sized dicynodonts were present at the same time as the better-known long-necked sauropodomorph dinosaurs, contrary to previous belief. Sauropodomorphs include species like the Diplodocus or Brachiosaurus. The find fills a gap in the fossil record of dicynodonts and it shows that some anatomical features of limbs thought to characterise large mammals or dinosaurs also evolved in the non-mammalian synapsid.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

But immigration officials revoked his status after he served a 15-month prison sentence in 2013 for a tax offence.During his time in prison, the Nigerian national worked as a presenter on National Prison Radio, where he was commended as being the best prisoner-producer to have worked on the station.The attempt to deport Opelo Kgari shows how unjust our system isWoman brought to UK from Botswana as a child in deportation reprieveJamaican woman in UK since she was a child facing removalSince his release, he has presented\u0026nbspa number of programmes about prison and rehabilitation on national radio\u0026nbspand volunteered for charities that seek to deter\u0026nbspyoung people from offending.Alongside his voluntary work, the 34-year-old is primary carer for his two sons, aged three and one, while his wife Stacey, who he married five years ago, works in the civil service.But Mr Ineomo-Marcus was\u0026nbspserved a deportation notice on Monday while signing on with the Home Office. He was given no forewarning and had to wait at the reporting\u0026nbspcentre\u0026nbspfor three hours with his baby son before his wife was called\u0026nbspand told to collect her child so Mr\u0026nbspIneomo-Marcus\u0026nbspcould be taken to a removal centre.Speaking from Harmondsworth detention centre on Thursday, Mr Ineomo-Marcus said the idea of being flown back to Nigeria was “terrifying”, adding: “This is a country that I have no ties to – and the Home Office hasn’t objected to this.“I’m not able to sleep because this is hanging over me. The prospect that they could walk in and grab me and put me on a plane before I can say goodbye to anyone – not even my children – terrifies me.Ineono-Marcus\u0026nbsphas always been\u0026nbspprimary carer for his two sons, aged three and one, while his wife Stacey, who he married five years ago, works in the civil service (Stacey Ineomo-Marcus)“I am a product of British education and British culture. I’ve played in football teams, made friends, built networks within the community. I am quintessentially, de-facto British – apart from the fact that I just don’t have a little red book for a passport.”Mr Ineomo-Marcus described the crime he committed in 2013 as a “lapse of judgement”, saying he had invested £4,500 into a business set up his cousin, which – unbeknownst to him – was claiming back taxes it was not entitled to.“A crime is a crime – I am in no way trying to justify it. I did my time. But this is a form of double punishment. Prison did what it is supposed to do, he continued. I haven’t reoffended, I’ve given back to society. The probation service itself has assessed me as being low-risk of re-offending.Phil Maguire, chief executive of the Prison Radio Association, where Mr\u0026nbspIneomo-Marcus\u0026nbspworked during his time in\u0026nbspHMP\u0026nbspBrixton, described the 34-year-old as a “gifted and thoughtful communicator” who had “positively influenced the lives of many thousands of prisoners” through his work.“The quality of Hilary’s work was quite remarkable, as was his work ethic. Hilary proved to be the very best prisoner-producer we have ever had the pleasure of working alongside, Mr Maguire added.Bella Sankey, director of charity Detention Action, said Mr\u0026nbspIneomo-Marcus\u0027s\u0026nbspcase highlighted “all that is wrong with the Home Office\u0027s robotic approach to detention and deportation”.\u0026nbspShe added: “He’s been here since childhood, has repaid his debt to society and is by any measure ‘more British than foreign’.\u0026nbsp“Detaining and deporting him to a country that is not his home is manifestly unjust - it’s time for discretion, common sense and compassion to be reintroduced to our system.Mr Ineomo-Marcus’s wife Stacey,\u0026nbspwho has had to take time off work since Monday in order to care for her children in her husband\u0027s absence, said the situation was “extremely draining”.The 31-year-old continued: “The kids are coming home and looking for daddy’s shoes. I say daddy’s going to come back. He’s just gone to do something. No one seems to care that he has children he needs to look after.“It’s as though the government wants me to be a single parent and on benefits. I won’t be able to cope if he goes. I won’t be able to work. He does everything with the children – takes them to the library, does activates with them.“He has worked all his life and he’s made one mistake. They’ve punished him for it once and they’re punishing him again. British-born people who have done much worse than him are able to live their life with their family after they’ve done their time.He has no home in Nigeria – where do they expect him to go?”Speaking about the prospect of his removal, Mr Ineomo-Marcus said he feared for the future of his children being\u0026nbspleft in a fatherless household.“They are used to waking up in the morning. I take them swimming every Saturday. I pick the eldest up from school and they’re with me until mummy gets home. I put them to bed,” he said.“My wife is going to have to stop working because it would be impossible to make any alternative childcare arrangements. Why should she have to do this when I am well and alive?\u0026nbsp“There’s a massive crisis in our society right now where young boys are stabbing each other. A lot of them are young black boys from disadvantaged backgrounds. And when I’ve had conversations with young offenders in prisons there is a common theme and that is an absence of a father figure in their lives.\u0026nbsp“That is worrying for me, because these boys are potentially my sons. That scares me.”The Home Office said they did not comment on inidual cases, but said: Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.Asylum and ImmigrationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

MasochismMay faces growing Tory and DUP backlash over Brexit dealAnd then I think some of those other alternatives will need to come into play.The final part of the draft agreement was agreed by negotiators in Brussels and London, setting out the political agreement for the future relationship with the EU.Senior Tories lined up to rubbish the plans during a tensee Commons statement on Wednesday, where the\u0026nbspprime minister told MPs that a good Brexit deal was within our grasp.Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson described the plan\u0026nbspas complete nonsense and Iain Duncan-Smith, former Tory leader, said it was not at all workable in its current form.However education secretary Damian Hinds defended the plan, telling the Today programme that support would grow in parliament as MPs considered the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal.The deal that we have on the table is a strong deal. It is a good, balanced deal. As people reflect on what the alternatives are, I think people are going to come to see this is a very good deal for Britain, he said.Ahead of the summit, Spanish prime minister\u0026nbspPedro Sanchez threatened to veto Brexit over the issue of Gibraltar, the disputed British territory.Spain says the future relationship to be negotiated between the EU and UK should not apply to Gibraltar and that it should be only decided bilaterally between itself and Britain.But Theresa May has rejected this idea and has said the plan must apply to “the whole United Kingdom family” – a group which apparently includes the British Overseas Territory.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That will be made harder by her seeming so reluctant to endorse it over\u0026nbspthe status quo.One caller asks how much sleep the prime minister gets and whether she falls asleep dreaming of Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMay says she doesn\u0027t, but that she usually doesn\u0027t get to bed until after midnight.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEmma Barnett finishes by asking May how she will celebrate with her husband, Philip, if her deal is approved.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll have a drink, she replies.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnd that\u0027s the end of the phone-in.Several callers have said they support May\u0027s Brexit deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnother\u0026nbspasks whether the prime minster thinks her deal is better for the UK than remaining in the EU.\u0026nbspShe doesn\u0027t really answer - again - but says there were parts of EU membership, such as freedom of movement, that caused people concern. During the campaign she supported Remain but said leaving wouldn\u0027t be a disaster, she adds.\u0026nbspThe caller says she hasn\u0027t answered his question.\u0026nbspMay responds: I think we will be better off in a situation where we have control of all those things and are able to trade around\u0026nbspthe rest of the world.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s a different sort of better off she adds...One questioner asks why May is treating the will of the Scottish people\u0026nbspwith such contempt when the region voted to Remain.\u0026nbspShe says we joined the European Union\u0026nbspas the United Kingdom and we will leave the European Union as the United Kingdom.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s right to take the view that came from across the whole of the United Kingdom, she adds.Will May resign if her deal is rejected by MPs, Emma Barnett asks?\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0026nbspsays she is focused on making sure it does get through Parliament.\u0026nbspWhen pushed, she says\u0026nbspthis isn\u0027t about me. Pushed further, she says only that she isn\u0027t thinking about herself and is only focused on on delivering\u0026nbspher deal.\u0026nbspSo no plans to resign? My focus is on getting this deal through.Brendan in Hartlepool calls in to ask Theresa May about the £39bn Brexit orce bill and raises fears that the figure could increase.\u0026nbspThe prime minister claims the government negotiated it down at a time when some people were speculating the ultimate figure could be £100bn.\u0026nbspShe admits that extending the transition period would mean the UK had to pay more, but says there is also the option of the Northern Ireland backstop, which would not require a greater financial contribution.5Live\u0027s Emma Barnett asks Theresa May whether, if her deal is voted down, it will result in no-deal or no Brexit.\u0026nbspMay says if the deal is rejected, the UK will be back at square one and the\u0026nbspEU will not offer a better deal.\u0026nbspRejection of her plan would cause more ision and more uncertainty, she says, adding that there are MPs who will argue for no-deal and others who want to frustrate Brexit. She says she wants to deliver Brexit and that all her focus will be on getting the vote through.\u0026nbspShe repeatedly refuses to be drawn on what her Plan B is if MPs reject her proposal.\u0026nbspThe first caller asks if May thinks she will get her deal through Parliament.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister says her job is to persuade people. She says MPs need to remember that people\u0027s jobs, education and communities must be at the forefront of their mind when they decide how to vote on the proposed agreement.We\u0027re expecting the 5Live phone-in with Theresa May to begin imminently.

She can’t convince her party,\u0026nbspand even the CBI\u0026nbsphave privately\u0026nbsppanned her deal.“Dutifully they have trotted out their line on Monday but these emails show they don’t believe it by Thursday. Of course any deal is better than no deal, but both are bad deals.”Mr Raab, who quit the cabinet last week in protest at the Brexit deal, said the PM’s withdrawal proposals were worse than staying in the EU.“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU,” he told\u0026nbspBBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continuesPrime Minister Theresa May speaking at the CBI annual conference at InterContinental Hotel.

attended\u0026nbspthe Exposition Universelle in Paris, where he demonstrated his device by recording the voice of Austrian emperor Franz Josef - our earliest surviving magnetic recording - taking home the Grand Prix for his trouble.He followed this breakthrough with the invention of the first continuous wave transmitter in 1903, dubbed the Poulsen\u0026nbspArc, which would be used in the earliest

The plan stated: “We will improve the credit blacklist system, publicly disclose the records of enterprises and iniduals’ untrustworthiness on a regular basis, and form a pattern of distrust and punishment.”Car ploughs into crowd outside primary school in China, killing fiveTrump aide says China could be evicted from WTO as trade war ramps upGovernment spending foreign aid money to promote fracking in ChinaFor those deemed untrustworthy, “everywhere is limited, and it is difficult to move, so that those who violate the law and lose the trust will pay a heavy price”.The credit system is already being rolled out in some areas and in recent months the Chinese state has blocked millions of people from booking flights and high-speed trains.According to the state-run news outlet Global Times, as of May this year, the government had\u0026nbspblocked 11.14 million people from flights and 4.25 million from taking high-speed train trips.The state has also begun to clamp down on luxury options: 3\u0026nbspmillion people are barred from getting business class train tickets, according to Channel News Asia.China tell ambassadors not to ‘interfere’ on Muslim re-education campsThe aim, according to Hou Yunchun, former deputy director of the development research centre of the State Council, is to make “discredited people become bankrupt”, he said earlier this year. The eastern state of Hangzou, southwest of Shanghai, is one area where a social credit system is already in place. People are awarded credit points for activities such as undertaking volunteer work and giving blood donations while those who violate traffic laws and charge “under-the-table” fees are punished. Other infractions reportedly include\u0026nbspsmoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games and posting fake news online.Punishments are not clearly detailed in the government plan, but beyond making travel difficult, are also believed to include slowing internet speeds, reducing access to good schools for iniduals or their children, banning people from certain jobs, preventing booking at certain hotels and losing the right to own pets.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lebanese army soldiers march during a parade to mark the 75th anniversary of Lebanon\u0027s Independence Day, in Beirut, commemorating the liberation from the French Mandate on 22 November 1943Indian Muslim devotees wave flags as they parade atop vehicles along a street during Eid-Milad-Un-Nabi celebrations in Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar PradeshAt least 50 people were killed and dozens more injured when a suicide bomber targeted a group of Muslim religious scholars in Kabul, officials in Afghanistan say.A view of the Fuego volcano eruption at sunrise, seen from El Rodeo, Escuintla, Guatemala.

It delivers on the vote of the referendum. It brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws.And it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.She added: The British people want this to be settled. They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future. That deal is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver it.Empty House of Commons during the draft Brexit statement given by Theresa May (Image: Universal News And Sport (Europe))The political declaration - designed to form the basis of a new trade deal to be thrashed out after Britain quits the EU next year - promised an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership between Britain and the bloc.It said trade will be underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition while respecting the integrity of the Union\u0027s single market and customs union as well as the UK\u0027s internal market while confirming EU free movement for migrants to travel to the UK would end.The deal was signed off by the Cabinet in a hastily arranged conference call yesterday.A Downing Street source said: There was strong support for the declaration that has been negotiated. The Cabinet agreed it overall and on specific areas of ministerial responsibility.Dominic Raab, resigned as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union  (Image: Dan KitwoodGetty Images)Mrs May was given strong public backing from Home Secretary Sajid Javid last night. In an interview in Westminster\u0027s The House magazine, he said: \u0026ldquoI think that the draft agreement the Prime Minister has reached with our EU friends delivers on the referendum.The country made a clear decision, it delivered instructions to the politicians and we have to obey those instructions.\u0026ldquoWhat the Prime Minister has worked on is a deal that I believe delivers on that. It gives us back control of our laws, of our money and our borders.Reporting her deal to the Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs: The British people want Brexit to be settled they want a good deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future and they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.Britain is to quit the EU next year (Image: Chris RatcliffeBloomberg Getty Images)The deal that will enable us to do this is now within our grasp.In these crucial 72 hours ahead, I will do everything possible to deliver it for the British people.But in another gruelling question-and-answer session at the Commons dispatch box, the Prime Minister weathered a series of attacks from Tory heavyweights about the so-called Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Johnson, the former foreign secretary, told her the plan made a complete nonsense of Brexit.He said:\u0026nbsp We should junk forthwith the backstop, upon which the future economic partnership - according to this political declaration - is to be based, and which makes a complete nonsense of Brexit.Theresa May and EU Council President Donald Tusk in Brussels (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab warned the deal would do the opposite of giving the country back control.The backstop ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice and an EU veto over our exit whilst paragraph 23 of the political declaration makes that the starting point for future relations to build on.The top reason people voted to leave the EU was to take back control over our laws. Isn\u0027t it the regrettable but inescapable reality that this deal gives even more away?Former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers said: The withdrawal agreement locks us in to paying the \u0026pound38 billion and also commits us to a backstop which has us obeying their rules and applying their customs rules without any say over them.                What is the withdrawal agreement? What is the political declaration?                Brexiteer leaves radio host speechless as he SHOUTS against May\u0027s dealIn her statement, the Prime Minister confirmed she had won concessions from the EU that will encourage high-tech customs checks to be used to try to prevent the need for a hard border as an alternative to the backstop.She acknowledged that Mr Duncan Smith and former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson had helped with ideas about the plan.But both former ministers told the Commons they could still not back the plan in its current form.Mr Duncan Smith urged her to strip out the backstop while Mr Paterson said the measure threatened the horror of Northern Ireland being split off.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, chief whip of Mrs May\u0027s parliamentary allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, called on the Prime Minister to dump the backstop and come forward with the alternatives set out in the political declaration instead.He said: If she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement then we need to see an end to the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place.Pro-Brussels Tories also attacked the deal, with some calling for a fresh referendum.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle.Theresa Villiers, former Northern Ireland Secretary (Image: Simon DawsonBloomberg via Getty Images)He said: The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with a backstop and no exit.It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.Tory whips were beginning the challenging task of trying to win over sceptical backbenchers last night.A senior Tory source said: We will be seeking to persuade all of our colleagues on the Conservative benches that this is a good deal for the country that delivers on the referendumLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn condemned the political declaration as 26 pages of waffle (Image: Jason AldenBloomberg via Getty Images)It takes back control of borders, money and laws and does that while protecting jobs and security.Tory Brexiteer MPs gave the Prime Minister an early taste of the opposition within her party to the deal within an hour of its publication.Senior Tory backbencher Sheryll Murray said: \u0026ldquoIn the EU referendum people voted to taken back control of our fish. Yet now the Prime Minister wants to commit us to stay in the Common Fisheries Policy in all but name.She seeks to enter a new fisheries agreement on access to waters and quota shares. Let\u0026rsquos be clear. This is a betrayal of Brexit.The Brexit draft (Image: Thierry MonasseGetty Images)Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel said: \u0026ldquoEverything the EU wanted from the negotiations has ended up in the Withdrawal Agreement \u0026ndash which is a legally enforceable international treaty.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why we\u0026rsquore going to stay in the EU customs union, remain subject to judgments of the European Court, imperil our Union and allow the EU to have a veto over when we can leave the backstop.\u0026ldquoEverything the UK wanted has been put in an unenforceable, meaningless declaration.\u0026nbsp And it\u0026rsquos cost us \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoThis is a costly surrender by the UK Government.Scottish Secretary David Mundell (Image: Jack TaylorGetty Images)Simon Clarke, another Eurosceptic Tory backbencher, said: \u0026ldquoThe political declaration is a well-meaning but ultimately meaningless set of words.\u0026ldquoAll the perils of the Withdrawal Agreement would bind the UK with the force of an international treaty.\u0026nbsp It will lock us into the EU customs union, subject us to the European Court\u0026rsquos judgments, threaten our union, give the EU the power to say when we can leave the backstop and cost the UK \u0026pound39billion.\u0026ldquoAnd anything we wanted from the negotiations has been trumpeted in a political declaration which has absolutely no legal effect on anyone.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThis is a declaration of surrender by the UK Government.PM Theresa May declares that her Brexit deal is  (Image: Getty)Ranil Jayawardena, who quit as a ministerial aide last week in protest at the deal, said: \u0026ldquoThis isn\u0027t a settlement it\u0027s a surrender.\u0026ldquoInstead of taking back control, we will be abandoning control over vast swathes of our social and economic policy - and we will be simply unable to agree the trade deals of tomorrow with the rest of the world.This \u0027deal\u0027 stops us seizing the benefits of Brexit, whilst shackling us to the worst parts of the EU.\u0026ldquoThis is not a good and fair Brexit. It is not fair to the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in 2016, and isn\u0027t good enough for many who voted to remain either. A deal that delivers on the referendum is possible, and this isn\u0027t it.Former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith (Image: Anthony DevlinGetty Images)And Mrs May was facing an angry backlash over the future for Britain\u0027s territorial fishing waters.Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson branded the political declaration unacceptable, as he said the UK must be a normal independent coastal state like Norway.He tweeted the political declaration commits UK to establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares and added: This means sovereignty over our waters sacrificed for a trade deal.Tory Cabinet minister and Brexiteer Boris Johnson (Image: Steve BackGetty Images)But Scottish Secretary David Mundell insisted the political declaration was a good deal for the fishing industry, which would allow the UK to become an independent coastal state and leave the hated CFP.Speaking during a visit to an Edinburgh school, he said Britain would be able to negotiate its own agreement on access and quotas with the EU just as Iceland and Norway do at the moment.The minister added: There will be no pre-existing arrangements in the political declaration.Quotas and access will be discussed but there will be no predetermined arrangements as to what those quotas and access will be. It will be decided annually.

In any case, further negotiations would only be possible if other European countries were also prepared to continue.A late \u0026ldquono vote could also be followed by further negotiations, but only if the two-year window dictated by Article 50 is extended.That can only happen with the unanimous agreement of the other member states.

The cost of shooting a slightly smaller red stag falls incrementally from \u0026pound18,500 down to \u0026pound3,500.Two men are charging astonishingly high fees for the pleasure of killing England\u0027s finest red stags (Image: Tim Clarke)The organisation behind the shoots is a professional outfit, packaged to suit wealthy Americans who enjoy the canned hunting experience so despised by animal lovers. At the heart of the operation is Aaron Bulkley, a 41-year-old father of one, and Englishman Alex Hinkins, a well-known stalker in the hunting world.After studying at the University of Texas Business School, Bulkley worked as a sales agent for a ticket agency while perfecting his computer graphics skills. He was so good at organising ticket sales he travelled the world, selling tickets to blue-chip events such as the FIFA World Cup and the Rugby World Cup.Alex Hinkins posing with a \u0027trophy\u0027 (Image: Wings_hunting_shooting INSTAGRAM)A passionate hunter, he later set up the Texas Hunt Lodge, which offers hunts for 60 species of exotic wildlife.Now he has set up Europehunts, which he owns, but works with Alex Hinkins, who litters social media with shots of himself and other hunters with the bodies of recently despatched animals.On the website now is a picture of a man holding the horns of a huge deer. A rifle with a telescopic site is placed over the neck of the deer - proudly.BIG BUCKS: Aaron Bulkley (Image: Europe Hunts)The caption reads: New World Record Red Stag in England. On our November group hunt from Texas Aaron Bulkley and guests hunted for five days both in Woburn and Norfolk. It was in Norfolk they put down some monster fallow deer.The record red stag was also killed in Norfolk, the website says.Woburn Abbey was quick to distance itself from any suggestion the hunters used their land, saying : It is highly likely that this party was hunting in the Woburn area with no connection to the Bedford Estates.Chinese water deer and muntjac have established populations in the wild, they added.Alex Hinkins litters social media with shots of himself with bodies of recently despatched animals (Image: Wings_hunting_shooting\u0026#8232 INSTAGRAM)In the slick video Bulkley boasts that he has been awarded guide of the year and outfitter of the year titles many times and has hunted more than 150 world-class species in the past eight years. He also explains why he is now targeting this country as a hunting location.Warming to this theme, he says: At Europehunts we are hunting all over England. We\u0027ve got accommodation to fit anyone\u0027s desired needs, everything from a 17th-century inn, which might be two or three star, all the way up to four star or maybe even a castle, depending on your group.What we have in England are some species you can\u0027t hunt anywhere else in the wild or estate. We have some of the largest red stag, the world-record Chinese water deer, the muntjac. This is a destination for all hunters to fulfil some of their European slams.                National Trust probed as land being used for \u0026lsquoillegal deer hunts\u0026rsquo                Death threats to TV hunter on killing spreeOn his partnership with with Alex Hinkins, he says: He\u0027s been hunting all of his life in England. He\u0027s been rated as one of the top-rated stalkers in the country.Hinkins tells the hunting community watching the video: Our hunting varies in England. We will do spot and stalk. We will do a hike. Depending on what estate we hunt we will be hunting in redwood forest or in the oak forest. They can be challenging compared to some of the destinations around the world. Typical Bedforshire is rolling hill countryside, nothing too crazy. If we push on up to Norfolk it is a very flat county. It is very easy going for the hunter.In America\u0027s hunting world, there is a craze to go back to the old days when metal balls were put down muzzles and then fired with gunpowder.Another company is offering hunting packages in the deer park at Woburn Abbey (Image: Andrew Rolfe  Alamy Stock Photo)Now Hinkins is offering a modern version of the same method in England. In a matter-of-fact, homely style he says in the video: We tend to be a rifle hunting country but recently we\u0027ve introduced the muzzle-loader.I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunity to be the only agent in England who can offer muzzleloader hunts and that\u0027s already paying off, with records already being set.Then the camera pans to a group of hunters eating a feast of the animal they have just shot. Hinkins sells the moment with this commentary: One of the pleasing things to me is proving to you guys that England actually does know how to cook. We have fantastic meals with all of our clients.As well as red stags, Chinese water deer and muntjacs, fallow and sika, he also offers hunts for roebucks in the summer months and particular types of rams with magnificent horns. At one stage in the video Hinkins adds: We\u0027ve got amazing red stags that we offer here, wild and estate parked.Hunting grounds in England range from centuries-old estates hunted by royalty even today, to private English forests. Fees for shooting a muntjac are \u0026pound1,150, a Chinese water deer costs more at \u0026pound1,850 and a soay ram will set back a hunter \u0026pound1,250.Last month it was revealed that another company was offering hunting packages at the 3,000-acre Woburn Abbey Deer Park.Alex Hinkins and unknown man with Red Stag (Image: Wings_hunting_shooting INSTAGRAM)Woburn said in response it was not affiliated to the travel company. But it said in a statement: One of the most important management aspects of the deer park is the annual cull. The cull is overseen by professionals to ensure a healthy and sustainable population within the park.The cull is based on continued census counts and aims to improve age dynamics and ersity, maintaining the population density at a level suitable to ensure the continued health and welfare of the deer within the park.There are pockets of private land near the park owned by other people in which hunting also takes place.Europehunts\u0027s brazen selling has shocked and appalled animal lovers and anti-hunting groups.Chris Luffingham, director of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, says: It is sickening to know that trophy hunting is taking place here in the heart of the UK and that Woburn is profiting from this vile activity.Killing animals and posing with the corpses of the victims is repulsive and has no place in a modern and compassionate society.We are a nation of animal-lovers and people will be outraged that hunters are coming in from overseas and shooting them for fun.Alex Hinkins with Hog Deer (Image: Wings_hunting_shooting INSTAGRAM)The pressure group Bedfordshire Against Trophy Hunting (BATH) started a petition to try to get the hunting stopped.A spokesman says: This is a disgrace and should be investigated by Parliament. It is utterly wrong that international hunters are coming here to kill stags. It has become an industry, with lucrative sums being paid for trophy stags.Comments written under BATH\u0027s petition give an indication of the outrage felt by people. Sue Armitage wrote: If animals require culling because there are no natural predators then let this be done professionally quietly and with respect. DO NOT turn this into a sick moneymaking scheme allowing people with a desire to kill for pleasure, which is a psychological mental illness.Wayne Law added: It is barbaric to shoot such majestic animals.The  has sought comment from Aaron Bulkley and Alex Hinkins, but neither made contact.

Preferably driving John Barrowman’s jeep.But definitely presenting I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! which kicked off, on Sunday night, with Dec hosting and Holly ­Willoughby hanging around like a competition winner.An arrangement that would be unsustainable in other years. I’m prepared to cut the  series some slack, though, for two reasons.First, it is purely a temporary pairing and, second, ITV has promised me Noel Edmonds, who shouldn’t just have been the first one in the camp, he should’ve been choppered in about eight years ago, when the contestants started all this “bonding” rubbish, which has ruined more series than I care to remember.Oh, what some of them could’ve done with a one-man feud generator like Noel, whose Wikipedia entry will give you a fair idea of his inner turmoil even before you get to the bit where he says: “When I die, my energy willto where it came from.” Ilford He’s also got a le-size mannequin doll called Candice, who accompanies him everywhere and would be a more than welcome replacement for a few of the camp mates, who’ve got a bit of a Rita Who and Knob Too feel about them this year.The knob part of that equation, fairly obviously, is all-singing, all-dancing John Barrowman “MBE” , who described himself as “fabulous”, “an icon” and “down-to-earth” within the space of one sentence, on Sunday, and was wrong on every count.He also hit on the yacht waiter, using one of his dance moves.“It’s a pas de bourrée. Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show. Paddy Considine, Jessica Raines and Bel Powley all performing brilliantly in BBC’s Informer.Channel ’s strangely addictive and reassuring live operations series, with Nicky Campbell.Prime-Minister-in-waiting Johnny Mercer MP breezing through Celebrity Hunted, without dear old Kay Burley to encumber him.Scotland playing olé football against the mighty Albania.And the politically incorrect brilliance of the response Chase contestant Bethan gave to Bradley Walsh’s question: “The name of what German ­company comes from the name of founder Adolf Dassler ”“Hitler.”Compiled by Graham WrayGary Neville: “Lingard has his hands in his head.”Michael Dawson: “It’s an unexpected start for Spurs because they didn’t expect that.”Trevor Bayliss: “We’ve come to Sri Lanka to play in conditions which are foreign to us.”And Paul Merson: “A poor finish from Vardy, but that’s him at his best.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Like .million others, I voted for Brexit on the basis thatthe EU wouldn’t give us a mutually beneficial deal then we would simply leave without one.It’s now clear that, despite the clear mandate from . per cent of the British people that they want out, the painful preication of Mrs May’s “negotiations”has told the Brussels Eurocrats that our government is wavering on that mindset and, consequently, they feel they have us over an imported barrel.So it’s time to show them that they don’t — by openly preparing for no deal. After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

Or, in John Sergeant and Ann Widdecombe’s case, common moths in freefall after a battering from a tea towel.But former Pussycat Doll Ashley is used to performing complicated dance routines in front of huge crowds and, therefore, oozed confidence and expertise from the get go.Little wonder since, according to her former dance teacher in the US, she was taught “all dferent styles of dance” from the age of eight to  and once had an introduction to ballroom training by an elite dance company at summer school.So yes, she’s undoubtedly the best, with former Steps trouper Faye Tozer not far behind. But the true Strictly stars are all the others who improve each week despite being way outside their comfort zone.FOLLOWING the shocking attack of a female PC being karate-kicked to the ground by a thug, the flippant commentary accompanying the footage is indeed sickening.But at least the film might help secure a prosecution and hopefully prove a turning point in how we take back control of our lawless streets.Because the real problem here is the fact that thugs clearly don’t fear the consequences of their actions.So may I humbly suggest that it’s high time the Home Office toughens up and shows, not tells, our hard-pressed police that they now have the power and support they need from on high to do their job effectively.CHECK out poo guru Gillian McKeith out on the town with her smiling -year-old daughter Skylar.Considering my daughters won’t be seen dead with meI wear anything more risqué than a baggy polo neck and tweed maxi skirt, she’s very fortunate indeed.THE £.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We mean having literally no money and going hungry.So it is good to see Amber Rudd, in her first week as Work and Pensions Secretary, consider slashing the five-week wait many claimants endure before their Universal Credit comes through.We support the new benefits system.

Ive been waiting for  years. Some birthdays Id cry because she wasnt there.Isaiah is one of an estimated , children who are given up for adoption every year in the US.Increasingly, open adoption is becoming more popular: a business worth billions of dollars where those looking to adopt pay up to £, for a newborn via agencies that match kids to prospective parents.In the final episode of his new series Altered States, Louis Theroux travels to Southern Calornia to find out more about the practice - discovering that while it helps create new, loving families it is also at risk of exploitation - as birth mothers can change their minds but adopters wont be refunded.According to Irene Riley - who runs the adoption agency Rainbow’s End Adoption Services in LA -many women give up their kids due to problems with drink and drugs or running into financial dficulty.Isaiahs mum Trina struggled with a crystal meth addiction for many years.Then when she was heavily pregnant with her son, her partner beat her up and left her for dead.I prayed to God and saidyou save me and the baby I promise Ill do whats right for him, she says.Now clean and living a good le, Trina is incredibly grateful to Isaiahs adoptive mum Joanne for including her in his sons le.“I told you when you was in my tummy I loved you but I was giving you the chance to have a better le, with good people. I always wanted you to be OK,” she tells Isaiah.Louis says this positive reunion seems a tribute to open adoption.However, theres not always a happy ending with open adoption, as Louis discovers when he meets Patricia, a pregnant former nurse who is living hand to mouth in motels after falling on hard times.Like Trina, she has also struggled with drug addiction and had numerous run-ins with the law -something Louis expresses concern over.Patricia already has three kids of her own, but says now she simply cant afford to have a fourth. I never saw myself in this position, she says. But my little girl will be able to have a much better le this way.She is matched with a couple, Ari and Amy, who already have three boys but desperately want a girl to complete their brood.As part of the process, Ari and Amy agree to pay Patricia £,a month living expenses.However, she starts to go AWOL, not updating the couple or Irene on her progress and only briefly turning up whenever she needs to collect money - cash Louis worries is going on drugs.Under Calornia law, a woman has  days to change her mind about putting her baby up for adoption.This loophole means the practice of open adoption comes with risk: parents dont get a refund for any money theyve already put in, meaning they can lose thousands of pounds, and there is a lack of regulation.There have been a number of scams in the US. In  a Kansas woman, Roxanne Jones, conned ten couples out of money by ly claiming she was pregnant.In April this year a Louisiana woman, Betty Jo Krenz was jailed after running an agency that produced fake adoption papers.And in November  Shareen Gurnsey, from Alabama, was charged with theft by deception after taking money from one couple while promising her unborn child to three others, matching with them through separate adoption agencies.And it appears Ari and Amy have fallen victim to a scam by Patricia, who becomes increasingly elusive as her due date looms.Eventually, Irene makes contact with her, finding out that Patricia gave birth to her baby in a motel by herself and now wants to keep the child, leaving Ari and Amy, who have already decorated a nursery, devastated.Amy tells Louis that Irene had received a message from Patricia telling them to leave me alone so I can enjoy my new baby you guys are ruining this for me.For those like Isaiah, theres happy endings.However, Louis concludes by saying there is an inbuilt tension in open adoption between the needs of the often vulnerable birth mum and the ever hopeful adopters.It is a process open to abuse and however it happens, pain is intrinsic to it.Louis Theroux Altered States: Take My Baby airs on BBC Two at pm on Sunday  NovemberOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stay away from Jarlath, bitch. I’m going to f******g kill you.”On another she said “You don’t see him, you don’t date him and don’t f**k him. I’ll kill myself.

She was convicted after a trial at Brighton Magistrates Court.In a victim impact statement Mr Rice said the campaign of stalking left him on the brink of suicide and had been in “despair”.He said: “For over  years I’ve had to live with verbal, mental and physical abuse.“The aggressive and abusive dismantling of my le has left me vulnerable, frightened and exhausted.”Mr Rice said he had been “pushed deep into depression” adding: “At my worst I have gone through periods of despair with suicide ideation.”In her defence, Tantash said she came from a stable, upper middle class family but was suffering from a mental condition.She claimed to have paid Mr Rice’s sizeable debts and supported his career infor a romantic commitment.Miss Bolland said: “It’s a strange and terrible experience when someone psychologically harasses you like this.“It’s an awful feeling. It’s astonishing how much it can impact your le, your mood, your thoughts.”Teresa Mulrooney, defending, said: “Miss Tantash deeply regrets her behaviour and has come to understand the impact it has had.”Sentencing her, Recorder Stephen Lennard, said: “You were never prepared to accept it was over and thereafter carried out a sustained and vicious campaign of stalking and harassment that lasted  years.“In my opinion you are vicious, devious and manipulative woman.

They have both failed to protect our children.Mr Newby kept his daughters away from the school after finding out about the pupil and only let themwhen he was certain the man was not going back.Sandy Martin, the Labour MP for Ipswich, said the Home Office “need to get their act together” to ensure adults cannot pose as children in the classroom.He said: “The Home Office needs to make sure that they are not sending people who are overage to school.“They have the means to do this and they need to do it. It doesn’t help the young people involved any more than it helps the schools.“I think the fact that it has had such a high profile in the news has made sure that the Home Office will do their job a bit better in the future, although the history of the Home Office doing its job a bit better isn’t very encouraging.”The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was “posing as a pupil” in her class.He said: “They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take,“I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.“The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies.“I explained that I was sorrythe pupil turned out to be a genuine -year-old, but that parents had a responsibility for the safeguarding of children in their care, as should the school.“The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.“He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, “You have not heard the last about this”.Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of another -year-old boyIt was also claimed that the pupil bombarded a -year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff – because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing “sinister” about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at dferent ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged  and was married with two children when he was askedhe wanted to join in a game of football at break time.A Home Office spokesperson said: “When there is doubt about an inidual’s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority’s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.“If an inidual is assessed to be over , we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.“In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adulttheir physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are signicantly over  years of age – and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.“The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over  are assessed as adults.”The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were “not attending the school” and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case.The school has not made any new statement and Suffolk County Council has also not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451333393.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"scrooge school christmas commercial","story":"Pupils at Lady Lumley’s School in Pickering, North Yorks., were told they must write to their RE teacher to plead for the celebration to be brought back.In an assembly this week, Father Christmas told students about the true meaning of Christmas being “lost and buried under an avalanche of commercialisation” before announcing the holiday was cancelled.Cards, gts and Christmas activities were banned unless persuasive arguments can be made to argue the real meaning of Christmas, he said.Children at the secondary school now have until November  to email their Religious Education teacher to persuade her the school should celebrate Christmas.Headteacher Richard Bramley said: “In assemblies this week, Mrs Paul, one of our teachers of RE, spoke about Christmas and whether the message of Christmas has been lost and buried under an avalanche of commercialisation.“Christmas is a day celebrating the birth of Jesus and should be a time of goodwill to all, yet it can be a very stressful, expensive, argumentative and lonely time.“Mrs Paul read out a letter from Father Christmas and cited the example of Christmas cards which bear no relation to the origin or meaning of Christmas but carry symbols we now recognise as associated with the holiday season, e.g Santa Claus who, in his modern incarnation, was probably invented by the Coca Cola company!The reception has been mixed among parents and students with the ban being taken badly by some.One parent tweeted: “I understand the way the RE teacher is trying to educate the kids.

which they called Angle-land - from around AD to , after the Romans soldiers left in .As well as being craftsmen and farmers, the Anglo-Saxons were also fierce warriors and would fight to the death to defend their territory.The Anglo-Saxons ruled Britain from  years when they were conquered by the Normans, who invaded from Northern France.The helmets were transformed using cutting-edge technology and ancient craft techniques and will go on display with other items found in the  hoard.A spokeswoman from Birmingham Museums Trust said substantial remains of just five other Anglo-Saxon helmets exist, along with fragments of a handful more -

But as in all animal farming, there will be the rare occasion when sicknesses or wounds etc. can occur.“Although responsible fur farmers are doing their best, it is possible that some of the thousands of production animals can suddenly fall ill. Four dead animals out of the , animals on the mink farm on the date of the secret filming equals .% mortality, which is below the typical figures in the production animal sector.”The statement claimed both farms involved had valid Finnish Standards certication and both farms have been inspected according to this certication programme.British MPs debated a ban on fur imports in Parliament in June after a petition garnered , signatures.In the end the government dismissed the idea, saying “national bans are less effective than working at an international level on animal-welfare standards”.Labour has pledged to ban fur imports and require real fur to be clearly labelled."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000421578862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"vladimir putin power launch nuke strikes plans russian parliament","story":"Senators have recommended tearing up the military doctrine banning initial use of weapons of mass destruction.It comes after the Russian president said Moscow would retaliatethe US withdrew from a landmark cold War missile treaty.Currently the doctrine prohibits first use unless Russia is threatened by weapons of mass destruction orits very existence is in jeopardy.But the revision would give Putin power to order strikes in response to enemy use of conventional weapons, reports The Times.Senators in the Federation Council propose that Russia should be allowed to hit back with nuke weaponsthe country is attacked by hypersonic and non-nuclear strategic weapons.The move comes after Donald Trump announced that the US plans to withdraw from Intermediate-Range Nuclear ForcesTreaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in .Russia and America have accused each other of violating the deal, with the matter expected to be discussed by Trump and Putin at a G meeting in Argentina.The Kremlin warned that the US decision would make the world “a more dangerous place”.The Times reported that Franz Klintsevich, a member of the council’s defence committee, said that eastern European countries hosting Nato military bases, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, “should understand that we won’t simply look at that through our fingers — we will react”.Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the council’s foreign committee, said that the US intention to withdraw from the treaty could lead to Russia deploying missiles banned by the pact “on the territories of our allies”.The move comes after the Pentagon updated its own nuclear policies by broadening the circumstances under which it would carry out nuclear strikes.Only last month, Putin told an international policy forum that Russia would only use its nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack on the country.He told the Valdai Club: “Our strategy of nuclear weapons use doesn’t envision a preemptive strike.Our concept is a launch under attack.

Love is a Gt has now hit the million view mark.All the feels around the nation! Thanks to everyone who is sharing out short film.A special film with a special message.Congratulations Phil Beastall on this achievement - this didnt happen by chance or sheer luck - this happened because you are a talented filmmaker and a wonderful storyteller.Good work deserves to be seen - you deserve this.And she added last night: Our no budget film seems to be receiving all the love and stealing some thunder!The nation has been left weeping this week after the film, shot in , resurfaced and reminded people of the true message of Christmas.Chris, who has since gone on to co-found COBA Digital, posted today: A short film I was a part of  years ago seems to have gained huge traction in the past hrs, created by the talented Phil Beastall - and although I’m pleased to say my appearance has changed for the better - the message is still as relevant now as it was then.Since the emotional tale went viral, Phil has been inundated with messages from fans who claim the video could have been used instead of the expensive Elton John-themed John Lewis advert.Others have suggested the store hire him to make their Christmas ad for .Among those welling up after viewing the ad was Good Morning Britain host Ben Shephard who admitted on todays show he couldnt watch it without crying.The young filmmaker told the show he got the moving idea for the film while on a run.He said: To be honest, it was just a last minute decision really. Im a bit of a kind of frustrated film maker and I wanted to get a Christmas film out there.It was just when I was on a run on a Sunday and I just came up with this idea and I just really wanted to create something that would resonate with people as I thought especially in todays society we kind of just need that reminder that we are not really defined by our careers and materialism, actually family does come first.So ultimately I just wanted to create something that was emotive and what resonated with people and maybe they would turn to their wives, husbands, kids whatever and give them a cuddle and say I love you.Phil, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said he was a fan of the John Lewis ad, but added: “People seem to like my film because it’s the story that shines through. You don’t always need a huge budget, just an impactful narrative that gets the message across.”Thousands of commentators praised the video online and admitted that it had reduced them to tears.Melanie Thomas wrote: In tears. I have no words except John Lewis, tell your advertising team they [are] sacked. “Stop plugging Elton Johns song and get this man to do your adverts.Lisa Darling said: Best advert ever, maybe John Lewis should pay him a million.The response was so overwhelming that Phil conceded defeat in trying to respond to all the comments because the video attracted so much attention.Most touchingly, Phil received messages of thanks from parents who have lost a child and also children whose parents are no longer alive because the video had a positive impact on them.Phil said: “A lot of people are saying how it has touched them and made them feel that they can cope a little bit more this Christmas, which is amazing.“I never expected that at all.

Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “The last thing we want is for Britain to be tied beyond .“The British people want us to get out. This is a sell-out.”Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: “This is £billion for a pig in a poke.“The EU’s got nailed down everything it wants whilst leaving us on a half promise of what we want.”And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it “ pages of waffle”.He said: “The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with backstop and no exit.“It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.”He accused the PM of producing a “blindfold Brexit from a government that spent more time negotiating with itself than for the nation”.In yesterday’s document, the EU agreed the UK can end free movement, try to negotiate deals with the rest of the world and take back control of fisheries.But the EU refused to accept that a future EU-UK trade deal will allow Mrs May “frictionless trade” and insisted the UK will be bound by EU rules on everything from state aid to climate change.And it only accepted that technology would be “considered” as a way of preventing theof a hard border in Irelanda future trade deal is not agreed.The terms will almost certainly be formally agreed by Mrs May and  other EU leaders at a crunch summit in Brussels on Sunday. This will trigger the orce bill of up to £billion.In a fierce Commons exchange, the PM resorted to urging MPs to back the deal when it goes before the Commons because the public is bored.She insisted “Brexit is within our grasp” adding: “The British people want Brexit to be settled.“They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future.“And they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.”She once more ruled out the prospect of a second referendum.And Downing Street insisted it will never happen “while she is Prime Minister”.But Brexiteers lined up to slam the agreement — fuelling concerns it will never make it through the Commons in a critical “Meaningful Vote” in three weeks’ time.More than  Tories are thought to be ready to vote down the deal — alongside the DUP, SNP and most Labour MPs.Cabinet ministers spent much of a conference call with Mrs May ­yesterday morning debating how to sell the deal to the nation.Last night Chief Whip Julian Smith emailed Tory MPs urging them to “unite” and back the PM. He told backbenchers: “If we reject this deal we go back to square one.“This would mean damaging uncertainty which will threaten jobs, investment and the economy.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid insisted the deal “delivers on the referendum” — although he admitted the Government must do a “better job of selling” it.But Boris Johnson said the terms of the Brexit deal made a “complete nonsense of Brexit”.And Brexiteers warned they could not support a deal which still included the so-called Irish backstop plan for keeping the border open.But Mrs May insisted it would only kick ina new trade deal isn’t in place by January .But it is still just a woolly and even contradictory wishlist that barely binds Brussels to anything.The cost of these vague promises Some  thousand million pounds.This “political declaration” about the future is predicated on Brussels negotiating a trade deal in good faith, a ­quality they have never shown since the referendum result they are even now desperate to overthrow.Why would their puerile desire to “punish” Britain abate once we nominally leave next March  Especially when under the terms now agreed they can trap us in the Customs Union for ever The PM claims the EU wouldn’t want us there, benefiting from it for free, having ended free movement. But that’s a price Brussels will surely pay to cripple us as a trading rival on their doorstep.That said, the deal is NOT all bad.Downing Street rightly trumpets that it ends free movement and our massive membership subscription, protects jobs and secures our fishing rights .And Mrs May, to her considerable credit, pushed the EU into an extraordinary U-turn over a high-tech solution to police the Irish border. Remember how glibly they once sneered at that idea Trouble is, who trusts them not to change heart againthe appalling “Irish backstop” alternative suits them The trade deal may take years. Anyone could veto it: Spain over Gibraltar. Or the Belgian Walloons who almost wrecked the EU Canada deal. We would be stuck.And while Mrs May’s deal enshrines our right to an independent trade policy, it also says any new partnership with the EU must “build on” a single customs territory. That’s why Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab quit — it ­scuppers any deals where.The one straw we clutch is that Jeremy Corbyn isn’t negotiating. None of his scripted lines, nor his brow furrowed in supposed concentration, can hide that the entire debate sails over his head.Don’t imagine the chaos couldn’t be worseOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the Government had the backing of the Labour Party to pass the ban through Parliament. But  MPs signed an amendment to reverse the ban, including members of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Groupof hard Brexit backbenchers. The group said the ban was disproportionate, and laid out plans for a high-security process for people to obtain high-energy weapons. Yet they were also seeking the chance to prove they had the numbers in Parliament to block government legislation in the run up to the ‘meaningful vote’ on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.  Former Brexit minister Steve Baker, Sir Bill Cash and Sir Bernard Jenkin were among those supporting the amendment to the offensive weapons bill that would prevent a ban on rles that have a power of “over , joules at the muzzle.” It was also opposed by DUP MPs and Labour MP Kate Hoey.

December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in.

The same is true of every party, in every nation, and there is none among us who would be immune to the madness of power were it delivered for a third time.It sends all politicians who have ever managed it into the sort of cocaine-inspired bender Elton John was once famous for - trying to outdo Freddie Mercury with their own sense of misplaced grandeur, while actually being destined for a le in which they look forward to the John Lewis Christmas ad. It happened to Thatcher, it happened to Blair, and now its happening to the entire Conservative Party at once. This time its not a prime ministers career doomed to failure -  years of British politics is circling the plughole, entirely unaware of its looming extinction.   Over Thatchers time in office she burned every friend she had, endeared herself to half the country by presiding over an economic boom, and flushed middle-class goodwill down the toilet with the poll tax. Tory MPs with an eye to their own survival queued up to kne her as their only escape, and combined with the fact shed destroyed the other half of the country along with unions and manufacturing her time was nigh. Blair started out as a nice-sweatered saviour and came to believe he was genuinely touched by God, able to heal wars, depose despots with his righteousness and had no need to plan for the future because he was going to be raptured as soon as hed fixed the Middle East. He even tried to go one better than Jesus by cutting a deal with his personal Judas, and the net result was the whole Labour Party got stuck in the psychodrama and forgot they were supposed to be working for the people.Now we are in our eighth year of the Tories being in control, and theyve gone completely round the bend in half the time it took the others. Lets be kind. Theyve managed a fourth administration on a technicality, been presented with the most complex political problem in British history, and had the backwash of the Great Recession to deal with. But a party operating in the realms of sanity would not have called the fourth election, would not have attempted to settle centuries of squabbling with Europe by flipping a coin, or claimed to be fixing the economy by letting bankers keep their hands on the interestingly-smashy bits.The fact they were going round the twist so early in their reign is the surest sign this is the end game all decisions since  have been touched by madness, with the inevitable result that the Tories now think they really CAN lick their elbow because theyve spent so long claiming to be the only party you can trust with dficult stuff. Every economic, housing, health, justice and education policy did more to reduce than to improve them. This is not a political point but a factual one - the Tories have managed not one single victory, no shining achievement, in almost a decade of control. But there is a near-infinite number of turds. They deported British citizens in the Windrush scandal. They watched  people die in a towering inferno and sent benefit fraudsters to jail quicker than those who caused the deaths. Under their rule , people are thought to have needlessly died. An unprecedented rise in mortality has been linked directly to their policies. The greatest British invention of all time, the National Health Service, is being thoughtlessly destroyed for lack of maintenance. More than a million people are living in destitution and while they crow about near-full employment, millions of those in work rely on charity to feed their families.The Tories, whatever you may think of them, have never been so definitively linked to death and misery. If they had their wits about them, the backbenchers should, about now, be trying to dig their party out of this homicidal mire. Instead theyre declaring every disaster is someone s fault.  Having secured the countrys backing for Brexit, they spent two years arguing with themselves to the detriment of the British economy. Having secured the agreement of the EU on how to Brexit, they want to go back to negotiating it. And despite being called the Conservative and Unionist Party they seem prepared to throw Northern Ireland on the bonfire to appease their most eccentric members.They spent the first year of negotiations demanding Theresa May call an election to secure her mandate, and after she did so spent the second year demanding her head. The million letters of no confidence they cheerfully predicted turned into  they expected by pm, then definitely , then somewhere nearer . They dont even have confidence in their lack of confidence, and their only chance of passing a motion is with internal application of WD-. And while repeatedly calling themselves the party of law and order they let off their own sex pest because he says he was ill, when all sex pests in whatever courts remain open are sent down without mercy.Theyre now a minority government pretending theyre not, killing citizens while claiming to be acting in the national interest, and the only reason this rabid party hasnt been put out of its self-destructive misery is because the Opposition is too busy shooting itself in the foot.

Sophie Dennis says her daughter showed signs of le but claims doctors left her to dieShareCommentsByJames Somper:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsSophie says she put Autumn on her chest for two hours until she was gone \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who lost her baby at just  weeks claims doctors gave up on her daughter and left her to die – because she was born before the abortion limit. Sophie Dennis, , claims little Autumn Orion Dennis showed signs of le and lived for nearly two hours after she was born in October  – before taking her final breaths in her mother’s arms. Sophie claims doctors at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle told her they wouldnt be able to help Autumn because she was born so prematurely, but after the birth she showed signs of le an NHS report revealed ‘were not anticipated’ by doctors. The legal limit of viability – whether or not a baby is deemed to be capable of growing – is  weeks, the abortion limit.  Sophie, from Newcastle, said: “When Autumn was born, I pleaded with doctors to help her. “They said there was nothing they could do because she was  weeks – I think they were expecting her to be born stillborn. “I was in shock so I didn’t protest. They told me how disabled she would be and how she wouldn’t be fit for lethey helped her. “I said ‘are you going to leave my baby to die’ ” “Autumn came out gasping for air, and we kept asking them to do something.  “You could feel her pulse and feel her heartbeat. As she was passed to me she was moving and gasping for air. “She was placed on my chest. I cried as I held her for nearly two hours. “It was instant love but heartbreak at the same time. I felt like I’d failed her and kept apologising to her. I kept saying sorry to her. “Doctors didn’t help her because they were expecting a stillborn. “At the end of the day she was born showing signs of le so she should have been treated as such. “I felt like I wanted to get up and put her in an incubator myself but I also felt helpless. You can’t put it into words how it feels hold your child and watch her die in your arms.  “She was showered with love the whole time she was alive. I would have done anything to swap places with her. “Eventually, a midwe checked on her and said she was gone. “My heart broke and a piece of me left that night and went with her, a piece of me and the person I once was died that night and went with her.” Autumn was born at only  weeks and six days in October  following Sophie’s high risk pregnancy during which she was diagnosed with subchronic haematoma - blood clots in her tissue. An NHS report concluded that Sophie and her husband should have been given the opportunity to talk to a neonatologist regarding the options available and that Autumn was born showing some signs of le, which were not anticipated. NHS advice states that babies born between  and  weeks “may not survive or may have long- term problems” and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologistssay that babies born within this period are a “a major medical and ethical challenge”.  The RCOG say that only after  weeks is there a general agreement that active management should be offered. Sophie also claims doctors made an error on her maternity notes, saying she was  weeks and one day pregnant, which resulted in her daughter not being viewed as ‘viable’. Sophie and husband Sam have now spoken out following the birth of miracle baby son Laken in earlier this year. Sophie said: “I was scared of losing Laken at certain milestones, but thankfully it was a textbook pregnancy “When he was born I didnt want to hold him straight away, I needed a minute because I was full of emotion. “Then something clicked and I scooped him up and held him close to me in the same place where I held Autumn. “I believe she’s always around us and that Autumn looked out for Laken while I was pregnant with him. But despite the joy of a new baby since Autumn’s birth, Sophie says that her baby’s death has devastated her and her family.  Sophie has now launched a petition in an effort to get the guidelines on assisting premature babies revised. She said: “I don’t think any mum should have to go through that level of emotional and physical pain and then be told there’s nothing they could do and watch their child die. “It’s currently a guideline to help a baby born under  weeks eventhey show signs of le. It’s so wrong. If a woman wants to have an abortion she can, buta woman wants her baby to survive they cant. “I knew on that bed, holding my child dying, that I’d do everything I could to stop that happening. “If parents want a child to be helped and the baby is born showing signs of le which Autumn was than they should, because that’s a basic human right. There was so much more that they could have done. I feel hugely let down by the NHS. They let me and my daughter down. I can’t even describe in words how I feel about how they treated us that night. An apology won’t put it right. If she’d have been helped then she would have had a chance at le. “The decision to try and keep my daughter alive was taken away from us and that was heartbreaking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"black friday 2018 uk high","story":"NewsBlack Friday : UK high streets deserted but online tills are ringing in £.bn splurgeEmpty streets in city centres around the UK show that the real action is almost exclusively online thesedays - but is interest dropping in the whole phenomenon ShareCommentsByGavin AllenAssociate Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsIt wasnt hard to get to the shops in Glasgow city centre this morning \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritains biggest high streets and shops were quiet today as the hype around Black Friday failed to translate into footfall.On one of the biggest shopping days of the year - and what was become the starting gun for the Christmas shopping season -Brits are expected to spend pound. billion on deals in stores and online, according to predictions from the Centre for Retail Research.That sum would be down on the pound. billion splashed last year, suggesting that the days popularity may be waning already.Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in  the trend has been for high street shops to reduce instore bargains due to the chaos they brought.Amazon Prime worker Tessa Barrera tweeted this image of the queue outside the firms pop-up shop in Shoreditch, East London.

But despite signals that the day may be beginning to wane in popularity, a huge amount is still set to be spent.More than two fths of Britons are planning to spend in the Black Friday sales today amid warnings not to get carried away by the hype. A study by accountacy firm KPMG said % of Britons are looking forward to the event, and % are specically looking to buy Christmas presents - while % are intending to shop on Cyber Monday. Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: Retail performance throughout the year has been dreary to say the least, and weve certainly had a shaky start to the all-important golden quarter. Retailers will naturally be keen to make the most of these events, and our survey would certainly suggest that consumers are gearing up for it. However, consumer group Which  said its over-arching message to shoppers this year was to not feel pressured into spending after finding that nine in  Black Friday deals last year were the same price or even cheaper at other times of the year. It has urged consumers to be careful not to buy on impulse and instead research products and prices before spending in the sale. Alex Neill, Which  managing director of home products and services, said: While retailers are bombarding us with promises of great discounts and time-limited sales, its clear that not all deals are as good as they might appear. To bag a bargain, do your research and dont get carried away by the hype when shopping in the upcoming sales. Early indications suggest that Black Friday spending will dip for the first time this year since its arrival in the UK. Consumers will spend pound. billion on deals in stores and online, down from last years pound. billion, according to the predictions from the Centre for Retail Researchand VoucherCodes. Analyst Springboard has also said footfall and spending activity over this years Black Friday period is likely to be affected by economic pressures such as high debt levels and signicant living costs, compounded by the event taking place a week earlier this year - before many consumers are paid for the month. According to KPMGs study, the promotional period is favoured by younger consumers, with % of shoppers aged  to  saying they will be taking advantage of deals compared to % of  to  year olds, and just % of over s. Mr Martin added: Many shoppers are likely to recall how the slashed pricing in store resulted in stampedes, which is just not what mature consumers seek out. Since Black Friday was adopted by Britons back in , retailers have increasingly moved offers online, and that coincidentally is where a higher proportion of younger consumers can be found."},{"url":null,"title":"first picture 30 year old","story":"NewsFirst picture of -year-old GCSE pupil in Ipswich school CONFIRMED to be adultThe asylum seeker has been removed from Stoke High School, officials said, as they confirmed he is over the age of ShareByAdam Theofilatos:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe student has been removed from the school \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn asylum seeker posed as a -year-old student at a school in Ipswich, an investigation has revealed.The man - thought to be aged around  - was removed from the school after it was confirmed he is over the age of . Suspicions were aroused amongst fellow pupils because of his mature looks, which included his full beard and ft height. He spent six weeks at Stoke High School in Ipswich, Suffolk apparently as a Year  student. The Home Office has not confirmed how old the man is, however a classmate previously said: It’s like someone’s dad has come into school.  “He’s got a big beard, while the other boys I know are struggling to grow little moustaches. He’s very tall, around ft I’d say. “When I heard he was actually  years old I immediately told my mum.” Immigration services said that the pupil was assessed and is over  following investigation ordered by the Home Office. The man is now being treated an adult asylum seeker and could be thrown out of the UKhis claim is refused. It is believed that the asylum seeker sought a place at a secondary school after failing to find work because his qualications were not recognised. Horried parents pulled their children from the school in protest after the Snapchat image of the man appeared in the media. The image of the pupil, taken by another boy, was accompanied by the caption: “How is there a  year old man in our maths class.

A Home Office spokesman said: We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled. Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an iniduals age with precision. In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under . If an inidual is assessed to be under , but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case. The man, believed to be around  started at Stoke High School which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust in September. His younger brother, believed to be a year seven student has also been taken out of class but the Home office confirmed that he is a child.  The Home Office spokesperson added: When there is doubt about an iniduals claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authoritys social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made. If an inidual is assessed to be over , we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate. In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adulttheir physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are signicantly over  years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently. The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over  are assessed as adults.

Although the royal family arent like the rest of us, they still face this challenge when it comes to the winter months - but they have a lot of fun doing it. Instead of impressing with lavish, expensive gts, the royals reportedly have one rule when it comes to buying Christmas presents for each other. They simply have to exchange gts that are cheap and cheerful.  Its more about having a sense of humour than impressing with luxury presents. Kate Middleton showed she had great banter one year when she reportedly bought brother-in-law Harry a bit of a savage present. The prince, who was single at the time following a string of high-profile relationships, was given a grow-your-own-girlfriend kit by his sister-in-law. Ouch.  Its a testament to how close the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry arethey can appreciate a savage joke together. Harrys no stranger to a prank present, either, as he apparently once gave his grandmother, Her Majesty the Queen, a shower cap which said aint le a bitch on the front. Last year his then-fiance Meghan Markle reportedly gave the Queen a singing hamster toy which Her Maj loved - and so did the Corgis, as it was later reported one broke the toy.  Its safe to say Harry wont be needing a grow-your-own-girlfriend kit this year after marrying Meghan Markle in May. Hes also about to become a father as the Duke and Duchess baby is due in Spring . Kensington Palace announced Meghan is pregnant on October , the day the Duke and Duchess started their overseas royal tour in Oceania. They had a gruelling -day trip with a schedule containing  official engagements - and Meghan had to take a day off to rest at one point. Harry and Meghan are expected to join the rest of the royal family at Sandringham House in Norfolk this year, and the Queen has reportedly also extended an invitation to Meghans mum, Doria Ragland.

In the documentary William and Kate: The Journey, journalist Ashley Pearson describes what is said to have happened.  She said: “Royal sources tell me that the Royals indicated very strongly to Kate that they would prefer her to wear her hair up for this very special occasion. “However, Kate had her heart set on wearing her hair down with long flowing curls, which is her favourite way to wear it, and actually Williams favourite as well. In the end, Kate apparently went for a compromise and wore her hair half-up and half-down with curls.

Heidi Hepworth, , popped the question to taxi driver Salieu Jallow, , and says she has never been happier. She has started wearing a hijab and prays to Allah each day as she prepares for the wedding, set to take place next year in a mosque in The Gambia. Heidi told The Sun: “No-one imagined this would last but we love each other and are making plans to marry. I’ve never been happier.” She has been to West Africa four times to see Salieu and plans to move there once her orce is finalised. And she hit back at haters: I dont care what people think.  The couples love story began when he added her on Facebook out of the blue at a time when she was unhappy in her marriage. The pair began chatting and an online romance blossomed. Heidi eventually agreed to fly out to Gambia to meet Salieu last October for a one-month visit. It was daunting at first, she said. I got on the plane and thought oh my god what have I done  He met me off the plane with his brother and friend. And yeah it was alright.  At the time, husband Andy accused of her going through a mid-le crisis and said a caring mum wouldnt go off gallivanting around Africa. But Heidi hit back, saying her love for Salieu is genuine. She previously said: It was really hard for me to leave my kids, but they couldn’t come with me so I had no choice. If people think I went over to the Gambia and didn’t give them a second thought, they are so wrong.  “But having said that, I make no apologies for following my heart. I’ve been unhappy for a long time and I think I have found someone to spend the rest of my le with. Heidi, who has six children with Andy aged between six and , as well as three others from a previous relationship aged  to , appeared on Loose Women earlier this year where she defended her actions. And her decision to fly abroad sparked a child protection investigation, but police found her youngsters were being properly cared for by one of her grown-up children.  Heidi video-called her children every night while she was away and the children also speak regularly to Salieu. Car mechanic Andy blamed his wes online romance with Salieu for ruining their marriage, but she accused him of messaging other women behind her back - something he denied. During her month in Gambia, Heidi visited crocodile and monkey sanctuaries, as well as staying at Salieus family home. She also enjoyed strolls along sun-kissed beaches that felt a world away from her home in Sunderland.  Heidi says she will spend the rest of her le with her toyboy lover.

Whatever the Queen named the doll isnt clear, but it features a turquoise blue coat, curly blonde hair and blue eyes. Fashion and antiques auctioneer Kerry Taylor said that the rag-doll belonged to Her Majesty when she was a princess rather than a Queen back in the s. She would have been around nine or  years old probably when she got this doll, she said.   The toy is a Chad Valley doll and has glass eyes, a swivel head, a velvet body and jointed limbs. Kerry reckons it was well loved by young Elizabeth. You can see the little nose has been rubbed. It’s been heavily played with, she said. Kerry has estimated its value as pound-pound,, but said it would not surprise herthe doll went for more.   Its very rare that anything belonging to Her Majesty ever comes on the market, she added. As far as the auctioneer is aware, this is the first time a royal doll has come to market. The doll came to Kerry Taylor Auctions from the family of Clara Knight, who was a royal nanny to Princess Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret. Its not the only royal item thats set to be up for grabs.   Three floral dresses and other items worn by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret will be available to bid on. There will also be a beautul silk jersey dress worn by Princess Diana going up for auction. I think its one of the most beautul Diana dresses, Kerry said. It has this beautul bodice, all hand-embroidered with rhinestones and beads. And it was specially ordered by Elizabeth Emanuel and she only made the one, specically for the Princess. So its a real one-off. Its spectacular. The estimated value of the dress, which was purchased from a second-hand dress shop in Hereford in , is a whopping pound,-pound,. The Passion for Fashion auction is at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on December .

This really is a destination for hunters to fulfil some European slams.”   A “world record class animal” can cost pound,. The fee for shooting a smaller red stags falls in stages from pound,, to pound,, to pound,, right down to pound,. Accommodation, flights and meals are extra. On the website is a picture of a man holding the horns of a huge animal, with a telescopic sight over its neck. A caption reads: “New world record red stag in England. Aaron and guests hunted  days in Woburn [Beds] and Norfolk. It was in Norfolk they put down some monster fallow deer.” Woburn Abbey was quick to distance itself, saying: “It is highly likely this party was hunting in the Woburn area with no connection to the Bedford Estates.”  Mr Bulkley boasts on the website that he has been awarded “guide of the year”and “outfitter of the year” titles many times. But Europehunts’s brazen selling has appalled animal lovers.Chris Luffingham, of the League Against Cruel Sports, says: “It is sickening to know that trophy hunting is taking place here in the heart of the UK.” The pressure group Bedfordshire Against Trophy Hunting started a petition to try and get the hunting stopped.

On crowded planes these days, spills are inevitable. Especially in times of turbulence and tiny trays, passengers very easily can accidentally spill something down themselves. Thankfully, cabin crew are on hand to help, and apparently they have a rather unusual method of doing so. Flight attendant Emily Witkop has explained how they can use a sanitary towel to remove a fresh stain from a top - and you may want to give it a try at home.  One trick is not only to use the ever-handy club soda to lt the stain but to put in on a sanitary napkinto blot the stain, she explained to the NY Post. She notes that, unlike paper towels or napkins, absorbent sanitary towels dont leave residue on your clothing - which is ideal for cleaning stains. However, Emily admits some people are a bit unnerved by this strategy to cleaning. You must use good judgement on who you offer this solution to, she said. They will either love it or be absolutely horried.  Emily also revealed some other in-flight secrets. Apparently flight attendants are very switched on when it comes to passengers trying to sneak off to join the Mile High Club. If the flight isnt busy, some attendants may turn a blind eye, according to the article. Emily said she will often give lovers a knowing look to put them off getting some bathroom action. The flight attendant questions why anyone would want to - as bathrooms on aeroplanes are pretty gross.

The case of the missing Beaumont children and the unidentied tall, blond man gripped Australia and the wider world after the youngsters mysteriously vanished in . Jane, nine, Arnna, seven, and Grant, four, left their family home on January  and headed for Glenelg Beach near Adelaide in the south of the country. Their mum Nancy stuffed a total of six shillings into their pockets for bus fare and lunch and waved them goodbye. That was the last time she, and her husband Jim, would ever see their young children again. Nancy, now , expected them tohome at midday, and became worried when they still hadnt shown up when Jim arrived home from work at around pm.   Two hours later, the frantic parents reported the children missing - unaware they were about to enter a decades-long hunt for their children. Within  hours, news of their disappearance had spread across Australia and reports came in of them last being seen with a tall blond man who seemed in his mid s, reports MammaMia. Witnesses said they had seen the children playing on the beach with the man, before they later went to a nearby bakery to buy lunch. Suspicions of the man they were spotted with soon grew into fears they had been abducted, after it emerged they used a pound note to buy pasties for themselves and an extra meat pie for an unknown person.   Nancy told police she had not given them any notes on the morning they left home and that her children never ate meat pies. Police believed this indicated the unidentied fair-headed man was still with the children at the time they bought lunch. As the police search escalated, detectives desperately searched for some of the  items they had on the persons at the time - including clothing, towels and a bag. Despite their best efforts, not of these items were ever recovered. The case even saw a Dutch psychic Gerard Croiset being flown in to help track down the children and bring up any potential leads.  Two days after first being reported missing, their mum Nancy had become so traumatised by their disappearance, she was put under sedation by a doctor. Five days later after the children left home, their father Jim made an emotional plea to anyone who may have or know where the children were. In the following weeks and months, the heartbroken parents retreated from the public eye and cut off all connection with the media. Earlier this year, fresh leads led police to search a factory in North Plympton, but the dig only found animal bones.  Chief superintendent Des Bray said: There has been nothing human located on the site. Sadly, this means for the Beaumont family that we still have no answers. Over the years, police released computer generated images of the children and how they may look having aged. It was widely reported Nancy never once looked at the images and was traumatised every time an updated CGI image was released In the early s, Nancy and Jim split up and sold the home they desperately hoped their children would one dayto.

We’ve been good in recent years and been nearly there, just missing out here and there but on Tuesday we won, we top the group and can be happy.“I think we’re very together as a team and there is a lot of belief, a lot of unity and a lot of confidence and the win on Tuesday only enhances that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee dealt major injury blow as striker set for surgery","story":"Dundee have been dealt a major injury blow with news that striker Benjamin Kallman will need an operation to fix a knee problem.The Finland U  international had been suffering from an issue with his knee in recent weeks and it was initially hoped he would be fit for the Hibs clash this weekend.However, the Dark Blues have been given the bad news that the -year-old will need to go under the kne.

I’ve been very pleased with what we’ve seen from him so far.”Curran’s role has changed under the new manager after previous boss Neil McCann wanted to develop him into an attacking full-back.McIntyre, though, sees him further up the pitch where he can use his pace to hurt opposing teams more directly.Also able to play as a central midfielder, Curran’s versatility has its uses for a manager but Jim has urged the young Aussie to “nail down a position” to really fulfil the potential he sees in him.The Dens boss said: “I see him playing further forward rather than right-back, though I know he can play there. He has that athleticism you need to play full-back, wing-back as well but I think you can get goals out of him.“He’s versatile but I think sometimes with players you need to nail down a position so we’re trying to do that with Jesse.“But I definitely see him in the midfield area.”Curran is expected to continue in that right-wing role for the Dark Blues at Hibs on Saturday despite having fit-again Roarie Deacon as competition.The former Sutton United man missed the draw with St Mirren with a thigh strain but trained this week and is available.Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp sven-goran-eriksson-wants-dundee-youngster-jesse-curran embed # secretxcPQdfeTm\" data-secret\"xcPQdfeTm\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Sven-Goran Eriksson wants Dundee youngster Jesse Curran# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bf3f4dff169b-e1542721422611.jpg ","title":"no parking bus at hibees for dundee","story":"Jim McIntyre has no plans to park the bus this coming weekend as his Dundee side travel to free-scoring Hibs in the Premiership.The Dark Blues have the leakiest defence in the ision while the Hibees have notched  in five league matches at Easter Road ahead of their clash on Saturday.The Dens gaffer is under no illusions how tough it will be against Neil Lennon’s side, though he’s seen encouragement from his side over the past couple of matches.And he’s planning to put their opponents “under pressure” as his side aim for a much-needed result.He said: “Things were taken on from the Motherwell game and things were more positive with the St Mirren performance and it’s about trying to turn small margins into points.“We know we are facing a top side in Hibs who have done a fantastic job this season, are an exciting team to watch and have a lot of attacking threat but we have to go there and put them under pressure.”Of late, however, the Hibees haven’t won in their last four – but that recent form won’t change how Dundee prepare.“You are going to have peaks and troughs through any season but I’m sure them being at home Lenny will have them fired up,” added Jim.“We know they have good players and will be looking to take maximum points but from our own end the encouraging signs have been there and we want to try to build on the St Mirren result.“The boys clearly know how I work now after a month.

He defends well and can play long balls when it’s needed.“I think what goes unrecognised is thathe is told to pass the ball Scott is more than willing to step forward and find a pass.“That is important because in modern day football there are a lot of managers wanting their defenders to step in and pass the ball.“That’s certainly the case in England – maybe at Aberdeen they play more direct, I don’t know.“But for Scotland you can see that Scott is good at both.”"},{"url":null,"title":"marks getting rey dy to show staying power","story":"Injured Dons defender Mark Reynolds says he wants to stay at Pittodrie beyond the summer.Reynolds hasn’t featured for Aberdeen this season after rupturing a cruciate ligament in a pre-season friendly against Cove Rangers at the Balmoral Stadium on July .The -year-old’s contract with the Reds is up next summer.Reynolds, who joined the Dons on loan in  before signing permanently in January , is keen to stay at the club.

former Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that there is currently no majority in the House of Commons to pass a Brexit agreement, but he expects the UK to avoid a “no-deal” option.Lord Darling, who controlled the UK’s finances under Prime Minister Gordon Brown between  and , was speaking after he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Aberdeen University yesterday.He told the Evening Express: “I’ve always believed that a deal will be done, although it’s quite possible that it will be eleventh hour, because you have to get it through the House of Commons.“And it’s clear that there isn’t a majority for anything other than no-deal.“However, I think that a deal will be done, because it will be calamitous for the UK to drop out with no-deal, and it would be equally as bad for the rest of the European Union.“A no-deal is just not worth thinking about.”The former Chancellor also questioned the protests of politicians in favour of leaving the European Union to the current agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May.He said: “Where did leavers think that we were going to end up “There has never been a trade deal in the world where one side gets exactly what it wants, and the other side get absolutely nothing in .“It’s the uncertainty that worries me, which will affect the north-east, the rest of Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom.”Lord Darling also pointed to the effect that Brexit may have on his former university.He said: “Just look at this university, the contracts that it’s got through the European research funds.“We live in a global world, you can’t just close the door and say ‘we’re closed’.“It doesn’t work like that.”During his address to the graduates, Lord Darling spoke of the “isive” nature of the current political climate.Lord Darling said that the Conservative Party has a particular ide over Europe.He said: “There is something about Europe that does something to the Conservative Party, it was like that the whole time that I was there, it does something to people.“Butyou look at the younger generation, they don’t think it’s a particularly big deal.“Just look at the ersity on show here during this graduation, it reflects the global world in which we live.”Lord Darling also said that he can’t see who would take over from Prime Minister Theresa May should she be the subject of a vote of no confidence.He said: “Realistically, I can’t imagine who would take over the Tories right now, because the same fate would await them.”Speaking after the ceremony, the member of the House of Lords had some advice for graduating students.He said: “Do what you feel good about.“A good education will enable you to do most things, but you’ll be constantly changing and learning new things, because most people do several things in their lives.“A degree doesn’t usually see people through to the time where they’re picking up their gold

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge wants to repay the kindness shown to them

to get across what were often highly complex issues, against a background of half-truths and disinformation.Remember the £ million on the side of a bus and spending irregularities There was no clear

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

But theres a time when resilience turns into defiance, and then defiance turns into delusion. Theresa Mayrsquos staying power is the nations curse, as she perseveres with a orce deal which has no hope. She has finally united Leavers and Remainers, but only to the extent that theyrsquore against her. Shes lost both her Brexit Secretaries, a host of ministers and both houses of parliament. But, like Monty Pythonrsquos limbless Black Knight, she battles on regardless.MPs on all sides say the European Court of Justice will continue to have effective jurisdiction over UK laws on things like state aid, labour conditions, environmental standards and tax. Theresa May insists it wonrsquot, and that by , a deep and meaningful future trading relationship will have been negotiated, which will make the backstop unnecessary. But that is a triumph of hope over experience. No one has yet come up with a way of ensuring frictionless trade that doesnt involve either membership of the Customs Union, or accepting many of the rules of the European Single Market. If you keep all or part of the single market you keep the ECJ.This doesnt mean that the ECJ is involved in every negotiation. There is to be an arbitration  to sort out everyday problems between the EU and UK. But when it comes to a dispute on EU law, the ECJ rulings are final. That is crystal clear in Article  of the Withdrawal Agreement which says that the ECJ ldquoshall have jurisdiction to make such a ruling, which will be binding on the arbitration .Theres nothing sinister in this ndash except in the eyes of paranoid europhobes. When you join a tennis club, no one complains that your rights and liberties are being removed just because you accept the rules. The real issue is whether you have any say in the making of them. Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amSome Orkney Islands Council facilities, such as schools, care homes and marine services,  may face IT disruption this weekend as the council carries out further repairs to a vital fibre optic link which was damaged on November .

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Friday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

a package including the political declaration and the -page withdrawal agreement setting out the terms of the ‘orce’ from the EU - to be approved by European leaders at a special summit on Sunday.“The draft text that we have agreed with the Commission is a good deal for our country and for our partners in the EU,” told the House of Commons.“It honours the vote of the British people by taking back control of our borders, our laws and our money while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our precious United Kingdom.”As many as  Conservative MPs have publicly declared they will not vote for the deal.• : Brexit: UK and EU agree outline for trade and security talksA Downing Street charm offensive aimed at convincing eurosceptics that a backstop plan for the Irish border can be avoided using “alternative” customs technologies appeared to have failed, with Iain Duncan Smith telling Mrs May that “none of this is at all workable” unless the withdrawal agreement is renegotiated.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit Secretary, claimed the backstop “ties the UK to the customs union and single market rules with no voice” and will be used by the EU as “the starting point for future relations to build on”.Mr Raab said Brexit voters wanted to “take back control” but said it was “the regrettable but inescapable reality that this deal gives even more away”.And the chief whip of the DUP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, also called on the Prime Minister to renegotiate, telling her: “If she wants to have the support of my party for the withdrawal agreement then we need to see an end to the backstop and those alternative arrangements put in place.”• : PM’s Brexit document is  pages of waffle, Jeremy Corbyn claimsMrs May told MPs that “the best way to ensure the backstop is not used is to get the future relationship into place” before the end of the post-Brexit transition phase, which is scheduled to end in December , but could be extended as far as the end of talks drag on.The draft political declaration outlines the objectives for trade and security cooperation after Brexit.European Council president Donald Tusk announced it had been “agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level” and sent to Britain’s  European partners for further consideration.“The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders,” he added.An earlier draft of the declaration came to seven pages, but the final version is now  pages long.Unlike the withdrawal agreement, the political declaration is not legally binding, but is linked to the UK’s ‘orce’ terms.The UK Government has said that the withdrawal agreement, including the £bn financial settlement, will not be enacted without the political declaration.Jeremy Corbyn criticised the trade outline, calling it “ pages of waffle” and a blueprint for a deal that is the “worst of all worlds”.“The only certainty contained within these pages is that the transition period will have to be extended or we will end up with a backstop and no exit,” the Labour leader told MPs.“It represents the worst of all worlds, no say over the rules that will continue to apply and no certainty to the future.”He added: “We have  pages of waffle, this empty document could have been written two years ago.”Mr Corbyn also called on the PM to “abandon her poisonous rhetoric” on immigration.Instead of negotiating a “new, comprehensive customs union”, he said the Tories were more interested in “dog whistling on immigration”.Focusing on fishing, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called the document “an absolute dereliction of the promises Scottish Conservative members and [Environment Secretary Michael Gove] made to Scotland - shame on them.”He askedher Scottish MPs and Scottish Secretary David Mundell had agreed to the political declaration, adding: “Is it not the case that she’s just lost further critical votes on the deal because Scottish Tory MPs could not possibly vote in favour of this sell out of Scottish fishing interests ”The Prime Minister was expected to speak to a number of EU leaders last night. She acknowledged that she must still convince some of them to back the deal, with the Spanish Prime Minister threatening to vote against it because the political declaration does not grant Madrid a veto over the application of future trade agreements in Gibraltar.Speaking in Downing Street before addressing MPs, the Prime Minister said she had spoken to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Wednesday night and was “confident that on Sunday we will be able to agree a deal that delivers for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.”Two-thirds of the  other EU members must agree to the deal for it to be approved.Last night Mrs May met Austria’s chancellor in London ahead of Sunday’s summit. Ahead of the meeting, Sebastian Kurz said he hoped to get a “realistic picture” of May’s chances of getting the deal through Westminster, and warned: “Reopening the deal is not an option.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833891.1542920011!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may denies fishermen being sold out for sake of deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged the interests of Scotland#s fishermen will be protected after Brexit despite being accused of using the industry as a #bargaining chip# in the negotiations.The details of how future UK-EU relations will work on issues such as trade and security were outlined yesterday in a draft agreement.Mrs May has insisted the political declaration is “the right plan for the UK”, which will set the country on course for a brighter future.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Tory government at Westminster was preparing to “sell out” the Scottish fishing industry.Following EU withdrawal, the UK will no longer be part of the Common Fisheries Policy , which is unpopular with the industry in Scotland.The UK Government’s draft agreement on post-Brexit relations says the UK will be an “independent coastal nation”.The Scottish Fishermen’s Federation gave the plan a cautious welcome, but the First Minister said it amounted to a “Tory sell-out”.Asked about the issue at First Minister’s Questions, she said: “The political declaration that has been agreed between the UK Government and the European Commission this morning represents another Tory sell- out of Scottish fishermen.“What we see is that the Scottish fishing industry will be used as a bargaining chip in wider trade talks.”She recalled last week all  Scottish Tory MPs sent a letter to Mrs May, making clear that after Brexit the UK “must be able to negotiate access and quota shares on an annual basis without any pre-existing arrangement being in force” and “this means that access and quota shares cannot be included in the future economic partnership”.But she said paragraph  of the declaration stated: “Within the context of the overall economic partnership, the parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on access to waters and quota share.”She added: “There is no mention of annual negotiations, which I happen to know the UK Government was trying to secure and they failed. In terms of David Mundell’s position I would simply say this – his position is a matter for him, butDavid Mundell is still in office by the end of today in light of this political declaration he will have forfeited forever any last remaining scrap of principle or credibility that he had.”Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson branded the political declaration “unacceptable” as he said the UK “must be a normal independent coastal state like Norway”.He tweeted the “political declaration commits UK to establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares” and added: “This means sovereignty over our waters sacriced for a trade deal.”Mr Mundell said he was “not taking lessons on standing up for fisherman from Nicola Sturgeon, who is committed to trapping them in hated CFP”.He added: “The PM has fiercely resisted the efforts of EU states to make an explicit link between access to our waters and access to markets.“We will negotiate and decide, as an independent coastal state, on access and quota on an annual basis just like Norway and Iceland do now. The surest way to guarantee the EU access to Scottish waters would be to rejoin the CFP – exactly what Nicola Sturgeon is demanding.”Addressing the issue of fishing rights in the Commons yesterday, Mrs May said the agreement reached with the EU would not be “traded off” against other priorities.Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation, said: “The declaration gives the UK the power to assert its position as an independent coastal state with practical sovereignty over our waters.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833802.1542916079!/image/image.jpg","title":"alastair dalton we need genuinely cyclable cities by reassigning road space","story":"Inside Transport: One of the joys of cycling is riding along a smooth, traffic-free path, writes Alastair Dalton.If that also involves whizzing past vehicles at a standstill on an congested road next door, so much the better for your choice of transport.I also like the look of rural off-road sections of the national cycle network in Scotland,  per cent of which has just been officially judged as being in a good or very good condition.Viewed from the train on the Edinburgh-Glasgow route via Bathgate and Airdrie, you can follow the still pristine-looking cycle path which was rebuilt eight years ago when the line was re-opened.Other stretches of the network, such as between Oban and Fort William, look even more alluring.Unfortunately, the picture is the opposite on road sections of the network, with the official survey by cycling and walking body Sustrans finding  per cent of them in poor condition.That’s borne out by my own experience, with other cycle lanes in such a bad state they deter riders venturing on to them.Too often such lanes remain potholed while the rest of the road has been repaired or resurfaced, too narrow for cyclists to feel safe, and blocked by parked vehicles when no driver would dare park across a road.Some cycle lanes start and then suddenly peter out, sometimes with a kerb built out across them. Signs and markings can be inconsistent and even contradictory, as to be of no help to cyclist or driver alike.Advanced stop lines at traffic lights, a crucial safety feature for riders turning right, frequently have worn-out markings which render them invisible even to motorists who know it’s illegal to stop on them.Off-road paths may be in better nick, and there’s normally more space to ride round the potholes, but they are also plagued by other horrors such as tree roots distorting surfaces that make for an uncomfortably bumpy.Incomplete sections have become white elephants, such as the Bears Way between Glasgow and Milngavie, a segregated . mile route created by narrowing the busy A which requires cyclists to merge back into the traffic at either end.Against a background of ministers imploring us to cycle more, it’s a distinctly uninviting prospect. From this evidence on the ground, cycling is demonstrably not being afforded its place in the transport pecking order that the policymakers have given it.What’s needed is the creation of genuinely cyclable cities, a genuinely cyclable country. What we have are piecemeal sections of adequate cycle paths that require riders to run the gauntlet of hazards to get between them.Cycle lanes need to be given enhanced status to reflect their importance in helping to literally pave the way for the signicant increase in cycling the Scottish Government wants.Its “vision” has been of  per cent of trips being made by bike by  - a gigantic rise from around  per cent with little more than a year to achieve it.Space for cycling on roads should be reserved and respected for the myriad benefits it brings, from reducing congestion and pollution to the health benefits for riders and the reduced toll on the NHS.It’s not impossible. Russian city of Almetyevsk increased its cycling rate from zero to  per cent in  months. It’s all about who gets priority on the roads and how much we’re prepared to sht the balance.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4833671.1542921727!/image/image.jpg","title":"driverless buses to start edinburgh fife journeys within months","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots commuters will be the first in the UK to travel on driverless buses when a pilot is introduced to run vehicles over the Forth Road Bridge between Edinburgh and Fe.Bus giant Stagecoach will operate the new trial service, expected in , which will see five single-deck buses carrying  passengers travelling  miles from Ferrytoll Park and Ride in Fe to the Edinburgh Park tram exchange, near the Gyle.With buses every  minutes, this could provide an estimated , weekly journeys.The buses will be used autonomously to “level four” standard, meaning a driver must remain on board during any journey in line with UK regulations.The initiative is part of a UK-wide trial of driverless vehicles, which will see two other pilots of “autonomous” taxi services taking place in London. The Scottish scheme received £. million of a £m UK grant to help make driverless technology on UK streets a reality.Scottish Government Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: “This is a very exciting development and underlines the potential Scotland has when it comes to connected and autonomous vehicles. The Forth has been at the centre of engineering innovation over three centuries and it is fitting that it will be central to this next innovation in transport and our Programme for Government commitments to intelligent mobility.: Man arrested after rocks thrown at Ruth Davidson’s Edinburgh office“The deployment of these vehicles in Scotland will bring transformative change to the way we travel and work, as well as having a positive impact on the economy, the environment and safety.”Work on the vehicles is being carried out at busmaker Alexander Dennis’s site in Guildford, with the buses expected to be ready for use at the start of . In the short term, the buses will be used in driverless mode within the depot to carry out movements such as parking and moving into the fuelling station and bus wash.The system uses several sensors, including radar, laser, camera and ultrasound along with satellite navigation, to detect and avoid objects and plan routes.Improved safety, reduced congestion, increased effic­iency and lower staffing costs have been billed among potential benefits of driverless buses.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: “I’m delighted that Edinburgh has been chosen as a base for this exciting project.“The city is a hotbed for innovation and this £.m grant is welcome further support for Scotland’s research and technology sectors. The UK government’s Modern Industrial Strategy [published last year] is investing in the UK’s future through innovation. Autonomous vehicles are just one example of that commitment in driving the UK forward.”Stagecoach, Alexander Dennis and technology firm Fusion Processing announced earlier this year that work was underway to trial the first full-sized autonomous vehicle.The bus will use both on-road and hard shoulder running, and will operate on the “old” Forth Road Bridge, which is now a dedicated public transport corridor allowing buses and taxis to usededicated lanes between the M near Newbridge and Halbeath in Fe.In London, Project Apollo, led by Addison Lee, who are working with a number of software companies, will receive £. million towards the development of autonomous taxis, building on its existing tests in Greenwich.A second pilot in the capital, ServCity – headed up by Jaguar Land Rover – takes £. million of the funding as it develops a mobility service using six autonomous Land Rover Discovery vehicles. UK government Business Secretary Greg Clark said: “Autonomous vehicles and their technology will not only revolutionise how we travel, it will open up and improve transport services for those who struggle to access both private and public transport. “The UK is building on its automotive heritage and strengths to develop the new vehicles and technologies and from  the public will get to experience the future for themselves.” Mr Clark was taken on a test vehicle run by autonomous vehicle software company Oxbotica – the first person outside its technical team to try the autonomous mode anywhere on the streets of the United Kingdom.All the projects will include social behavioural research to understand how driverless technology can be integrated into society and applied to the development for future autonomous service models.The Centre for Connected Autonomous Vehicleswas established in  to ensure the UK was a world leader in the development and testing of self-driving technologies.A total of £m, match-funded by industry, is being invested by the UK Government, propelling self-driving technology in the UK.The UK Modern Industrial Strategy published last year aims to invest in science and research to keep the UK at the forefront of new technologies and the benefits they bring by nurturing the “talent of tomorrow.”Join our Facebook group Our Edinburgh to share images and news from and around the Capital ©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when the doors will actually re-open for HLH cardholders but there was no response.It is understood the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in the final year to maintain access to the pool. The councils initial offer was to continue to pay pound, per year but later upped that to include index linked increases either CPI or . per cent and users also paying pound.or pound per family fixed for the three-year period.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated. Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all. It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it. There have been no discussions with them on the route map.Quizzed on their funding role she said there had been no talks with them yet.There have been calls the operator to be removed by owners HIE because of a loss of faith in them and a lack of investment with pound.m pledged in  not materialising.Charlotte Wright, HIE chief executive, said: \"Clearly poundm, even over  years, is a large investment for a single resort, and funding is often the most challenging of all obstacles.\"Highland Council convener Bill Lobban said the uplt review provides \"a fantastic, positive view of the potential future for Cairngorm\".The report also says there should be improved transport links between Cairngorm and the broader Aviemore area to ease pressure on car parking.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117294.jpg","title":"Hotel boss set for talks on Aviemore pool wrangle","story":"Thebossof Macdonald Hotels has said that talks will reopen with Highland Council later this month over access to the Macdonald Aviemore Resort pool.Donald Macdonald, chairman and founder of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said \"there has always been a real willingness on our part to reach a sustainable deal\".Members of High Le Highland have been unable to use the resortrsquos pool since the end of August because of a funding wrangle.The hotel group is seeking more funding than has been put on the table by Highland Council.Macdonald Hotels has mainly remained silent since the end of the summer.But the Strathy received a y statement yesterday from the company on the latest situation, and also criticising a local Highland councillor for his intervention at council headquarters on the wrangle.In the statement, Mr Macdonald said: \"There is nothing that would please us more than having this situation resolved.\"In fact, wersquod already written to the council underlining how keen we were to have further talks and welcomed the positive interventions by Drew Hendry MP and Kate Forbes MSP, who have taken a mature, non-partisan approach to matters.\"He then went on to attack Councillor John Bruce for a question he put before the full council in Inverness a week ago.In it he quizzed leader Margaret Davidson on the role of public money in securing public access for swimming at the resort.The hotel boss described Councillor John Brucersquos question as \"poorly-researched, fatuous and ill-informed\".The statement went on: \"Hersquos showing breath-taking cheek in attempting to re-write history, so itrsquos worth rehearsing the facts, both for his benefit but more so for local people.\"In , a partnership of Bank of Scotland, Tulloch and ourselves brought forward ambitious plans to invest poundm at the Aviemore Resort which had fallen into disrepair after many years of neglect, to the extent that it was described at the time as lsquohaving all the charm of a disused air raid shelterrsquo.\"Given the enormous potential benefits of this scheme to the local and Highland economies, and the large numbers of jobs which would be created, Highlands  Islands Enterprise supported the project with a grant of pound.m - not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost.

I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

Documents released under FoI legislation reveal how  decisions that cannot be taken have piled up in the absence of ministers. The figure will be higher because one of the nine departments, the Department of Finance, refused to answer our request.Some have been well publicised, such as the Programme for Government, which sets out the priorities that the Executive will pursue. Approval is also needed on a strategy to deal with suicide, an investment strategy and school development plans.However, there is also a range of lesser known legislation.This includes fishery management plans, remote control automated parking, reforming legal aid expenditure and amending the  Drainage Order.The Department for Communities has  decisions pending - the highest number.Among them is the Employment Act, which includes proposals to force large companies to disclose their gender pay gap. This has been held up by more than  days.A further  decisions are in line at the Department for Infrastructure.These include increasing penalties for using a mobile phone while driving, a series of planning applications and a planned trial scheme to allow certain taxis to use Belfasts bus lanes.The Department for the Economy has  decisions pending, including sign-off on a draft industrial strategy, draft energy strategy and a Superfast Broadband strategy.The Department of Justice has  outstanding decisions, including strategies on domestic violence and tackling paramilitary crime.At the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, decisions on fishery management and water quality monitoring have sat for more than  days.Several departments cannot make public appointments. For example, the Policing Board, which has oversight of the PSNI, has not met since early  because it has no political appointees.The DUP and Sinn Fein continue to blame each other for the impasse.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: \"Every day new issues arise which cannot be progressed because of Sinn Feins boycott policy.\"The public are suffering and limited powers for civil servants to take decisions are no substitute for democratically-elected representatives taking decisions in the best interests of everyone we represent.\"The DUP has put down no pre-conditions ahead of theof devolution. Its time that Sinn Fein dropped their red lines and put the needs of the public ahead of their narrow sectional interests.\"Sinn Fein said: \"It is the DUPs denial of rights, disrespect and lack of integrity that led to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions.\"Rather than commit to sharing power equally, the DUP then walked away from an agreement in February that would have seen the Assembly and the Executive restored.\"The institutions could be restored immediatelythe DUP, backed by the Tories, ends the disgraceful denial of rights which are enjoyed by citizens everywhere  on these islands.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland electricity could face hundreds of compensation claims after couple given 15000 for pylon","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The McKibbins solicitor, John Gibbons, predicted the test case verdict could open the floodgates to a huge number of similar claims.He said: \"This case now opens the way for all similarly affected homeowners, whose use and enjoyment of their property is diminished by power lines or NIE equipment, to seek suitable compensation. \"There are already many claims lodged with the Lands Tribunal that will now have to be dealt with and we anticipate many hundreds of new claimants will now come forward.\"NIE Networks Ltd mounted appeals following Lands Tribunal decisions related to installations on both industrial and residential property.Under current legislation land owners and occupiers can seek compensation for involuntary \"wayleaves\" required to place equipment and cabling.In one case the Tribunal had awarded £, compensation to cover a drop in market value of Brickkiln Waste Ltds land in Maydown, Derry.Setting aside that award, the court held there had been a failure to demonstrate any diminution.Turning to Mr and Mrs McKibbins case, however, Sir Reg Weir set out how they had requested the removal of NIE equipment after the last of their voluntary agreements ended in .The couple stated that their enjoyment of their house and garden was impaired by birds on the tower leaving droppings on the garden and car beneath.Reference was made to the wires making a \"singing\" noise in some weather conditions, along with dficulties in maintaining their garden due to the pylons legs.\"They describe the tower in their garden as a monstrosity, a description which from the photographs does not seem an exaggeration,\" Sir Reg said.The court also heard a Bank of Ireland policy document expressed reluctance to lend on properties where high power lines pass over the house or garden except in exceptional circumstances.The public perception, whether or not well-founded, is that the health of those living close to power lines may be adversely affected, according to the McKibbins evidence.NIE appealed the Tribunals decision that £, compensation should be paid to reflect the potential drop in the worth of their property.But based on an examination of the evidence and photographs, Sir Reg held that it was fully entitled to assess the diminution in value at %.He added: \"Had it to make its own lay assessment,would have arrived at a figure certainly no less than that.\" The McKibbins were also awarded all their legal costs.Outside court their lawyer confirmed he will be seeking to have other similar cases listed for hearing as soon as possible.Mr Gibbons added: \"As the negative perception of electricity equipment very close to residential property,continues to grow, these types of claims are bound to become more prevalent. \"They are common place in the rest of the UK, where power line companies have been compensating homeowners for decades.  \"Unfortunately, up to now, NIE Networks appears to have preferred to fight every claim and bury their head in the sand.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37559460.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/st_patricks_2.jpg","title":"oxford union votes down motion on reunification of ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irish signs for UU student unions comes under fire  Ulster University to introduce Irish language signs at Students Union  The Ulster University has four campuses, one in Belfast, Coleraine, Jordanstown and Londonderry.Each location has their own students union.Ulster Young Unionist Chairman Joshua Lowry expressed concern that a \"hierarchy of equality\" is being introduced at Ulster University.The Young Unionists are the youth wing of the Ulster Unionist Party.Mr Lowry outlined his groups reasons for opposing the plan.“Firstly, it creates a hierarchy of equality that suggests that Irish is more important than all the other languages spoken at the University, including - but not limited to - Mandarin, Polish, Portuguese and Ulster-Scots.“Secondly, this political stunt has nothing to do with promoting the use of the Irish language and everything to do with attempting to make the University a cold house for unionists, and others who do not support the republican agenda in the University. \"We feel that this will create an unwelcoming atmosphere at the University, and will further dissuade unionists from choosing to attend Ulster University.\"The Young Unionists Chairman said thatthe plans go-ahead the group would report it to the Equality Commission.    “Irish language signs were taken down from Queen’s University Belfast in  because the Fair Employment Commission concluded at the time that it created a chill factor amongst Protestant students, did not in any way spread… the use of the Irish language and was just being used as an excuse for tokenism,\" Mr Lowry said. \"We have written to the Vice Chancellor of Ulster University to ask that the same logic be applied, or we will be forced to report the matter to the Equality Commission.“Ulster University has a responsibility to staff and students to ensure that it provides equality to all, and that it is a safe space for open and respectful learning and debate. It would be sheer folly to allow this University to turn into one that values one community over another.”Sinn Fein have welcomed the plans, while TUV leader Jim Allister and UUP Education spokesperson Rosemary Barton said the move would make unionist students feel uncomfortable.

He said it would focus on behaviour, on corporate governance and risk management."},{"url":null,"title":"grenfell tower resident asked if helicopter could be sent","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Khan lauded the Karachi police and the paramilitary rangers, saying they showed exceptional courage in defending the consulate and that the “nation salutes the martyrs”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Volunteers wait outside the Chinese Consulate after an attack in Karachi He ordered an investigation and vowed that such incidents would never be able to undermine relations with China, which are “mightier than the Himalayas and deeper than the Arabian Sea”.The attackers stormed the consulate shortly after am local time.

Local TV broadcast images showing smoke rising from the building, which also serves as the residence of Chinese diplomats and other staff.“Because of a quick response of the guards and police, the terrorists could not” reach the diplomats, Mr Sheikh said after the fighting ended. “We have completed the operation, and a search is still under way to trace and capture all suspects.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Security officials gather outside the compound of the Chinese Consulate He added that one of the attackers was wearing a suicide vest and that authorities would try to identy the assailants through fingerprints.Dr Seemi Jamali, a spokeswoman at the Jinnah Hospital, said the bodies of two police officers were brought to the hospital while one of the consulate guards who was wounded, is under treatment.Most of the victims in the bomb attack in the town of Klaya were minority Shiite Muslims. Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Orakzai has been the scene of several militant attacks in recent years, mostly by Pakistani Sunni militants.In its claim of responsibility for the Karachi consulate attack, the Baluch Liberation Army,

condition","story":"A Ballinderry mum says she intends to raise more awareness of an advanced treatment for a rare spinal condition in that hope that it will be made available to children in the North.Donna Ferris’ three year-old son Charlie was diagnosed with progressive infantile idiopathic scoliosis when he was just six months old.If left untreated, the spinal deformity can lead to severe twisting of the spine, respiratory problems and even decreased le expectancy.When little Charlie was first diagnosed back in February , doctors in Belfast told his anxious parents Donna and Jodie that their only option was to put their son in a plaster jacket to hold in the curve in his spine until he was old enough for surgery.However, determined Donna vowed to do everything in her power to keep her baby son away from the operating table and invasive surgery.After hours of online research, the mum-of-four found a hospital in the United States which offers specialised scoliosis treatment.Donna discovered that Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia offered advanced treatment which could potentially avoid surgery.She said: “When I was researching I checked for hospitals in the east coast of America as I knew it would be easier to fly into there from Ireland.  I came across Shriners Hospital and made contact straight away askingthey accepted international patients.  They said they did and sent me some forms which I filled in.  Within four days of applying to the hospital for the treatment Charlie was accepted, and within a month he was at the hospital.”On April , , Donna, Jodie and their four kids made the trip to Philadelphia for Charlie’s first appointment.Just a few days later, Charlie was fitted with a Mehta cast which was specially designed to correct the curve in his spine.Over the last  months, Charlie has made the same journey  times.Before having his first cast fitted, the curvature in Charlie’s spine was at a -degree angle.Earlier this month, during their th trip to Shriners Hospital, the Ferris family received the news they had been hoping for.“They took Charlie’s brace off  hours after arriving at the hospital and sent him for x-rays.  After this the doctors brought us in and gave us the great news that Charlie’s spine is now down to six degrees,” said Donna.“I just burst into tears crying.  I just couldn’t believe it.  The staff at the hospital were also crying and hugging us.  They were just so, so happy.  They are always willing the children on there.  It was just amazing news to get.”Donna said before starting his treatment in the US, Charlie was a ‘very restless baby’ and she ‘really struggled to get food into him’.Now, she says her son is a completely dferent person.“The boy we have now is just perfect.  He is meeting all his milestones and is doing everything a wee child of his age should be doing and he will go on to lead a healthy le,” she said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Charlie knows that he’s dferent and he has to wear a brace that not everyone  does but he’s adapted to it all from the get-go, he’s just brilliant.“The plan now is that Charlie will remain in brace until June next year and then he will switch to a night time brace for six months at least.  Hopefully he will not have to wear a brace at all eventually.”Following Charlie’s diagnosis and the news that he would have to travel to America for the specialised treatment, the Ballinderry and wider community set about fundraising for the family to help fund their travel, something which the Ferris family are ever grateful for.Donna also has nothing but praise for Shriners Hospital.“Words cannot describe how grateful we are to the hospital for what they have done for us,” she said.“When we first took him to the hospital we knew Charlie was going to be in expert hands as they specialise in infantile scoliosis.“We are so, so grateful to them and it’s very hard to put into words how good they all are.  They don’t just treat Charlie, they treat the whole family.  It’s the same people treating Charlie each and every time and he has become so familiar with them all.“Shriners is a non-profit hospital and they treat families regardless of their ability to pay.  All the time we have been there we have never received a bill from them.  To go half way across the world to another hospital and not be billed is just amazing.”Charlie’s journey over the last  months has been well documented by Donna on a Facebook page named ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’.Through the page, other parents in similar situations have reached out to Donna who has offered them support and advice.  She has also given them ‘hope of what can be achieved’.On November , Donna attended the Families First awards ceremony in Sligo Park Hotel where she was presented with an ‘Inspirational Person’ award – an accolade which she had been nominated for by a parent from Co Cavan.“I spoke to the audience and told them our story and I received a standing ovation afterwards.  I was just overwhelmed by how many people I have touched out there.  It was the perfect end to the perfect week.”Donna now hopes that by speaking out about Charlie’s treatment that it will give other children hope.“The treatment that Charlie received at Shriners Hospital has been available at Great Ormond Street Hospital since July this year however I really want it to become available across the UK and Ireland.“Charlie is living proof of what can be achieved by this gentle, non-invasive treatment so why not offer it to babies here and give them a chance.“I want to be able to help other children in our own country and want parents not to have to feel the need to travel abroad for adequate care.  I would just love to see this treatment available here so there is hope for other families.”To follow Charlie’s progress visit ‘Charlie’s Journey with Infantile Scoliosis’ on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"people derry urged think twice visiting emergency department winter

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When David Davis was leading these negotiations he rolled over and accepted the EU’s agenda for talks - that the money, citizens’ rights and UK - Republic of Ireland border issues had to be settled before the future relationship could be agreed.“This has now led us to a situation whereby all the EU’s key demands could soon be agreed in a legally binding international treaty. By contrast, UK asks by and large are in the political declaration which has no legal basis, and can only be agreed once we have left the EU and lost any leverage we currently have.”The second mistake came, he said, with the infamous agreement on the backstop that was pulled together in December . “The DUP boasted that it had eliminated the possibility of an Irish Sea border. The EU took another view, and we can see very clearly today who won that argument.”Meanwhile, a UUP delegation led by Justice Spokesman Doug Beattie MC MLA, and including Steve Aiken MLA and John Stewart MLA, has met with the Attorney General John Larkin QC, to discuss a range of Brexit issues.Following the meeting Doug Beattie MC MLA said: “It is clear thatthis Agreement does come into being, Northern Ireland will remain subject to the European Court of Justice . In fact, with matters that are in the jurisdiction of the ECJ, they will retain primacy in Northern Ireland while this would not be the case in the rest of the United Kingdom. They will also have an interpretive role in respect to the protocols of the agreement that cannot be challenged. This hardly tallies with the Prime Minister’s claim that we are taking back control of our own laws.”“If we ever do get an Assembly re-established here, its legislative role will be extremely limited, because it will have to adopt EU laws without question or having any ability to revise or amend.” Steve Aiken OBE MLA said:“As a party we have been engaging with the widest range of business leaders and business groups, and now with the Attorney General, to get some sense of the implications that the activation of the protocol would have. It is obvious that the Assembly –it ever comes back – would have a much diminished role. This would increasingly look like joint authority between the EU and the UK.”‘Door shut’ for Troubles victims after Freedom of Information answers haltedMay: Brussels will not offer us a better Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar.
