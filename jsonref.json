Families split and you get on with your life.\u0027 When told that sounded cold, the actor replied \u0027Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E73ED00000578-5771503-image-a-18_1527255437250.jpg","title":"Weinstein hands NYPD biography book Broadway","story":"    Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct with a pile of books under his arm          One of the books is Elia Kazan: A Biography, about the influential film and theater director from the late forties through the sixties          The other was Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0027s Broadway Revolution          The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul seemed carefree as he was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women shortly after 7:30amKazan, who was once one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood, but also had an epic fall from grace during the witch hunt by Sen.

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician. The former junior city banker is the leader of a new far-Right movement in Britain called Generation Identity (GI UK).Unlike the traditional image of the far-Right, epitomised by shaven-headed thugs from groups such as the English Defence League and National Action, Tom Dupre is well-spoken, educated, polite and personable. It makes him more plausible and, ultimately perhaps, more dangerous than the easily-dismissed stereotypes from this end of the political spectrum which we have become accustomed to.The bank holiday getaway heats up!

They’ve been accused of using modern branding and sophisticated coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views.But Dupre insists Generation Identity is neither fascist nor racist, despite the fact that it is campaigning to preserve ‘our ethnocultural identity’ against what it describes as the ‘great replacement’ of white people in Britain’s cities with black and minority ethnic people.    The group, which includes Benjamin Jones, pictured, has been dubbed \u0027Hipster Fascists\u0027The rhetoric echoes Powell’s infamous speech, in which he recounted a conversation he’d had with a middle-aged constituent who had voiced his fear that ‘in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.The words, spoken 50 years apart, might be different, but the message delivered by Tom Dupre and Enoch Powell is the same.Posters in Manchester last week reinforced that message, declaring that ‘each new census heralds the end of England and the English. By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London. I was just seven years old when I saw the Twin Towers collapsing on the TV. It did not make sense to me. A lot of people my age feel the same way.’Yet, critics claim that behind the slick branding and expertly produced promotional videos of Generation Identity lies an ugly message of white supremacy and ‘racial separatism’.These young men might look the picture of respectability with their snazzy suits, fashionable labels and super-cool haircuts. Their rhetoric, however, tells a different story.One of Tom Dupre’s big questions during a recent address to a GI convention was: ‘Are we a threat?’ Compared to the bomber jackets and beer bellies of the English Defence League, the answer, quite possibly, is very much, yes.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron and Mark Branagan"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/21/0F6D3BDD00000578-0-image-m-48_1527278632736.jpg","title":"UK backs decision hold Russia legally responsible downing flight MH17","story":"    Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke, pictured, provided evidence of the BUK missile used to shoot down MH17 on July 17, 2014 over eastern Ukraine Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said yesterday: ‘State responsibility comes into play when states fail to uphold provisions of international law and that’s clearly the case.’Australia and the Netherlands quickly gained support from the US, UK and the EU, putting further strain on tense relations between Moscow and the West.The Hipster Fascists: Well-dressed, highly educated and from...Share this articleForeign Secretary Boris Johnson called on Russia to co-operate fully with the investigation, adding: ‘The Kremlin believes it can act with impunity.‘The Russian government must answer for its actions in relation to the downing of MH17.

Asked at an economic forum in Saint Petersburg whether a Russian army missile was used, he said: ‘Of course not.’Mr Putin added Moscow could not fully trust Dutch findings about the incident because Moscow had not been involved in the investigation."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/01/4CA283FA00000578-0-image-m-32_1527292868874.jpg","title":"Aaron Hernandezs former fianc e pregnant baby BOXER bar owner","story":"    Aaron Hernandez\u0027s former fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, is expecting a baby girl in June with a new man just one year after his death  Her love interest has been identified as boxer and bar owner, Dino Guilmette, 39, pictured here\u0027I\u0027m going to have my hands full but I\u0027m happy about it,\u0027 Guilmette said.\u0027I\u0027m excited.

As we continue to make using a handheld mobile behind the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we would hope to see an even bigger reduction in those going to court throughout 2018.’He added: ‘You are twice as likely to crash while text-driving as drink-driving, so the best way for drivers to avoid picking up their phone is to turn the phone off before their journey and convert their glove box into a phone box.’Despite the figures being hailed as a success, there are concerns that the fall in convictions could also be due to fewer people being caught after a drop in the number of frontline traffic police officers. The number of road police officers fell by nearly a third between 2007 and 2017, from 3,766 to 2,643.          The Mail has a long-running campaign to target motorists using their mobile phones while behind the wheel of their carsA poll of 19,500 drivers carried out by the AA found two-thirds of motorists think they can get away with careless driving due to a lack of police on the roads.The official figures also revealed a drop in convictions for speeding, drink-driving and failing to stop or provide information after a crash.Despite a rise in car thefts, the number of people convicted of the crime fell more than 10 per cent last year to 4,441.Speeding accounted for just over half (51 per cent) of the 664,000 drivers prosecuted for motoring offences last year.The number of prosecutions for causing death or injury by dangerous driving hit 900, the highest level in a decade.Steve Double, a Tory member of the Commons transport committee, said: ‘I’ve been out with the police and it’s clear they take a hard line on anyone they see using their phone while driving.‘These figures are encouraging.

One day last week, 48 per cent of students were out, she said.School officials have been monitoring air quality. Students were kept inside Wednesday morning, when sulfur dioxide emissions were high.Officials have handed out ash-filtering masks, though they keep running out because some kids misplace them.

aides in a meeting room in the border village and a detailed account of their discussions will be announced on Sunday, according to the South Korean government          This is the second time in a month they have met to discuss peace commitmentsThe meeting at a border truce village came hours after South Korea expressed relief over revived talks for a summit between President Trump and Mr Kim.This was following a whirlwind 24 hours that saw the US leader cancel the highly anticipated meeting, before saying it is potentially back on. Trump later tweeted that the summit, if it does happen, will likely take place on June 12 in Singapore as originally planned. In their first summit in April, Kim and Moon announced vague aspirations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and permanent peace, which Seoul has tried to sell as a meaningful breakthrough to set up the summit with Trump.Driver of white Lamborghini loses control and crashes into a...Heart-stopping moment elderly couple

Washington and Pyongyang, was caught off guard by Trump\u0027s abrupt cancellation of the summit in which he cited hostility in recent North Korean comments.Moon said Trump\u0027s decision left him

which Seoul has tried to sell as a meaningful breakthrough to set up the summit with TrumpTrump\u0027s back-and-forth over his summit plans with Kim has exposed the fragility of Seoul as an intermediary.It fanned fears in South Korea that the country may lose its voice between a rival intent on driving a wedge between Washington and Seoul and an American president who thinks less of the traditional alliance with Seoul than his predecessors.Trump\u0027s decision to pull out of the summit with Kim came just days after he hosted Moon in a White House meeting where he openly cast doubts on the Singapore meeting but offered no support for continued inter-Korean progress, essentially ignoring the North\u0027s recent attempts to coerce the South.In his letter to Kim, Trump objected specifically to a statement from senior North Korean diplomat Choe Son Hui.She referred to Vice President Mike Pence as a \u0027political dummy\u0027 for his earlier comments on North Korea and said it was up to the Americans whether they would \u0027meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown.\u0027North Korea issued an unusually restrained and diplomatic response to Trump, saying it\u0027s still willing to sit for talks with the United States \u0027at any time, (in) any format.\u0027          Trump\u0027s back-and-forth over his summit plans with Kim has exposed the fragility of Seoul as an intermediary\u0027The first meeting would not solve all, but solving even one at a time in a phased way would make the relations get better rather than making them get worse,\u0027 North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement carried by Pyongyang\u0027s official Korean Central News Agency, which mainly targets external audience.Analysts say Kim\u0027s diplomatic outreach in recent months after a flurry of nuclear and missile tests in 2017 indicates he is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and the international legitimacy the summit with Trump would provide.But there\u0027s also skepticism whether Kim will ever agree to fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he likely sees as his only guarantee of survival.Comments in North Korea\u0027s state media indicate Kim sees any meeting with Trump as an arms control negotiation between nuclear states, rather than a process to surrender his nukes.The North has said it will refuse to participate in talks where it would be unilaterally pressured to give up its nukes."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/19/4C97DEAA00000578-0-image-m-11_1527186555731.jpg","title":"Ros shortage increase demand worldwide Britons paying wine summer","story":"

Butina is pictured at the 2015 NRA convention. Senate Democrats say they have proof Russians were funneling money through the NRA to support Trump\u0027s campaign However, the FBI\u0027s interest in the calls may be sign of suspicion over what money, if any, Torshin or any other Russian gave the NRA in the run-up to Trump\u0027s campaign. It has been claimed by Senate Democrats that he funneled money into the NRA and in turn bolstered Trump\u0027s campaign. The NRA has insisted that Torshin only ever paid his membership fees but admitted previously to taking roughly $2,500 in contributions from Russian-linked contributors. Torshin is on a list of oligarchs who have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department. In banning him, they said it was proven that he had been trying to influence the American political system for years, since long before Trump announced his campaign, and that he was trying to act on Putin\u0027s behalf to push his agenda.  Spanish police have long been trying to snare him and came close to it in 2013 when they planned to arrest him at a party thrown by Romanov on the island of Mallorca. He never showed up and has evaded them ever since. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/13/4CA5512B00000578-5774429-image-m-18_1527337495604.jpg","title":"Radio 2 listeners revolt new drivetime format","story":"    Radio 2 producers are facing a revolt over Jo Whiley joining Simon Mayo (pictured together at Radio 2 Live in September 2016) for the drivetime show          One inidual said \u0027you cannot ignore us, we will not go away\u0027 over the change          Another said: \u0027This doesn\u0027t do it for me and I\u0027ve given it enough of a chance - I\u0027m off to find something entertaining\u0027\u0027When is this going to happen?

Given how light the girls\u0027 hair is, the colour appeared to \u0027take\u0027 quickly leaving Mylie with blush-tinted cascading curls\u0027I got them straight in the shower and even tried washing-up liquid which helps fade colour faster but all of Mylie\u0027s blonde curls had turned pink.\u0027I had to take her to pre-school yesterday and explain to all the teachers what had happened - they burst out laughing.\u0027Kylie said she thought the hair dye was safely out of reach and would be impossible to get into while she was out of the room.Kylie said: \u0027The hair dye bottles aren\u0027t easy to get into but earlier in the day I had the lids off to check the colours.\u0027I mustn\u0027t have put that one back on properly after getting distracted when Stevie started crying and needed feeding.\u0027I\u0027d also put the bottles high up on the side in the kitchen and didn\u0027t think they\u0027d be able to get to them, but how wrong was I?  Pictured: The Bleach London hair dye (left) that the pair got hold of and (right) the two sisters\u0027When I looked at the scene of the crime afterwards I saw she\u0027d used her potty to climb up to the counter and reach the bottle.\u0027The colour, advertised as fading within two to ten washes, shows no sign of going anywhere just yet, however Kylie is satisfied it will come out within the week. A Bleach London spokesman said: \u0027As stated on our packaging, we warn very clearly to keep product out of reach of children.\u0027We are glad to see that on this occasion no harm has been caused.\u0027Our products are gentle, vegan, and will wash out over the stated time, giving people creative license with their hair, with much less of the commitment.

Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/08/4CA15C8200000578-5771809-image-m-26_1527320873160.jpg","title":"Pensioner battling council EIGHT YEARS flowers","story":"    Thelma Peppert has lived in Rose Cottage in the village of Dalton Piercy, near Hartlepool, since 1967          Pictured: Rose Cottage in 1967, the year Mrs Peppert moved in to the country home          Since moving into the listed building, Mrs Peppert (pictured) has tended a flower border by her front wallEight years on and a petition has now been launched after the council sent a letter to 92-year-old Mrs Peppert requesting that she remove it - or they will.Mrs Peppert\u0027s son John Proudlock, who lives with his disabled mother and is her full-time carer, said the letter from the council left her physically sick.Lady Gaga shows off her ample cleavage in skimpy red dress...\u0027The English clubs were ahead of the rest of Europe... our...\u0027Doomed\u0027 northern white rhino CAN be resurrected: Frozen...Share this article\u0027My mother is housebound and in deteriorating health, the house and flowers have been her pride and joy for 50 years,\u0027 he said.\u0027The threat of the needless destruction of such a pretty flower border is causing her huge distress and anxiety.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician.

By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London. I was just seven years old when I saw the Twin Towers collapsing on the TV. It did not make sense to me. A lot of people my age feel the same way.’Yet, critics claim that behind the slick branding and expertly produced promotional videos of Generation Identity lies an ugly message of white supremacy and ‘racial separatism’.These young men might look the picture of respectability with their snazzy suits, fashionable labels and super-cool haircuts. Their rhetoric, however, tells a different story.One of Tom Dupre’s big questions during a recent address to a GI convention was: ‘Are we a threat?’ Compared to the bomber jackets and beer bellies of the English Defence League, the answer, quite possibly, is very much, yes.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron and Mark Branagan"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/01/4CA283FA00000578-0-image-m-32_1527292868874.jpg","title":"Aaron Hernandezs former fianc e pregnant baby BOXER bar owner","story":"    Aaron Hernandez\u0027s former fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, is expecting a baby girl in June with a new man just one year after his death  Her love interest has been identified as boxer and bar owner, Dino Guilmette, 39, pictured here\u0027I\u0027m going to have my hands full but I\u0027m happy about it,\u0027 Guilmette said.\u0027I\u0027m excited.

Those caught using their mobile twice or accruing 12 points on their licence face being disqualified and fines of up to £1,000.Jack Cousens, of the AA, said: ‘Campaigns by both the AA and the Mail have clearly contributed towards the reduction of people being presented at court for using a handheld mobile phone behind the wheel, which has dropped by more than a quarter. As we continue to make using a handheld mobile behind the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we would hope to see an even bigger reduction in those going to court throughout 2018.’He added: ‘You are twice as likely to crash while text-driving as drink-driving, so the best way for drivers to avoid picking up their phone is to turn the phone off before their journey and convert their glove box into a phone box.’Despite the figures being hailed as a success, there are concerns that the fall in convictions could also be due to fewer people being caught after a drop in the number of frontline traffic police officers. The number of road police officers fell by nearly a third between 2007 and 2017, from 3,766 to 2,643.          The Mail has a long-running campaign to target motorists using their mobile phones while behind the wheel of their carsA poll of 19,500 drivers carried out by the AA found two-thirds of motorists think they can get away with careless driving due to a lack of police on the roads.The official figures also revealed a drop in convictions for speeding, drink-driving and failing to stop or provide information after a crash.Despite a rise in car thefts, the number of people convicted of the crime fell more than 10 per cent last year to 4,441.Speeding accounted for just over half (51 per cent) of the 664,000 drivers prosecuted for motoring offences last year.The number of prosecutions for causing death or injury by dangerous driving hit 900, the highest level in a decade.Steve Double, a Tory member of the Commons transport committee, said: ‘I’ve been out with the police and it’s clear they take a hard line on anyone they see using their phone while driving.‘These figures are encouraging.

One day last week, 48 per cent of students were out, she said.School officials have been monitoring air quality. Students were kept inside Wednesday morning, when sulfur dioxide emissions were high.Officials have handed out ash-filtering masks, though they keep running out because some kids misplace them.

Volcanic ash covers coffee plants at the Ka\u0027u Coffee Mill in Pahala, Hawaii, U.S., May 25, 2018. An eruption Thursday night sent an ash cloud about 10,000 feet into the air. Neal said she didn\u0027t notice much more ash after that, likely because the winds had died down.The National Weather Service said it expects trade winds to slow this weekend, creating hazardous air quality. Volcanic gases, pollution and ash could increase along with sulfur dioxide levels downwind of lava fissures.Volcanic ash is the reason the area has such rich soil for crops, such as coffee, Akamu said. \u0027We\u0027re not complaining about the ash.

Why has it taken so long for the remarkable story of Oluale Kossola to be made public?“We stand as living monuments,” wrote the historian Len Garrison, of the black British descendants of slavery and empire. “For those who are afraid of who they must be, are but slaves in a trance.” For Garrison, the idea of the African diaspora as “living monuments” was to some extent figurative. But a new book makes it literal. Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave presents the remarkable fact that there were people alive in America who had experienced abduction from Africa – being examined, displayed, traded and enslaved – well into the 20th century.The book is the story of Cudjo Lewis a man born Oluale Kossola in the Yoruba kingdom of Takkoi. Kossola was the last survivor of the last known slave ship to sail from the African continent to America with a human cargo. Written in the 1930s, but hidden away from a public audience until now, it is also perhaps the last great, unpublished work by the Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston.The word “barracoon” refers to the enclosures in which captives were held on the coast before being loaded on to ships. In Kossola’s case it was the Alabama vessel the Clotilda, which played its own gruesome part in the slave trade in 1860, half a century after its official abolition, transporting 130 men and women from the west African kingdom of Dahomey – modern day Benin.By 1931, when Hurston interviewed Kossola – sweetening him with peaches, Virginia hams and late summer melons –, he was around 90 years old, and yet able, over a period of three months, to recall his life in Takkoi in great detail his grandfather, an officer of the king his mother and siblings law and justice love and adolescence. He spoke in heartbreaking detail of watching his community annihilated during a raid by Dahomey’s female warriors, leading to his capture and enslavement, the torture of the “middle passage”, and life in 19th and 20th century Alabama. Through all these years – many more lived in America than he had spent in his African birth nation – he never let go of the unspeakable loss of his homeland. When Hurston takes his photograph, Kossola dresses in his best suit, but removes his shoes, telling her: “I want to look lak I in Affica, ’cause dat where I want to be.”The uniqueness of the story and that of the writer who tells it are layered and intertwined. The old, poetic Kossola, generous with his parables and storytelling, is one of almost four million Africans enslaved late in the history of the transatlantic trade. And while the full history is documented in countless accounts of slave traders, merchants, plantation owners and masters, ledgers and auction records and court documents, the number of first-hand accounts of Africans forced to become Americans can be counted on two hands. It is Hurston, and perhaps Hurston alone, who could have drawn this heavy tale out of the often melancholy old man, and have the vision and skill to make it sing, in the way that Barracoon does, for reasons rooted deeply in her own life story.Hurston was born in 1891 in Eatonville, Florida, a small town with an entirely black population, which she would later describe as “the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools and no jailhouse”. She would keep close links to her hometown, despite leaving when she was just 13, and then drifting – working as a manicurist and achieving a degree part time at Howard University – until she arrived in New York in 1925. By then she was in her mid 30s (but convinced those whom she met that she was a full decade younger) and had – as she wrote later in her autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road – “$1.50, no job, no friends, and a lot of hope”.Hurston began studying anthropology at Barnard College and, having received a fellowship to gather material in her home state, set about documenting African American folk traditions in towns like Eatonville, and later in the southern states, the Bahamas and Haiti. It was during this period, right at the beginning of her career, that she first met Kossola, interviewing him several times in the late 1920s. It was her first major project, but also her first major failure. An article she published about Kossola in the Journal of Negro History would be accused of plagiarism, allegations which scholars now contest, and which in any event drove Hurston to return to Alabama, to conduct the series of interviews that would form the core of Barracoon, and, this time, to do so in a manner that would cast the work beyond any doubt.Around this time, black art began asserting itself brazenly in an America still emerging from four centuries of slavery and legalised white supremacy, and the belief that the African had no civilisation to offer. By the time of her death in 1960, Hurston would have published more books than any other black woman in America. But it wasn’t until she caught the attention of sociologist Charles S Johnson, champion of the Harlem Renaissance and the editor of Opportunity, the official journal of the National Urban League (which published her work as well as that of Claude McKay, Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen), that she got her break.Even within the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston’s approach was radical. Inspired by her Eatonville roots, she was instinctively compelled by the folklore, the idioms, customs, worksongs, spirituals, sermons, children’s games, folktales and practices of African American communities of the south. While other members of the black intelligentsia were celebrating racial uplift, and while hundreds of thousands fled the rural south in the “great migration”, in search of what they imagined to be progress in northern cities, Hurston was interested in “the Negro farthest down”. Her goal as an author, anthropologist and essayist, was – the scholar Karla Holloway has said – “to render the oral culture literate”.“The unlettered Negro,” Hurston wrote, was “the Negro’s best contribution to American culture.” It was this belief which inspired Barracoon – a book in which there is little of Hurston herself, but plenty of her ideology, in capturing Kossola, a man whose culture slavery both created and destroyed. Like the language of some of Hurston’s later works – Mule Bone, the play she would write with Hughes in 1931 Mules and Men, a compilation of oral folklore in 1935 and her most famous work, the novel Their Eyes Were Watching God in 1937 – Kossola’s narrative plays the music of history itself within its tonalities, rhythms and inflections. But the narrative, like Kossola, stands apart from Hurston’s others his speech is more a recognisably African Creole than the African American vernacular, and despite all his decades living in America, Kossola is steeped in the thought of Africa, the world – as he calls it – “in de Affica soil”. Hurston’s fidelity to the manner and content of Kossola’s storytelling is the book’s strength. Yet within it were also contained the seeds of Barracoon’s downfall. When Hurston took the manuscript to publishers, they wanted her to anglicise his English, which she resolutely refused to do.“Hurston was not interested in, as Toni Morrison might put it, the white gaze, and how ‘they’ would perceive us,” explains Deborah Plant, a Hurston scholar who edited Barracoon. “She was interested in what was specific in African American culture, those aspects which were rooted in African tradition, African history, African civilisation, because in that authenticity lay the genius – the spirit, as Hurston describes it – that which the soul lives by.”For Cheryl Wall, Zora Neale Hurston professor of English at Rutgers University, “this impatience with Hurston’s determination to transcribe Kossola’s speech faithfully is enormously frustrating”. It was “part of the pattern of Hurston’s life that she had to fight so hard to have her voice heard, and the voices of those whose stories she wanted to tell. We are told the dialect is too difficult. Is it really any more difficult than the dialect of Mark Twain or James Joyce? Yes it requires some extra effort, but it’s the kind of effort we usually put into a literary text without complaint.”The irony is astounding. Kossola, a man denied his home and his voice by American racism, would have the telling of his story silenced too. Barracoon, having been met with intransigence by publishers, remained unpublished, ending up in a private collection that was passed to the archive at Howard University in 1956, where it remained inaccessible to all but a handful of scholars who read it and cited it in their work.Hurston found her own life mirroring this cycle of narration and dispossession. After the success of her work in the 1930s and 40s, her hugely productive career spiralled downwards. She lived hand to mouth, writing articles for magazines while working at odd jobs, including one stint in Miami for an employer who saw her byline in the Saturday Evening Post and tipped off a reporter that the author was her maid. Hurston was humiliated, and spent the next decade in a series of small towns in Florida, plagued by health and money problems, until she ended up in a welfare home where she died, penniless, of heart disease in 1960.At the time of her death, none of her seven previously published books was in print. Neighbours collected money for her funeral and it made front page news in the local black weekly, the Fort Pierce Chronicle. But she was buried in a segregated cemetery, in an unmarked grave.For the novelist and feminist Alice Walker, who in 1973 set out to discover what had become of Hurston, finding this grave in a “field full of weeds” was a devastating experience. “There are times,” wrote Walker, “and finding Zora Hurston’s grave was one of them, when normal responses to grief, horror and so on do not make sense because they bear no real relation to the depth of emotion one feels.” Walker was determined to restore Hurston’s legacy and reputation. She obtained a gravestone, and had it inscribed with the words: “Zora Neale Hurston – A genius of the south. Novelist. Folklorist. Anthropologist.”Their Eyes Were Watching God, still considered Hurston’s greatest work, was soon back in circulation. That edition, by the University of Illinois Press, sold more than 300,000 copies, making it, as Wall says, “one of the most dramatic chapters in African American literary history”.The publication of Barracoon thus represents a recovery within a recovery the works of Hurston having been so dramatically resurrected, but this one languishing in obscurity until now. And its publication comes at an emotive moment in the African American experience – an experience loaded not just with historical trauma, but very contemporary pain. Alice Walker writes, for example, in the foreword to the book, that in reading Kossola’s story, African Americans “are struck with the realisation that he is naming something we ourselves work hard to avoid, how lonely we are too in this still foreign land”.Karla Holloway, professor of English at Duke University, says: “The irony is that the loneliness that echoes through Kossola’s account, and that Walker so poignantly notices, is our collective legacy.“We work hard to escape and slip past that loneliness, but inevitably we are captured, again, by the wake of slavery, a tidal wash as reliable as moonrise.”The era of Black Lives Matter, of harassment in coffee shops, of a president who has been both overtly racist and also dismissive of racism, and of the disappointment at the first black president having been able to make little real change to poverty, criminalisation and exclusion, has produced a moment in which the struggle has never been more apparent, yet the cultural expression of that suffering has never been more visible.“I do think one of the reasons that the book is so attractive right now is that there is this longing for African Americans to have access to a pre-US life – a connection to Africa,” says Autumn Womack, an assistant professor of English and African American studies at Princeton University. “If nothing else, Barracoon announces the desire for this kind of connection, even if it’s never really fulfilled. People are searching for a vocabulary to make sense of that.”That struggle is finding expression in film, TV and theatre that focuses on the experience of slavery from the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, the remake of the memorable series Roots and the multi-award-winning musical Hamilton. It is present in pop culture, with the recent phenomenon of Childish Gambino’s “This Is America”, whose video references the violent brutalisation of African Americans. There are new museums – America’s first of African American history, which opened in 2016 the Whitney Plantation, the first plantation museum on American soil and the nation’s first memorial to the horrors of lynching, in Alabama.It is abundant in literature too Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and other influential books such ass Isabel Wilkerson’s The Warmth of Other Suns, which tells the story of the Great Depression in new and profound detail Stamped from the Beginning, by Ibram X Kendi, which chronicles the life of American racism Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give, radicalising readers of young adult fiction to the injustice of police killings and Jesmyn Ward’s devastating Sing, Unburied, Sing.The pathos of the African American experience, told with such tenderness in Barracoon, is matched by its complexity. Hurston herself remarked that in writing Kossola’s harrowing account of how the king of Dahomey profited from raiding and selling members of neighbouring kingdoms, she was deeply affected by the question of African complicity in the slave trade. “The inescapable fact that stuck in my craw,” Hurston wrote, “was my people had sold me and the white people had bought me. That did away with the folklore I had been brought up on – that white people had gone to Africa, waved a red handkerchief at the Africans and lured them aboard ship and sailed away.”And yet Barracoon also helps deepen the understanding of the context in which slavery took place. “This idea of ‘African complicity’ is more myth than a reality,” Plant says. “Because at that point in history, there was no such thing as an ‘African’. People on the African continent did not self identify as Africans instead there was a self identity in relation to specific ethnic groups and specific kingdoms, religions or language. So many of us don’t know, because we don’t have these nuances about our history.”The absence of stories like Kossola’s has hardly helped bring these nuances to the fore. There are other difficult questions arising from the book about the extent to which the African American victims of slavery internalised the attitudes of their oppressors. Kossola recalls how his children in particular endured bullying from neighbouring African Americans, for having two African-born parents.“All de time de chillun growin’ de American folks dey picks at dem and tell de Afficky people dey kill folks and eatee de meat,” Kossola recounts in Barracoon. “Dey callee my chillun ig’nant savage and make out dey kin to monkey … It hurtee dey feelings.”“Those acculturated African Americans could have been more open, more receptive, compassionate, and they weren’t,” Plant says. “They were a source of hostility to Kossola and his community. We can explain or rationalise it, but it doesn’t justify it.” The book’s uniqueness is in its recounting of a story in which we are all equally bound up by this cycle of oppression – the former slave plagued by the trauma of losing his homeland and family, the writer whose work survived the desire of intellectuals for white approval, the reader forced to challenge their own ideas about race and the internalisation of oppression. But more than anything it brings an African past up close to an African American present, at a time of great searching. “Throughout her life, Hurston fought against this idea that there was no connection to Africa once people arrived on these shores, and everything was forgotten,” Wall says. “We know that’s not true. But a book like this really brings that to life.”• Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave by Zora Neale Hurston is published by HarperCollins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a85c6ca239c4338c17ab3c4bceac5ecf66b719/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a848136fe6a3da82e285fbe13115f76","title":"ariana grande brings dignified note to twitter spat manchester bombing","story":"Ariana Grande commemorated the one-year anniversary of the horrific Manchester Arena attacks with heart, warmth and grace. She offered a message of love to survivors on Twitter her mother posted a picture of a candlelit vigil held at their family home, with 22 candles, one for each of the fans who died. On Friday, the singer tweeted a picture of a new tattoo, a bee behind her ear, accompanied by the word “forever”. It must be an unimaginably tough time for Grande. She is still only 24 and her dignity continues to astonish.In the background, Grande has also managed to pull off the rare feat of making social media seem like a mature forum in which decency and empathy can thrive.Rather than ignoring a Twitter user with a few hundred followers, who posted a comment that went viral suggesting Grande’s breakup with her ex, Mac Miller, was “heartbreaking” because he’d just released a 10-song album about her, she responded with a quietly furious reply: “How absurd that you minimise female self-respect and self-worth by saying someone should stay in a toxic relationship because he wrote an album about them, which by the way isn’t the case,” she began. She went on to state that she wasn’t “a babysitter or a mother… shamingblaming women for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem”.In a sea of gossipy and inconsequential celebrity noise, it\u0026nbspwas a punch-the-air moment. It’s\u0026nbspnot often that famous people who are scrutinised to such a level get to take control of their own stories, but here Grande was, telling\u0026nbspher own life as it is, in no uncertain terms.I couldn’t help but feel sorry for the original tweeter, though, who clearly had no idea that his comment would take on the life that it did. He responded with a sincere apology it seemed as if everyone learned from the discussion and left it in a polite and understanding place. Usually, Twitter furores involve people typing the same angry point at each\u0026nbspother in all-caps repeatedly with a cumulative use of frantic swearing until one of them gets tired and gives up, so to see it resolved so harmoniously was a pleasant revelation.If she’s fixing the internet, then perhaps there’s nothing Ariana Grande can’t do. Marvel doesn’t really need any more superheroes – the very idea of Avengers: Infinity War has overwhelmed me to the point of inertia – but it might be worth putting Grande forward as a potential addition to the roster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f787dc48daa8313b0b51c85d01b3693d91ca1a60/0_9_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7628f2064d84054a6e18e8a7ea11048e","title":"britain politeness english speakers gratitude","story":"Research shows that English speakers are rather keen on saying thank you. But are we really expressing our gratitude?In 2015, Simeon Floyd, then of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, gave a lecture in Antwerp about expressions of gratitude in eight cultures around the world. I was lucky enough to be there, and have been thinking ever since about the videos he showed. In one, a Cha’palaa speaker in Ecuador goes to a hole-in-the-wall shop and asks for some cooking oil. Receiving it, he turns away and leaves. In another, a British student eyes up another’s biscuits and asks for one. As he reaches into the proffered packet, he smiles and says, “Sweet!”This week, Royal Society Open Science published Floyd and his colleagues’ work, and caused a flutter. The Times headlined its piece “Britons really do say ‘thank you’ more than anyone else”. The Independent referred to Britain’s famed “unrelenting penchant for\u0026nbsppoliteness”.If Britain is famed anywhere for “unrelenting politeness”, it is nowhere more so than in Britain itself, where the national reputation for good manners is treated as a badge of honour. While there’s plenty of British self-deprecation in the use of words like “please”, “thank you” and “sorry”, it comes with some implicit self-congratulation: we use these words because we’re so polite, the reasoning goes. The unspoken assumption is that others are less so.Some humility (not the same as self-deprecation or politeness) might be in order here, since the research does not show that the British thank “more than anyone else”, but that they thank more (in certain situations) than seven other cultures. Whether British English speakers thank more than people in China, Japan, India or the Middle East is yet unknown – and whether the British thank more than other English speakers is yet another matter. Research for the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, for instance, found that Americans say “thanks” or “thank you” twice as much in conversation as Britons, while Britons say “please” twice as much as Americans.That doesn’t mean Britons make politer requests or that Americans are more grateful. It means that we’ve acquired different habits. With Rachele De Felice of University College London, I’ve been trying to dig down into those numbers. If “thank you” is used at different rates in two cultures, it probably means different things to those cultures. Indeed, in our studies of British and American email correspondence, we’ve found that Britons are more apt to begin emails with thanks for the previous message, while Americans are more likely to thank people for their time or interest. We’ve also found that the lesser American use of “please” is offset by more expressions of appreciation in making requests.British “thanks” comes into its own at the shop till. I was inducted into this thanking culture in the early 2000s, when I was a fresh immigrant from the US, and volunteered in a Brighton charity shop. There, to my surprise, I learned that English shop assistants and patrons can begin an interaction with “thank you” the customer who places a box of Christmas cards in front of the shop assistant can use “thank you” to indicate that they are ready to start a transaction. The assistant may then say “thank you” as they take the item to ring up. Before the end of the interaction, what with the back-and-forth of credit cards or cash, pin machines or change, receipts and bagged goods, there may well be half a dozen more thanks. Do these thanks show gratitude? An alternative reading (made in the 1970s by sociolinguist Dell Hymes) is that the British “thank you” sometimes means “I am asking you to take the next turn in this interaction” or “I am accepting that it is my turn to do something in this interaction”.When we visit other cultures that don’t use thanking to manage their interactions in the same way, it can feel off-putting. But to conclude from ample “thanks”-giving that “we’re more polite” is only to conclude that “we do the things we consider polite more often than other cultures do the things we consider polite”. Hardly a surprising finding.The prevalence of thanks in English-speaking cultures doesn’t show we care more about others and the impositions we make on them. It may instead be a side-effect of our culture’s inidualism. I have to thank you because I cannot assume that we’re close enough for you to naturally be generous towards me. In a more intimate situation or collectivist culture, expressing “thanks” can imply “I\u0026nbsphadn’t trusted that I could count on you for that.”Anyway, thanks for reading.• Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love-Hate Relationship between British and American English"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e922f7665467b27f7da168ff5e1b321069ea81ae/0_162_3520_2112/master/3520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=518e1aa46c3fa2f72e12770a4db478e3","title":"jeremy corbyn prime minister eu brexit october general election","story":"Unhappy Brexiteers could yet force an October general election, and open the way for the Labour leader to reshape BrexitThe idea that the British people are on the brink of “liberation” from the European Union is starting to look very odd indeed. The evidence increasingly suggests that by the middle of the next decade, we may very well still be fully bound by most of the key terms and conditions of EU membership.Yet while we may be obliged to accept EU laws and regulations affecting the single market and the customs union and still have to pay into the EU budget, the British people may notice one difference: we will have neither voice nor vote in determining European laws and regulations. We will be law-takers, not lawmakers.There is likely to be another serious inconvenience to doctrinaire Eurosceptics: the UK may not be able to actually implement any of the promised “amazing trade deals” with the rest of the world until the mid-2020s. In the meantime, it should be noted, Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand are indeed already busy finalising or negotiating some amazing new trade deals. But these are with the EU, not the UK.Legally, we are on course to leave the EU next March that’s when the period allowed under article 50 for negotiating the principles of a new relationship with the EU expires. We then have a further short period, until the end of 2020, to finalise a new, full-scale trade and cooperation treaty with Europe.The trouble is that – outside the May cabinet – no one any longer really believes in this sort of timetable. It is conceivable, but improbable, that the article 50 deadline could be extended by a very short period, but there will be serious legal problems to face. What is more likely is that the subsequent transition (or implementation period), during which the substance of a new treaty would have to be agreed, could be extended.UK customs experts have joined British business and industrial leaders in saying significantly more time will be needed before the UK would be anything like prepared for life outside the customs union and single market. Hence discussion of further proposed deadlines, ranging from the end of 2022 to around 2025.Two major political events in the UK could upend this kind of extended period of grace. The first is the possible collapse of the May government. This may not transpire, but no one can ignore the ever louder drumbeat from hardline Brexiteers that an October general election cannot be ruled out.What is beyond question is that it is a constitutional obligation for the next general election to be held no later than early summer 2022. Even at that stage, the UK may still be in a state of limbo in relation to the EU – bound by obligations, but deprived of democratic rights.In the event of an election this autumn, the focus would increasingly shift from how May can survive and complete the Brexit process to how a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would handle the Brexit process if elected. Indeed, in the event of an October election, he would have to make it clear how he would handle future talks with Brussels.He may state unambiguously that he wishes to reopen negotiations with Michel Barnier, the European council, and indeed the European parliament, at the earliest possible date. He could signal that a Labour government would approach these talks in a very different manner – and say that Labour wants to commit to the standards set by the EU in areas such as workers’ rights and social standards. Corbyn might also express readiness to back further strengthening of EU-wide environmental standards and democratic rights.In particular, as prime minister, there’s a good chance that Corbyn would support some of the reforms now promised by the European commission – notably the planned new European Labour Authority. More specifically, the mooted reforms of the posted workers directive – to close loopholes in free movement exploited by rogue employers to undermine local wages and labour conditions – would be attractive to Corbyn. As a Labour prime minister who pledged to end austerity and gross inequality, his government will have every interest in cooperating as closely as possible in a Europe-wide strategy for faster growth and job generation.For its part, the EU would have every interest in giving an incoming Labour government time to talk through these issues with Brussels – and perhaps an opportunity to put the results to parliament or the people for approval through a referendum.It is worth remembering that, before the 1975 EU referendum, Harold Wilson opposed the terms of the agreement which had been negotiated by Edward Heath’s Tory government. The resulting so-called “renegotiated agreement” was then endorsed in that referendum. A Corbyn “reform and remain” agreement would give voters a constructive alternative to being in the EU only for obligations, and out in terms of democracy and law-making rights.• John Palmer is a former European editor of the  and former political director of the European Policy Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2d6f47d0b911c8dfaa6e4aaf7f967a8d281eaea/0_0_750_450/master/750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8040748b88eebc75db52dc6e97468628","title":"us school funding what its like work oklahoma teacher","story":"An Oklahoma teacher’s account of her school district, from the classrooms without desks and supplies to the professors who hold office hours in their carsIn my Oklahoma high school classroom, it is not easy to tell where federal funding ends and state funding begins – in fact, most teachers don’t have a clue about where our funding comes from. But what is abundantly clear is that our schools need more funding.Unless you are in a school every day, you might not see the results of underfunding education. That is because we open our doors no matter what, and my colleagues and I will do everything we can to make sure our students get the education they deserve. But just because the consequences are invisible doesn’t mean there isn’t a problem. Isn’t that the definition of privilege? Thinking something isn’t a problem simply because it might not be a problem for you?You have probably heard about the recent teacher walkout in Oklahoma. While some of that was about teacher salaries, it was more about the conditions in our schools – conditions that resulted from years of underfunding education.Our school system also has 58 classrooms that are “split-level”. This means a teacher is required to teach two different curricula to two different grade levels at the same time in the same classroom. And our teachers do this without the help of a teaching assistant.I am a proud general at US Grant high school. We have the best administrators, the most dedicated teachers and amazing students. But we are struggling. Our building is only 10 years old, but it was built for 1,200 people. We currently have 2,000 students and 160 staff members.Our classes are extremely overcrowded, with 30 and 40 students per class. Some of us don’t even have enough desks for our students to sit in. Coach Aaron McVay, one of our PE teachers, has had classes of more than 80 students. How much learning happens in a class of 80?Some teachers don’t even have classrooms. They keep their belongings, textbooks and supplies on carts and push them from classroom to classroom, hour to hour. I have been a traveling teacher. Like some of our fellow union members who are adjunct college professors and hold “office hours” in their cars and nurses who travel from school to school, fingers crossed, hoping no one at a school across town will suffer a health crisis, it is almost impossible to be an effective educator while carting your work around.None of the teachers I asked could remember the last time we adopted new textbooks. Our current history textbook, The Story of Oklahoma, is so old that the Oklahoma City bombing only gets a couple of pages in the epilogue.It’s OK, though. We only have about 60 copies for our 600-plus freshmen, so the teachers have to create their own resource packets anyway. During the walkout, when photos of our beat-up and duct-taped textbooks started appearing in the media, one student told us: “I didn’t realize that people had textbooks with covers on them.”The cut that hurt most was losing our two maintenance workers, Gerald and Joe, whose positions were eliminated when our district was forced to cut the first $30m in 2017. Gerald and Joe kept our building running. Without them, nothing seems to work. Last August, we had days without air conditioning. It was common for my classroom to reach 90 degrees by 9am. In fact, Cristina Moershel taught her class outside because it was cooler there than in her classroom. Outside. In August. In Oklahoma. She used a dry erase marker on the window to teach calculus while her students sat on the ground.Now, think about how much these problems would be exacerbated if some of this year’s proposed cuts to federal funding were to go through.Cuts would make it impossible to retain qualified teachers instead of losing them at the rate of almost 400 per month. If there are cuts to federal programs for low-income students or students with disabilities, what else will my school have to sacrifice to provide the services they need? How will these cuts help students graduate and take on the world?Yes, teachers will continue to work miracles with the few resources we’re given and the huge obstacles in our path. But imagine the improvements for students that could result from additional education funding. Up to date textbooks. Professional development for teachers and support staff to help us improve instruction. Air conditioning. Smaller classes so every student can get more personalized attention – and maybe a desk for them to sit in.In their latest appropriations bill, our representatives in Congress did move in the right direction by providing an increase to federal education programs. Even so, it hasn’t made up for years of underfunding, particularly in special education services and Title I programs for children in poverty. I’m here to tell you that those decisions do make a difference for our students. I urge Congress to build on last year’s good start, reject spending cuts to education and provide much more funding for our schools.Melissa Smith is the criminal justice teacher, student council adviser, senior class sponsor and Link Crew coordinator at US Grant high school in Oklahoma City, and a member of the Oklahoma City AFT.Looking for more perspectives from AFT Voices, the blog featuring writing about schools, teaching and education from American Federation of Teachers members?

He talks masculinity, fame – and why he’s finally ready to play LearFor anyone who looks toward their later years with trepidation, Sir Anthony Hopkins (“Tony, please”) is a proper tonic. He is 79, and happier than he has ever been. This is due to a mixture of things: his relationship with his wife of 15 years, Stella, who has encouraged him to keep fit, and to branch out into painting and classical composition the calming of his inner fire, of which more later and his work.Hopkins loves to work. Much of his self-esteem and vigour comes from acting – “Oh, yes, work has kept me going. Work has given me my energy” – and he is in no way contemplating slowing down. You can feel a quicksilver energy about him, a restlessness. Every so often, I think he’s going to stop the interview and take flight, but actually he’s enjoying himself and keeps saying, “Ask me more! This is great!”We meet in Rome, where he is making a Netflix film about the relationship between the last pope (Benedict) and the current one (Francis). Hopkins is playing Benedict, Jonathan Pryce is Francis. He is enjoying this – “We’re filming in the Sistine Chapel tomorrow!” – and we are both relishing the lovely view across the city from the penthouse suite in the hotel where he’s staying. Still, he declares that the film we are here to talk about, the BBC’s King Lear, filmed in England and directed by Richard Eyre, is the piece of work that has made him truly happy. “I felt, ‘Yes, I can do this.’ I can do this sort of work. I didn’t walk away. And it’s so invigorating, because I know I can do it, and I’ve got my sense of humour, my humility, and nothing’s been destroyed.”He’s played the part before, at the National Theatre in 1986, with David Hare directing. “I was… ” – he counts in his head “… 48,” he says. “Ridiculous. I didn’t realise I was too young. I had no concept of how to do it. I was floundering.”Now, he feels he’s got Lear right, and few would disagree. In a star-studded cast – Emma Thompson plays Goneril Emily Watson, Regan Jim Broadbent, Gloucester Jim Carter, Kent Andrew Scott, Edgar – it’s Hopkins who dominates. He is fantastic: his white hair close-cropped, his manner like a heavy-headed bull, a scary tyrant losing his powers, a drinker who flips into terrifying rage.Hopkins’ theory is that Lear’s wife died giving birth to Cordelia, and Lear brought her up, his favourite, as a tomboy. Of the older two daughters, Emily Watson said, “and I agree with her, that they have become monsters, because he made them so”. Hopkins believes that Lear is terrified of women, can’t understand them. Hence the awful specificity of the curses he rains on his older daughters, damning their wombs. He seeks refuge in men, surrounding himself with a boisterous male army. The scenes where Lear wants to bring his retinue to Regan’s house are reminiscent of an awful, all-boys-together drink-fest.“I come from a generation where men were men,” Hopkins says. “There’s nothing soft or touchy-feely about any of us, where we were from in Wales. There’s a negative side to that, because we’re not very good at receiving love or giving it. We don’t understand it. After Richard Burton died, his brother Graham invited me to the Dorchester where they were all having a get-together, the wives and the men, all the sisters and brothers. All pissed. And I noticed the women were sipping their ports and brandy, but all the men were, ‘Come on, drink! Drink!’ I thought, ‘There’s something very Greek about this.’ Men together. You know, like the bouzouki dancers. It’s not homosexuality, but it is a sexuality, a kind of bonding. That’s what I was thinking of.”Hopkins often uses his past to find his way into a character. Small incidents that stick in his mind, real people who inform. In the scene with Kent, Edgar and the Fool, as Lear descends into madness, he has all three line up on a bench and addresses them with the wrong names. Hopkins decided that Lear had seen his father drown three puppies when he was young and believed his friends to be those dogs. “Cruelty to an animal stays with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “I once witnessed something like that, but I can’t think of it too much, it’s too upsetting. But that little kernel of an event doesn’t go. It grows with you.” When he portrays deliberately scary people – such as Hannibal Lecter or Robert Ford in the Westworld series – he plays them quietly, emphasising their sinister control. His Lear, though, is explosive. “He’s completely bonkers – he laughs at the storm. That’s what I like about him.”In the film, Hopkins uses a horseshoe as his crown. He asked a friend, Drew Dalton, a props guy on Westworld who is also an Idaho farmer, to get it for him, and he told him it was from an old horse, born in 1925. When Hopkins talks about this horse, he gets a little teary. “I carry the horseshoe with me wherever I go now. I still get emotional about it – the power, and the loneliness, and the pain of that horse. That’s Lear.”Tears come easily to him, especially when he talks about hard work, old age, masculinity. His father, Dick, was a baker, a tough, practical man, born of another baker. But, Hopkins says, as he got older, small things would upset him, “like if he made a mistake in his car and drove off a ramp instead of getting it just right, he’d break down crying. Towards the end of his life, he used to drink, and he was unpredictable. Never violent, but sudden turns of rage, and then deep depressions. Turned on my mother, turned on me. I was old enough, so it didn’t bother me. We didn’t speak much before he died. He resented me for something. I understood it, I could get it, and I thought, ‘What a terrible, lonely horror, for people at the end of their lives.’”It’s easy to see how he drew on this for Lear. Hopkins has a daughter, too, Abigail, from his first marriage, but they don’t have a relationship, so there was no inspiration there. “No. I accepted it years ago. It’s her choice and she must live her life. I say to young people, ‘If your parents are giving you trouble, move out.’ You’ve got to let go. You don’t have to kill your parents, but just leave if it’s holding you back.”Lear came out of another BBC film, an adaptation of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, also directed by Eyre and broadcast in 2015. Hopkins was the ageing, belligerent actor Sir, who is preparing to play Lear Ian McKellen was Norman, his dresser. Hopkins had wanted to do the play since picking up a copy in a bookshop in Los Angeles, where he lives: “It opened the valves of nostalgia.”When he first became involved in the theatre, in the late 1950s, Hopkins was a stage manager, touring northern towns, meeting “old, wrecked, alcoholic, wonderful” vaudeville comedians who’d worked during the war, talking to stage hands who knew the technique of dropping the curtain for comedy (fast) and tragedy (very slow). Then he joined the National in the time of Olivier and Gielgud. He was impatient for success. “Oh,” he says, “I had nonspeaking parts, messengers and God knows what, and I was very disgruntled, because I wanted to be bigger. So I went to the casting director and said, ‘Who do you have to sleep with to get a part around here?’ I’d only been there three weeks!”The casting director was taken aback, but mentioned him to Olivier, who gave him a part as an IRA man in Juno And The Paycock. Hopkins knows now that his hubris was ludicrous, but he was anxious to get to the action, and still is. “I think, with life, just get on with it, you know?” he says. “We’re all going to die, and that’s a great motivator.”He’s always called himself a loner – “alone, loner, solitary”, he says to me – and in past interviews his outsiderdom has become almost his headline characteristic. But he and McKellen bonded, regaling each other with old stories instead of rehearsing. Having felt, for all those years, unwanted by the establishment, the establishment was making him welcome. He also realised that he wanted to do Lear for real.Not on stage, though. Despite his nostalgia, Hopkins hates the theatre. In 1973, he walked out of Macbeth mid-run at the National and moved to LA. The last stage play he was in was M Butterfly, in the West End in 1989. It was a torment, he says, the tipping point being a matinee where nobody laughed, “not a titter”. When the lights came up, the cast realised the entire audience was Japanese. “Oh God,” he recalls. “You’d go to your dressing room and someone would pop their head round the door and say, ‘Coffee? Tea?’ And I’d think, ‘An open razor, please.’”He can’t stand being unproductive, working without a point it drives him mad. David Hare once told Hopkins he’d never met anyone as angry: “And this was when I was off the booze!” He gave up drinking in 1975. For a while, he tried to quieten down his personality (“I was ever so careful”), but his mother told him it wasn’t working. “She said, ‘Why don’t you just be the bastard that you really are?’ She said, ‘I know what you’re like, you’re a monster.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘Well, OK then, be a monster.’“But the anger, you begin to channel it,” he says. “I’m very happy I’m an alcoholic – it’s a great gift, because wherever I go, the abyss follows me. It’s a volcanic anger you have, and it’s fuel. Rocket fuel. But of course it can rip you to pieces and kill you. So, gradually, over the years, I have learned not to be a people-pleaser. I don’t have a temper any more. I get impatient, but I try not to judge. I try to live and let live. I don’t get into arguments, I don’t offer opinions, and I think if you do that, then the anger finally begins to transform into drive.”Now, if he’s not acting, he paints, or plays the piano. He released an album of classical compositions, Composer, performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2011, which was well-received. “Hopkins writes with considerable flair and confidence,” said one critic, while Amazon gives it four stars. He began painting at the behest of Stella, who saw how he decorates his scripts. He goes over his lines around 250 times, until he can recite them backwards, sideways, in his sleep. Every time he reads them, he draws a doodle on his script, and the doodles, which start as small crosses, grow enormously large, covering all the blank space. Stella saw this and got him to paint “favours”, little presents for their wedding guests.“She said, ‘Well, if they don’t work, no one’s going to put you in jail,’” he says. And nobody did, because his paintings are pretty fine they sell for thousands of dollars. He shows me some on his phone. They’re expressionist, full of bright colours – “South American colours: Stella is Colombian” – and he’s working towards a show next year in St Petersburg, which he’s very excited about.“Ask me more questions!” he says. He doesn’t want to waste time sitting around while the photographer sets up. We talk animals. He and Stella collect stray cats and dogs. We talk politics. He doesn’t care about Trump he doesn’t vote. He takes a widescreen approach to politics, because focusing on the detail makes him too unhappy. “I don’t vote because I don’t trust anyone. We’ve never got it right, human beings. We are all a mess, and we’re very early in our evolution. Look back throughout history: you have the 20th century, the murder of 100 million people, barely 80 years ago. The 1914-18 war, the civil war in America, slaughter, bloodshed… I don’t know if there’s a design in it, but it is extraordinary to look at it and get a perspective. I think, ‘Well, if it’s the end, there’s nothing we can do about it, and it’ll blow over, whatever happens.’”He remembers talking to his father on the phone during the Cuban missile crisis (“and I was a raving Marxist then”) and his father remarking that the bomb would be dropped on London, so Hopkins would be all right, “because the bomb will drop on you, so you won’t know much about it. But in Wales, we’ll suffer the fallout.” His dad also once said to him, about Hitler and the second world war, “Six years later, he was dead in a bunker. So much for the Third Reich”, which makes me laugh.Now he avoids news and politics, for his peace of mind. “In America, they’re obsessed with healthy food,” he says. “They tell you, if you eat junk food, you get fat and you die. Well, television is run by money and corporate power and sponsorship. It’s junk food for the brain. Toxic.” If he’s not busy, he orders books online and sends them to friends – Wake Up And Live! by Dorothea Brande, The Life-Changing Magic Of Not Giving A F**k by Sarah Knight – or watches old films and TV on his iPad. He was obsessed with Breaking Bad, and wrote a lovely letter to Bryan Cranston extolling his acting now, he likes watching Midsomer Murders, The Persuaders and Rosemary \u0026amp Thyme.We talk a bit about the #MeToo movement. Hopkins says, about Harvey Weinstein, “I did know about the person you are referring to, about his sexual stuff. I know he is a rude man and a tyrant. But I avoided him, I didn’t want anything to do with people like that. Bullies.” And actually, despite his desire to live and let live, Hopkins often calls bullies out: when John Dexter, the director of M Butterfly, started shouting at everyone in the cast, Hopkins told him to stop. “I said, ‘John, you don’t need to do this. You’re a great director. Stop it.’ And he cried. I mean, I understand if people are bullies. They’ve got their problems. I can’t judge them, I won’t make fun of them at awards. It’s correct for women to stand up for themselves, because it’s unacceptable. But I don’t have a desire to dance on anyone’s grave.”He understands that we can all be terrible, and we can all be kind. Fame and power have nothing to do with it. I tell Hopkins something the singer Tony Bennett once said – “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough” – and he is delighted. “How extraordinary. What an amazing thing to say! You know, I meet young people, and they want to act and they want to be famous, and I tell them, when you get to the top of the tree, there’s nothing up there. Most of this is nonsense, most of this is a lie. Accept life as it is. Just be grateful to be alive.”He shows me a picture on his phone. It’s of him aged three, with his dad on a beach near Aberavon. His dad is grinning. Hopkins is a cherubic child, with golden curls, caught somewhere between laughing and crying. “I was upset because I’d dropped a cough sweet.” He keeps it because it reminds him of how far he’s come.“I think, ‘Good God, I should be in Port Talbot.’ Either dead, or working in my father’s bakery. For some inexplicable reason I’m here, and none of it makes sense. And I look at him and I say, ‘We did OK, kid.’”• King Lear is on BBC2 on Monday 28 May.Commenting on this piece?

But Spall’s latest film goes several steps further.In Stanley, A Man of Variety released in cinemas next month, he concocts a blistering string of recreations of several of the great comic variety acts of the past, incuding Max Wall, George Formby and Noël Coward. It is an extraordinary tour de force, but not a comfortable one to watch. Spall and his collaborator on the film, the director and writer Stephen Cookson, have a deeply unsettling argument to make and they do not hold back.“There is an appearance of cosy fun and jollity in these characters, but I now realise that as a child I always had a strong sense there was something sinister about their affability, or at least a wretched quality to it,” he told the Observer.Spall, 61, suspects that although it might look at first sight as if the modern British comic tradition, running down from the raucous stars of the music hall to the farcical antics of Alan Partridge, is peopled by a succession of lovable comic characters, the truth is more troubling. Whether the comic personas are bold and coarse, like Max Miller, or deadpan and wry, like Tony Hancock, they only really have a single buried message to bring their audience: the truth that life is cruel and lonely.“What I particularly wanted to get across in Stanley, A Man of Variety was this massive feeling I have about what it was really like to grow up in the postwar era. The point is, without wanting to get too intellectual about it, beyond all this affability there is a disquieting side. In fact, all the jolliness is underpinned by it.”It is a sombre thread running through postwar popular entertainment that Spall accepts could be called “British noir”, or perhaps more specifically, “English noir”.“There is the sense of a lost empire behind it and a fundamental brutality. I still associate that world with the horrible idea of the iron lung, with the cream tiles of a clinic, the upsetting ordinary horror of austerity during that period. A world with a normal yet tragic quality to it.”The film centres on the psychopathic personality of Stanley, also played by Spall. He is a prisoner who seems unsure of his crime and, increasingly, also of his identity. The shape of the story, its dialogue and the impersonations were developed by Spall with Cookson after long sessions of watching YouTube footage of the original performers.“I had worked with Steve before on a film I made with Brenda Blethyn called My Angel, and he brought me another script,” said Spall. “We didn’t end up doing that one, but there were elements we kept talking about. It was a vehicle for one person and for someone incarcerated. We talked a lot about the films we had seen as children. Steve had seen a lot of classic comedy and I was particularly interested in the idea of showing what goes on inside the imagination of the ignored person, of the terrible things that might happen in the mind of what you might call a Mr Beige.”The film has conscious echoes of the black Ealing comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets, in which Alec Guinness plays all the victims of Dennis Price’s imprisoned killer. But Spall had another source of inspiration.“I kept thinking of the atmosphere of Eraserhead, the 1977 David Lynch film,” he said. “And I also did not want it to be a simple set of comic turns from me. Each character’s appearance in the story had to be a way through to the next stage.”Cookson and Spall had “no masterplan”, however, and writing soon “hit a brick wall”. Discarding some of the characters, they took Stanley out of prison and brought in a potential redemptive note with the arrival of actor Alastair Sim, played by Spall, in the role of Dickens’s Scrooge. None of the original lines or catchphrases of the stars, who also include Frank\u0026nbspRandle and Margaret Rutherford, are used but the dialogue mimics their style.“We never announce who they are and it should not matter if you don’t know. It is not clear if they are really part of Stanley himself,” Spall explains. “Rutherford, who appears as a judge, is the one character I had actually played before in For One Night Only.”Cookson’s film pushes to the limit the idea there is pain at the core of comedy. The central character of Stanley deliberately has no sense of humour, in spite of his obsession with comic memorabilia. “We wanted to get across the idea these stars were actually quite frightening caricatures,” said Spall. “Tony Hancock’s comic persona, for example, has all that despair and loneliness, aside from the hysterical pretensions. The fact he thinks everyone else is a fool only serves to underline it.”Spall argues this loneliness is there in Steve Coogan’s Alan Partridge and in Ricky Gervais’s David Brent. “You don’t know if you want to hit them, to cuddle them or administer shock treatment. To find the root of all this darkness you would perhaps have to look back into urban folklore or to a demotic quality in our\u0026nbsplanguage.”Spall, who is about to start filming Stephen Poliakoff’s next project, Summer of Rockets, said that as he gets older he understands that good drama is really about the atmosphere you can create, rather than the story it seems to tell.“It is about creating a feeling and it’s something I struggle with in my painting. There is an inescapable normality that pops up just as you are reaching for something profound. And with comedy, if you’re not careful you can be so determined to be funny that it is actually disturbingly not so.”Stanley, A Man of Variety opens in London on 15 June and nationwide from 26 June "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec279721c2f90bbe28c77044c2b42d28287f6dc3/0_253_2663_1597/master/2663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfa28edd3029972b2f37da1ee53c8951","title":"memory lane the 1981 european cup final in pictures","story":"As Real Madrid and Liverpool meet in the 2018 Champions League final, we’ve had a rummage in the archives to check out what happened the last time they met in the final"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce929c945bd0ecc5e02dd79213331ab57074fb40/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490be877e47c8d093e68bc87563c567c","title":"real madrid v liverpool champions league final 2018 live","story":"The team news should be confirmed at around 6.45pm BST.

You won’t believe the score!We’ll have a leisurely build-up to the 7.45pm BST kick-off. Let’s start with the great Daniel Taylor’s preview from Kiev.Hello and welcome to live coverage of the biggest custody battle in Europe. Real Madrid and Liverpool both claim moral ownership of the Champions League. Madrid because they have won it a record 12 times Liverpool because they have won it five times and experienced a unique range of emotions in the process.These two are European royalty but that, pretty much, is where the similarities end tonight. This Champions League final offers a mouthwatering contrast: the winning experience of Real against the infectious naivety and devastating speed of Liverpool. Every decent forward line needs an acronym these days, and Liverpool’s sexy MFS could run Madrid’s geriatricos ragged. They are the main reason why Jurgen Klopp’s side are the most exhilarating team in Europe, maybe the world.Madrid have the best player in the world, maybe the best of all time, a ludicrous winner called Cristiano Ronaldo. If Madrid are victorious tonight he will join Liverpool, Barcelona and Bayern Munich on five European Cup wins. And Madrid would become the first team since Bayern in the mid-1970s to win the competition three years in a row. It’s hard to reconcile that potential achievement with their erratic performances en route to Kiev. But then this has been the most dramatic, illogical European season in yonks. Don’t bother trying to predict the result. Both teams know that attack isn’t the best form of defence it’s the only form. As such, all results are conceivable - except one. There is surely no way this will be 0-0.If you are a supporter of either side, or either side’s rivals, I humbly suggest the urgent procurement of something with a very generous ABV.

Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d6c078b886138b61ac0c59b610a9605f740997a/49_25_5266_3160/master/5266.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171bd8777848faee31afeb630589a09a","title":"a letter to my slob partner","story":"‘There are some quite basic things you could do, such as replacing your revolting pants’: the letter you always wanted to writeI know you think there should be more sex in this relationship, and I know you think it’s my fault. But you must realise that nobody is obliged to have sex if they don’t want to, even if they are in a long-term relationship. I never signed up to anything or made any promises to you. I can exercise my own free will about what I do with my body, just as I can about what I eat and how I spend my spare time.Instead of focusing on me, therefore, I think a positive move for you would be to consider your own level of sexual appeal and how it can be enhanced. Although men tend not to obsess about their physical appearance in the way women are encouraged to, maybe you should have a think about it. Nobody wants to get into body-shaming but there are some quite basic things you could do, such as getting a haircut that doesn’t look as if it was done with a knife and fork, and buying jeans that fit so as to minimise the appearance of the builder’s arse whenever you bend down. Most of your pants are pretty revolting, too: new pants are not expensive.There is also your behaviour. Never offering someone any help, support, kind deeds, compliments or affection is all very well, but I really think it is only polite that that should be extended to never offering them sexual opportunities either, by which I mean slyly pawing or pressing against them in bed. If you want the sex, then start by doing the other stuff.Finally, I think you should consider the potential aphrodisiac properties of being less messy and performing simple everyday household tasks, so I don’t have to. Put the dishwasher on. Clean the worktops. Refrain from flicking teabags into the bin so I don’t have to repaint the kitchen wall every six months. As someone once said, it’s hard to shout at a man when he’s vacuuming. And on the flip side, it’s hard to find a man attractive when you have washed his undies and scrubbed the loo and carried out all those other acts of drudgery. There is a possibility that doing all this will render you tired and resentful enough to put you off sex, too let me say that I am willing to take that risk.It is quite possible that you will do all of these things and I will still give you the cold shoulder. But at least then you can say you have tried, and if it does happen then I will happily take the blame and wear the mantle of “frigid bitch” with pride.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

But at least three young Brits have lost their lives, as Rupert Neate reportsIf Dirk Zimmerman’s boss fancies a fresh tomato salad, the 35-year-old German hangs up his chef’s apron, dons a headset and takes to the skies. Zimmerman, who has been working on superyachts for more than a decade, has lost count of the number of times he’s been sent out on a ship’s helicopter or seaplane to source food, from courgettes in Oman to truffles in Argentina or vine tomatoes from a nearby Pacific atoll.“It might shock you to know how much money some people spend privately,” he says as he prepares sushi in the professional-grade kitchen on the 60-metre St David, moored in Monaco. “But to be able to take a helicopter and fly two hours somewhere to get the boss’s preferences makes his day.”As the rich become even richer – 145 more dollar billionaires were minted last year – orders for new superyachts (longer than 24 metres) have hit a record high. More than 500 are being built in shipyards around the world, and with many requiring at least 100 staff, superyachts now employ more than 37,000 people. Britain’s seafaring history has made it the biggest source of employees crewing on a superyacht is so popular among young adventurers that Southampton Solent University now offers degree-level training at its Warsash Superyacht Academy. Every spring, dozens of young Brits decamp to Antibes on the Côte d’Azur, the unofficial centre for superyacht crew recruitment, where you can wander along the docks looking for opportunities.While it is a dream job for some, other deckhands and chefs have horror stories of working punishing hours. Accidents, injuries and deaths are also commonplace, with union leaders believing working on superyachts to be more dangerous than life on oil rigs over the past few years at least three young Brits have died while serving their billionaire bosses. Because many superyachts continually float around the world (this is marketed to some as a way to avoid being registered in any country and hence to avoid paying tax), their crews may not be afforded the same legal protections as those on land. Families complain about a lack of assistance and sympathy from owners and those in charge of the vessel. None of the owners attended the three British men’s funerals.Michael Hanlon, 22, left Cumbria for his dream job as a deckhand and watersports instructor on 62-metre superyacht Faith, owned by the Canadian fashion billionaire Lawrence Stroll, in March 2013. Less than a month later, and before he’d had a chance to spend any of his first $3,500 (£2,600) monthly pay cheque, he was dead.Michael, known as Milo to his friends and family, had returned exhausted from a night out to the vessel docked in Antibes on the French Riviera. He had done two shifts back to back, working night and day, then gone to local bars to celebrate sailing across the Atlantic. Faith had been locked up for the night, and Michael climbed to its top in an attempt to get inside via an unofficial emergency entrance. An inquest found he fell from the top deck, hit his head on the quay and drowned. His body was recovered the next day.Jacob Nichol, from Cornwall, died last summer, aged 24, two years after he suffered severe brain injuries after falling from superyacht Kibo, while cleaning it as it was docked in a Majorcan port. Jacob, the yacht’s third assistant engineer, had been hanging in a harness when he fell and fractured his skull. His sister, Jenade Moon, said he had never been asked to clean the boat before: his job focused on engine maintenance. The owner of the £90m yacht, Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut – until last month owner of Waterstones, and friend of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich – was not on board at the time.After 10 days in a coma in a hospital in Palma, Jacob was repatriated to Shropshire, where he needed constant care. In September an inquest recorded a verdict of accidental death. “Our beautiful Jacob has sadly passed away,” his family said. “A young, bright, intelligent, kind soul has left us after an excruciating two years.”In 2010, Robin Black received a call from the captain of the £15m sailing superyacht Burrasca, on which Black’s son Will was bosun, or officer in charge of crew and equipment. At the time, it was moored at the Monaco yacht show in Port Hercules, the annual beauty parade held in the industry’s global hub. The captain told Black that Will, 28, hadn’t been seen since the night before, when the rib he was piloting (a small boat used to ferry passengers to and from the yacht) collided with another boat. He thought Will may have been knocked overboard.By the time Robin, Will’s mother Judith and his sister Rosanna, now 37, arrived in Monaco to join the search, the yacht had left. “The captain said: ‘Don’t worry, we threw some flowers over the side and gave his belongings to the police,’” Rosanna says, fighting back tears as she describes “the worst days of our lives”. “I couldn’t comprehend that the boat had gone before Will was found and before we got there,” she says. “How could they just leave a family to deal with the death of one of their crew, and the police and paperwork and everything? I can’t believe that if something goes wrong – if someone dies – they can just raise the anchor and leave.”The family don’t know who owns Burrasca, though he is thought to have been a Russian billionaire (owners do not have to declare themselves). He was not on board at the time of the accident. The yacht did not request ers to look for Will’s body, leaving the captain of another superyacht, who was a friend, to pay for search and recovery ers. But they were unable to find Will, who had not been wearing a life vest.Will’s life was not insured. “But it’s not about money,” Rosanna says, “it’s about respect for another life.” She says that the owner didn’t and doesn’t seem to have cared. A spokesman for the yacht’s management did not respond to the ’s requests for comment.If something goes wrong on a superyacht, it can be incredibly difficult for crew and their families to understand which laws and rights apply. Vessels are often operating in international waters, their day-to-day operations run by management companies on behalf of often unidentifiable owners their yachts are registered via offshore companies in places such as Panama or the British Virgin Islands.To add to the confusion, superyachts can be registered with another country and fly their flag, even if the yacht is not based there. At the time of Will’s death, Burrasca was registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines. There was no British inquest, and local authorities recorded this report of the accident: “Mr William Black was on tender duty between the mothership at anchor and the shore. The anchorage was very crowded. Returning to the mothership, the tender hit an unattended vessel that was anchored in the bay. The tender was found drifting with no one on board… Mr Black’s body was not found.”Will, who had always wanted a life of adventure, had worked his way up from a deckhand on smaller boats to an officer on Burrasca. He’d recently begun his role as bosun on the 55.7-metre yacht and Rosanna says he was passionate about his job. “Will had found his calling. He worked hard, but he played hard, too, and always came back with the most amazing stories,” she says as she shows me photos of Will on a night out with 50 Cent and Jamiroquai. “We still get letters from some of the families he worked for. They send cards for Uncle Whale, as he was called,” she says. “He had a huge personality and everyone loved him.”Despite the circumstances of his death, Rosanna says she would not discourage others from joining the superyachting world. “I would just tell them to make sure they’re always on top of safety, and to find out who the owner is before they join.”It’s shorts, T-shirts and deck shoes weather at the Monaco yacht show, as I weave my way through champagne receptions, passing Ferraris and Aston Martins for sale on the quayside. This year’s display of yachts is collectively worth more than £2bn the combined annual spending on the world’s 6,281 superyachts could wipe out all developing countries’ debts.There are so many superyachts docked for the show that Top Shop boss Sir Philip Green’s £100m Lionheart has been forced out of its mooring into the Bay of Monaco. The 110-metre Jubilee, which was built for the late emir of Qatar, is on sale for $300m.On board the six-cabin St David, which is on sale for just under £20m, Zimmerman is preparing canapes for a party. He says the industry keeps many people in well-paid employment, adding that he can’t envisage going back to work on land, as “the pay cannot compare. I have three children, and working here pays for their education.” But, he adds, newbies have to decide early on whether they can sit by and watch their billionaire bosses spend vast amounts enjoying themselves, while appearing not to care about those around them. “It’s a compromise that everyone has to make – can you accept it?”Liz Brasler, 29, is chief mate, or second-in-command, of one of the yachts in the harbour. She won’t say which but “it’s one of the bigger ones”. She has worked her way up the ranks from deckhand since 2006. “It can be great fun but it’s also exhausting, delivering the highest standards invisibly, magically, with no apparent fuss,” she says. “Owners expect the best in the world. They want to go wherever, whenever, and demand the highest standards without delay. Money is not a problem for them.”For most of her career, Brasler, who is South African, bunked with colleagues in small cabins now she has a cabin of her own. But while she has more privacy, she says she can’t remember the last time she had seven hours’ sleep while on charter or at sea.The billionaires’ superyacht designer of choice, Andrew Winch, knows all about the needs of the super-rich. We speak on Cloud 9, the 74-metre, £59m yacht he designed for the Australian retail tycoon Brett Blundy this is the first time he has stepped aboard since he handed it over. Winch, who has designed yachts in a London studio since 1986, created Madame Gu, the 2014 motor yacht of the year, and Phoenix 2, owned by the late Polish billionaire Jan Kulczyk. His yacht designs have proved so popular that he now designs clients’ homes and planes, including Roman Abramovich’s Boeing 767.“Most clients will have three, four or five houses around the world,” he says. “We have clients we’ve already worked with on their jet and their yacht, and soon there will be a ‘rollover’ and we’ll start on another sequence.”Everything on board is designed for the owner, from the bedroom suites named after Star Wars characters (his favourite film), to the extra head space above the gym’s treadmill (he’s tall) and the proliferation of chess sets: “He likes to play chess, for several days, with various guests at the same time,” Winch says. In the hair salon, a wall folds down to create a balcony “because it’s very nice, when the sun’s setting in Greece, to have a massage outside”.A short ride downstairs in the ship’s glass-topped elevator is the “beach club” at the bow. From here Blundy and his guests can hit the water with the boat’s “toys”, including a speedboat for waterskiing, jetskis and what Winch calls a “James Bond-style personal submarine”. A “water sports and boys’ toys” instructor will be on hand to help guests get the hang of it and take care of “all the boring things”, like cleaning and clearing away. For guests who dislike the swell or salt of the ocean, there’s a swimming pool above an espresso bar.The ship’s teacher, one of 22 staff, is on hand to guide their learning. There’s also a nanny, personal trainer, masseuse and hairdresser. “You take your life with you,” Winch explains.“Life on board is perfect for owners – they receive a seven-star service. But for officers and crew it can be a lot more difficult,” says Danny McGowan, the strategic organiser of seafarers’ union, Nautilus International. He has come from their offices in London to the Monaco show to draw attention to the deaths of young workers, highlighting the dangers of working in an industry that to outsiders appears the height of glamour.“They will often be working very long hours, right around the clock, looking after guests,” says the fair-skinned, red-haired McGowan, sheltering from the sun in Monaco’s famous La Rascasse bar, which a crew recruitment company has hired out for the week. “These are tragic situations where young people have lost their lives, and there are hundreds of other injuries and complaints that aren’t reported.” He says staff have had their passports confiscated and wages withheld they talk of being sent home for the slightest uniform infraction.Superyacht owners can view crew as “dispensable and replaceable” and don’t consider the impact on their families. “Often an owner feels they can just get a new third engineer, rather than thinking of the consequences for the inidual,” he says. “We’re not here to be up against these billionaires. We want to work with them to make employment in this industry better.”Most recently, McGowan has been representing the 42-strong crew of a £67m superyacht owned by the Indian multimillionaire Vijay Mallya. The crew, among them several Britons, haven’t been paid for months, and are owed more than $1m. McGowan helped them take their case to court, to have the yacht impounded in Malta. Mallya, a co-owner of the Force India Formula One team, was arrested in London last year over allegations that he supported the team with laundered cash, and Indian authorities are currently seeking his extradition to face trial. He is living in a Hertfordshire mansion while on bail the yacht, which features a 15-seat cinema and Sir Elton John’s baby grand piano, remains impounded, with some of the crew still on board.Sitting on the harbour wall overlooking Cloud 9 and a fleet of other superyachts, Fiona Hanlon fights back tears as she remembers the “heartbreakingly impersonal” way she was informed of the death of her 22-year-old son, Michael.Hanlon has flown to Monaco from the family home in the Lake District to scatter Michael’s ashes. At the same time, knowing he had worked two shifts back to back, she is taking the opportunity to highlight the plight of some other superyacht crew, who she says are often forced to work long hours – conditions that might be illegal in the UK. “It was Michael’s dream job,” she says. He grew up sailing on Windermere. “He had just got his first salary and he’d sent me photographs of the sunglasses and travelling guitar he was going to buy. He was so excited, it was wonderful.”Michael had been texting his mother daily updates about his adventures sailing across the Atlantic. But on 7 April 2013, Fiona’s phone didn’t ping. She texted him: “Worried about you now – no contact gets me thinking something is wrong – say hello soon please x” followed by, “My baby where are you x x please get in touch angel – we just want to know you are OK.”The next day his mother was told Michael was missing. “It was seen as an inconvenience, as the boat was going on to pick up Catherine Zeta-Jones,” she says. The following day Michael’s body was found under the yacht by police ers.The coroner for Cumbria, Philip Sharp, ruled that he died from drowning and recorded a verdict of accidental death. He wrote to the yacht’s registered owner – a PO box in the British Virgin Islands – to raise concerns that “crew members and in this case the deceased were likely to have been asked to work additional shifts when the boat came in to port, potentially causing tiredness”. Sharp’s letter required the yacht’s owner to provide all crew with a key to the boat, and to ensure the captain check the crew are not required to work excessive hours.An unnamed director of the superyacht’s owner, Pluteus Limited (a company based in Monaco, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and registered in the Cayman Islands), wrote to the coroner to say: “We are keen to cooperate and address the concerns you have identified as a result of the inquest. However, please note that in doing so, no acknowledgment or admission of failings or liability is intended or to be inferred.”The director said that access to the yacht had been improved by the provision of keyless codes to all staff. It was also promised that working hours would be monitored, “to ensure crew members are not working additional hours without the requisite rest periods, in particular between shifts, unless the safety of the boat, crew and passengers is in danger”.Meanwhile, chief mate Liz Brasler is wondering what job she might do next. She says that while working on superyachts has been fun, it can be difficult, demoralising and sometimes dangerous. Friends have been injured and she knows of others who have died. “We’re insured, but it doesn’t cover everything. I know the price of my life,” she says. “And it’s less than my parents think.”• Commenting on this piece?

But I’m a chef, so I can’t help myself. When they’re super-fresh, I’ll still put peas raw in a salad, but otherwise I might blanch them very lightly, throw them, pods and all, on a hot grill or cook them for so long that they turn almost khaki-grey. There’s a real versatility to the humble little pea, and sometimes it pays not to eat them straight from the pod.This warm side salad is all about the beautiful leaves, vegetables and herbs. I’ve used a few different types of radicchio, but you could also use chicory or whatever mix of bitter leaves you can get your hands on. Not much more than garlic and lemon is needed to make this sing, but a few drops of chilli oil wouldn’t go amiss, too.Prep 12 minCook 12 minServes 4 as a side3 small garlic cloves, peeled and crushed3-4 lemons, zest finely grated, to get 1½ tbsp, and juiced, to get 60ml75ml olive oilFlaked sea salt and black pepper450g mixed radicchio leaves, ideally pink, taro and castelfranco, trimmed and roughly torn600g sugar snap peas, fibrous threads removed3 tbsp dill leaves, roughly chopped3 tbsp tarragon leaves, roughly choppedPut the first three ingredients in a small bowl with three teaspoons of salt and plenty of pepper.Put half the leaves and all the sugar snaps in a large bowl, pour over two-thirds of the garlic and lemon mixture, and toss to coat.Heat a large griddle pan on a high heat (as always, remember to ventilate the kitchen first). Once very hot, turn down the heat to medium, then griddle the dressed leaves and sugar snaps for about four minutes, turning every now and then, until everything has good char marks – spread them out in the pan, so they all get some heat, and cook in batches if need be.Transfer the griddled vegetables to a large bowl, add the raw leaves, herbs and the remaining dressing, toss gently and serve at once.This party snack is a bit of a commitment – get a helper, if you can – but it pays off when that green bechamel filling comes oozing out, all delicious and warm. That said, you can roll them a day ahead, refrigerate overnight and fry from room temperature the next day.Prep 30 minCook 30 min, plus 20-30 min to roll the cigarsMakes 2450g unsalted butter, plus 150g melted butter extra, for brushing 40g plain flour400ml whole milk1 tsp dijon mustardSalt and black pepper250g baby spinach20g basil leaves, roughly chopped10g mint leaves, roughly chopped½ tsp ground Iranian lime (optional)1½ tsp fennel seeds, toasted and lightly crushed300g fresh or defrosted frozen peas350g blanched fresh or defrosted frozen broad beans, skins removed200g feta, roughly crumbled into 2cm pieces300g filo pastry (ie, 12 39cm x 30cm sheets) 1 egg, beaten500ml sunflower oil3 lemons, cut into wedges, to servePut 50g butter and the flour in a medium saucepan on a medium heat, and stir constantly until the butter and flour have come together and are bubbling – about four minutes. Mix together the milk, mustard, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, then add to the flour pan in three instalments, whisking all the time, until you have a smooth sauce. Turn the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes, whisking frequently, then leave to cool.Put the spinach in a medium pan on a medium-high heat, add a splash of water and cook for two to three minutes, until wilted, then drain in a colander and leave to cool. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze out as much water as you can: you should end up with about 150g cooked spinach. Put this in a food processor with the bechamel sauce, herbs, Iranian lime (if using), fennel seeds and half the peas, and pulse a few times to break down the spinach and peas a little. Tip into a large bowl, gently stir in the remaining peas, broad beans, feta and two-thirds of a teaspoon of salt, then refrigerate.Take one sheet of filo and, with the longest edge facing towards you, cut it in half lengthways. Brush both pieces with a little melted butter. Spoon 50g (or two to three tablespoons) of filling on one of the shorter ends of one of the two pieces of filo, then use your hands to form the filling into a sausage shape, leaving 2cm of pastry clear at the bottom. Fold the bottom end of the pastry up over the filling, then roll up into a thick cigar, tucking in the sides as you go. Lightly brush the ends of the pastry with a little egg wash, then seal (the egg wash will prevent the filling from escaping when cooking). Do the same with the second piece of filo, then repeat with the remaining filo sheets until you have 24 cigars.Heat the oil in a medium pan on a medium-high flame: it’s hot enough when a small piece of excess pastry browns within five to 10 seconds. Carefully put four or five cigars into the hot oil and fry for two to three minutes in all, turning once halfway, until golden brown all over. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cigars to a plate lined with kitchen paper, sprinkle with salt, and keep warm while you repeat with the remaining cigars (lower the heat if they start to colour too quickly). Serve hot with the lemon wedges alongside.This is my version of vignole, a traditional Roman dish that celebrates green spring vegetables.

In a preliminary ruling this week, Ofcom says it has “reasonable grounds to believe” that Virgin has contravened its general conditions which state companies cannot charge excessive fees that disincentivise customers from switching supplier.The company may also have fallen foul of Ofcom rules by failing to publish clear information on fees,\u0026nbspand by requiring customers who move home to sign a new fixed-term contract or face an early termination charge.“Having assessed all available evidence, we have reasonable grounds to believe Virgin Media has broken our rules,” says Ofcom. “Virgin Media now has an opportunity to formally respond to our provisional decision. We will take any further representations the company makes into account before our final ruling.”Ofcom launched its investigation in response to a high number of complaints about the cable giant.But the most contentious issue – early termination charges levied on those who move home but to an area not served by Virgin’s cable network so cannot get the service even if they wish to continue – is not yet covered by Ofcom’s rules.Earlier this year,  reported how 80-year-old Ann Squires was forced to pay £136.88 when she had to leave her home of 40 years and move to a flat three miles away.When she notified Virgin of her new address she was told that it could no longer provide a service and yet still demanded an early termination charge for cancelling her contract. It issued a default notice under the Consumer Credit Act when she challenged the fee.Numerous other customers have also been forced to pay up even though Virgin told them it could no longer provide a service.Surprisingly, Ofcom says: “The terms that require Virgin customers moving home outside of its network to pay early termination charges do not fall within Ofcom’s rules.“We are continuing to consider whether they raise concerns under general consumer law. We will provide an update on this aspect of its investigation in due course.”Virgin Media says: “We have received Ofcom’s provisional findings and we will now review them thoroughly. We make it clear to customers that early disconnection fees can apply and we also offer 30-day rolling contracts for those that do not want to sign up for a minimum period, such as 12 months, and need more flexibility.”This month Ofcom announced an investigation into the early termination fees charged by EE."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6309ac32ad22281307b6fb1cd905f55601fb4e41/0_312_5668_3401/master/5668.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9893bb498f28ae20f8b0c9b376fc4cd","title":"rolling stones london stadium live review","story":"We could be in a big venue anywhere in the world. Fans wearing Rolling Stones merchandise converse in various tongues. The bars speak the international language of weak lager.You know you are in a former Olympic venue in a recently reinvented bit of London, however, because you can just spy the top curve of Anish Kapoor’s audacious sculpture, the ArcelorMittal Orbit, peeking out above the rim of West Ham’s stadium. It looks like a big fat red lip – inadvertently echoing the unapologetic leer of the Rolling Stones’ logo, reproduced repeatedly tonight on the backs of fans and on the giant screens behind the stage.“It’s nice to be back in Londuuuuhn,” confirms Mick Jagger, with just the right level of offhand, proprietorial camp at the start of a summer of British fixtures. Later, Jagger will talk about this venue not being far from a place he remembers as “Dalston Baths” – it’s either Leyton Baths, where the Stones played in 1963, or Dalston’s Chez Don club (same era) places not that far away spatially, but a foreign country, conceptually.As the ley lines run, we’re not all that far from Sidcup either, where a fresh-faced Keith Richards was studying at art college when he bumped into his former schoolmate Jagger on a train platform and they bonded over some vinyl. Much as things often aren’t what they used to be, especially in London, that art college is now a Morrison’s. Leyton Baths is a Tesco. The stadium itself displaced a mountain of disused\u0026nbspfridges.Everything feels so spectacularly unmoored these days. But some things are more impervious to the ravages of time and the disruptiveness of recent history than geography or architecture. As much as is humanly possible, the Rolling Stones are exactly what they used to be – scrawny Englishmen with a thing for the blues, capable of reproducing the foundation documents of rock music with guts and flair. You’d go see Bach if he were alive: this is the white guy guitar band equivalent.There are times tonight, though, where this Stones gig can feel like a museum piece whose exhibits might require a little more curation, given modern sensibilities. Some of these songs have the air of semi-naked native mannequins posed to look awed at overdressed colonialists acceptable at the time, perhaps, but questionable now. A lairy and louche Midnight Rambler is the extended showpiece of tonight’s set. Slowing down, speeding up, the band work their way through some call-and-response into an magnificently abstract lull, where Mick Jagger twitches his way backwards down the catwalk, the anchoring keyboards of Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford are muted and Ron Wood and Keith Richards are not playing so much as issuing prangs of guitar – an interlude that feels unscripted and alive. It’s the best advert for the Stones as a working band, that rolling, itinerant carnival of cutting loose.If the past is another country, however, where they do things differently, nowhere is the lacuna between then and now more noticeable than on Rolling Stones songs about rapist murderers, a slaver’s penchant for young African girls (Brown Sugar), and keeping women subservient (Under My Thumb, a fan selection, in which Jagger preens over what nowadays we might call coercive control). That great extended blues, Midnight Rambler, celebrates a rapist as a kind of outlaw, wreaking countercultural vengeance on the smug\u0026nbspwithin their “marble halls”.If a modern lens exposes some unsightly blemishes, the edifice that is the Stones certainly seems bulletproof. Charlie Watts’s profile might have grown a little more hawk-like since London last saw him in 2013, but he gazes down upon the complicated business of rock’n’roll with a jazz drummer’s hauteur in a pressed blue linen shirt. He dons headphones for a couple of tracks – the awesomely slinky disco of Miss You probably operates to a click track – but otherwise remains largely unmoved.Wood (“the Hogarth of Hounslow”, as Jagger introduces him) and Richards spend the first couple of songs looking worried, accentuating the topography of their crevassed faces. It’s a nice touch, that these gurning multimillionaires seem to care enough to frown their way through Street Fighting Man and It’s Only Rock’n’Roll, fretting as well as strutting.Throughout, Jagger is nothing short of superhuman, his voice deserving of a monument of some kind. An entire generation is losing theirs: Dylan’s reduced to a parched wheeze, Neil Young’s more wilfully inconstant than ever, Paul McCartney not quite hitting the high notes, and Paul Simon embarking on a farewell tour while the going’s good. Jagger’s yowl is as elastic as Lycra and as powerful as it needs to \u0026nbspbe to boom out across the stadium (and bounce back disconcertingly: this venue was not\u0026nbspbuilt for sound). As toned as a racing whippet, he can still launch into his trademark series of\u0026nbspsignature spasms, like James Brown and Tina\u0026nbspTurner doing the waggle dance in a blender.Constancy being a Stones byword, it’s the hits tonight. Variety comes in the form of a blues cover, from their recent Blue and Lonesome album (Ride ’Em on Down), and two unnecessary solo compositions by Keith Richards. These totally undermine his piratical persona by revealing a frail singing voice and a deep seam of sentimentality.Some of these hits feel rote and some still capable of electrifying frissons.

It’s madness.”Campbell, one of Blair’s most loyal lieutenants, said he still could not get over Corbyn being leader. “I’ve known him on and off for 40 years and I find it incredible, the whole thing incredible.“I hate what he has done to the Labour party and his position on Brexit, I’m afraid, absolutely does my head in because the Labour party is meant to be the party for working people and working people are going to get absolutely shafted by Brexit.”Campbell said Corbyn could win the next election but would not. Many people had voted Labour last time because they knew Corbyn would not win, he said, but next time would be different.“There is such a gap between this ‘oh Jeremy Corbyn world’ where he is transported from one adoring audience to the next and what actually is happening with the public.“Labour lost the election against the worst campaign there has ever been and since then they have behaved like they’ve won – it just does my head in.”Campbell said the last election was a tragedy because it involved two competing visions of the past – the 1950s for Theresa May and 1970s for Corbyn.In an entertaining session, he spoke about his dislike of big crowds, such as the ones for the royal wedding – “I hate those things where everyone is meant to feel something” – and which political memoirs would be remembered by future generations.His diaries would be studied, he said. He had read many of the memoirs from the time of the last Labour government and he admired some more than others. He liked Blair’s and Alan Johnson’s.Did he enjoy Peter Mandelson’s book? “Erm ...

They are demanding that Brexit is fully discussed and voted on by delegates at the Labour party conference in Liverpool in September. The gathering will take place before any vote by MPs in parliament on the outcome of negotiations between Theresa May and Brussels.The calls for involvement of the mass membership come as the leadership faces growing pressure from Labour MPs, peers and members to take a more pro-EU, pro-single-market approach as the main political parties prepare for a series of crucial Commons votes on the EU withdrawal bill in less than three weeks.A spokesman for Momentum said the organisation remained supportive of the leadership on Brexit. But, increasingly, elements within Momentum and the trade union movement are demanding the right to be heard on the most important policy issue of the day, in line with Corbyn’s repeated pledges to involve members at every turn. The Trades Union Congress is expected to intensify its demands for the party to back staying in the single market in the coming months.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Rida Vaquas, a former member of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “The left has always stood against stage-managed conferences from the days of Blair, where decisions of substance are made behind closed doors whilst party members are given no chances to have robust debates on the direction of our party.“A Corbyn-led Labour party can only be strengthened by vigorous discussion among our own ranks, on our political differences as well as what unites us. How we approach Brexit is an issue of decisive importance and it is therefore only right it is debated at conference. Socialists can never succeed by dodging political questions, only by facing them head on.”Michael Chessum, who was on Momentum’s first steering committee in 201617 and is now national organiser of the leftwing anti-Brexit group Another Europe is Possible, said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the rest of the Labour leadership are principled people.“They have spent decades fighting for democracy in the party and against the idea that important decisions can be made in smoky backrooms by officials. So I’m confident that they will support the right of members to democratically debate issues as pivotal as Brexit and free movement. There should be a consensus around that.“Labour isn’t negotiating this deal, and the closer we get to exit day, the clearer it gets that the Tories’ Brexit agenda is going to be a disaster for the rights, freedoms and prosperity of working-class people and the communities that Labour and the left are supposed to represent. It is urgent that we clearly place an alternative to Brexit on the table – one linked to a radical vision for society under a Corbyn-led Labour government.”At last year’s Labour conference in Brighton, Momentum and some of the unions joined forces to prevent the Brexit issue being debated in order to avoid exposing the party split and embarrassing the relatively Eurosceptic Corbyn. At the time, many of his MPs and peers were pushing for him to back permanent membership of the single market.This year the arguments over Brexit look likely to be even more heated and calls for a debate will be far more difficult to resist in September, when the date of the UK’s departure will be less than six months away.Another Momentum member, Omar Raii, who sits on the London Young Labour committee and is a former NUS national executive committee member, said: “On an issue as big as this it would be unacceptable if we decided to determine our policy behind closed doors. It would be the worst kind of Blairite approach.”“It’s hugely important that Labour members democratically thrash out policy at conference on all issues, especially one as huge as Brexit. I hope to see Labour articulate a genuinely internationalist policy that opposes the reactionary, anti-migrant plans the Tories have for us.”At a recent conference of the centre-left grouping Progess, nine candidates for Labour’s national executive committee launched the campaign LabourSay.EU to push for a meaningful vote on Brexit at the Labour conference.Earlier this month, student unions representing almost 1 million young people studying at UK colleges and universities signed a statement calling for a “people’s vote” or second referendum on the final deal negotiated by May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801eca4eeadb31735529ee7c2597012a1115cb6a/0_76_2631_1579/master/2631.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89ae7cc057786335c87d28234116892f","title":"may playing hide and seek brexit talks barnier eu chief negotiator","story":"Prime minister wants to blame Brussels for UK’s problems, EU chief negotiator claimsTheresa May has been accused of playing “hide and seek” in the Brexit talks and attempting to pin the blame for the damaging consequences on Brussels, in a damning speech by the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.After a fraught week of negotiations, during which the UK declined to spell out its proposed solution for avoiding a hard border with Ireland or offer positions on a range of crucial issues, Barnier gave a withering assessment of the prime minister’s approach.He suggested that the UK was seeking to blame the EU for the problems that have emerged in recent days, from the shutting out of British firms from the £8bn Galileo satellite project to the rejection of the UK’s proposed retention of the powers of the European arrest warrant and continued say in the shaping of data laws.But the former French minister told a conference of lawyers in Portugal on Saturday that the UK now needed to offer a “realistic” vision of the future and own up to the consequences of its own decisions.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group.

Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.The speed of the talks needed to be accelerated, Barnier said, adding that without a solution to the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic there would be no overall deal or a transition period to shield UK companies from a cliff-edge Brexit on 29 March 2019.“If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it will have to tell us. The earliest would be best,” he said.“And, of course, we are open. There is no ideology or dogmatism on our part. The European council has made it clear that the UK can change its mind. We simply ask for clarity.“Because to negotiate effectively, you must know what the other party wants. A negotiation cannot be a part of hide and seek.”He added: “We need realistic proposals from the UK. Proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.“It is the United Kingdom that leaves the European Union. It cannot, on leaving, ask us to change who we are and how we operate.”Barnier said the UK wanted to both change the bloc and have a say in EU matters after Brexit. But he told the lawyers in the audience that “these British ideas pose real problems”. He said: “The United Kingdom must look the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.“For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It is its decision. Not ours.”Last week the British negotiating team proposed that the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the largest data protection authority in the EU, sit on the body that will regulate the new GDPR data rules.It also wishes to be part of the “one-stop shop” mechanism, whereby only one supervisory authority, rather than multiple bodies across the EU, decides on cross-border data disputes, so at to give EU and UK firms greater certainty.But, Barnier said that such privileged access would impact on the EU’s ability to make its own decisions.He said: “Let’s be clear: Brexit is not and will never be in the interest of EU companies. And above all it would be contrary to the interests of our companies to give up our autonomy of decision.“This autonomy allows us to set standards for the whole of the EU but also often to see these standards taken over the world.“It is the normative power of the union or what is often called ‘the Brussels effect’. And we cannot, we will not be able to share this decisional autonomy with a third country, undoubtedly a former member state but which no longer wants to be in the same legal ecosystem as us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0737584742596ba7b6c2b27d26e1778eb22a6f8/257_266_3729_2238/master/3729.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=534c031c5fbb2b302af04b035b1c2b5c","title":"nasas golden record may baffle alien life say researchers","story":"Extraterrestrials will discover a species that loves to argue and sees beauty in flowers that roar like chainsawsIt was launched to the stars as a portrait of humanity: an alien’s guide to life on Earth and the wonderful, rich culture of its dominant species.But the Golden Record, blasted into space by Nasa in 1977, may deliver an entirely different message to any extraterrestrials who happen to encounter the cosmic missive, researchers point out.Rather than the peaceful, intelligent beings that the US space agency hoped to portray, humans may come across as a species that loves to argue, speaks gibberish, and sees beauty in flowers that roar like chainsaws.The potential for the Golden Record, copies of which are aboard Nasa’s Voyager 1 and 2 probes, to mislead alien life will be raised by researchers at the National Space Society meeting in Los Angeles on Saturday.Rebecca Orchard and Sheri Wells-Jensen at Bowling Green State University in Ohio say that the record’s 117 pictures, humpback whale sounds, greetings in 54 languages, 20-minute “sound essay” of life on Earth, and 90 minute romp through the planet’s music, is decidedly human-centric.“The Golden Record is a beautiful artefact and representation of how humans want to see themselves, but it is meant to be received by and interpreted by something that has the sensory capabilities of the average human,” said Orchard. “If the second one of these senses is absent, or an entirely different sense is added, the Golden Record becomes a bit confusing.”Orchard and Wells-Jensen went through the material on the record and considered what an alien civilisation with a different suite of senses might make of it. The barrage of greetings “pile up in a way that could be construed as arguing”, said Orchard, in a language that has “no grammatical congruity”. That is, if they can hear.The 12-inch gold-plated copper disc has audio on one side and images on the other, and this could lead to further misunderstandings, the researchers believe. If an alien civilisation tried to match sounds to their objects, life on Earth can look very strange. “What if you pair the image of an open daffodil with the roar of a chainsaw?” said Orchard.Perhaps the most baffling of all would be the music which ranges from Bach and Stravinsky to Javanese gamelan and Bulgarian folk music. “I obviously can’t say how these differences and transitions will be interpreted, but what I can say is that it definitely creates a puzzle for a listener who would be completely unfamiliar with humans and the noises they make,” Orchard said.Whatever confusion the record may cause, it is unlikely to happen soon. While Voyager 1 is now 12bn miles away and the farthest human-made object from Earth, it will be 40,000 years before it comes close to another star system.“What this project has shown me is that we can’t really control the impression we make,” said Orchard. “I think the fact of the satellite itself will do a lot of the talking. I would hope that the mere fact that we’ve endeavoured to send a record of humanity shows something about our humanity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff15b9bdd55db0e51b19d249e82135e1fe408ce/138_148_5198_3119/master/5198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba488a1224db52910198888f01aedd6","title":"gay trans teachers network lgbted section 28 anniversary","story":"Event for new support group, LGBTed, coincides with section 28 anniversary and aims to create role models in schoolsA gay teacher who fought back against advice to keep his sexuality secret by coming out in front of his whole school last year has set up a network to encourage other LGBT teachers to do the same.Daniel Gray will launch the initiative, LGBTed, next weekend at an event where more than 100 teachers, school leaders and other educationalists will share advice on being gay or trans role models in schools. It is being supported by Nick Gibb, the schools minister, who came out to his family as gay three years ago having been in a relationship with his partner, now husband, for 29 years.At the event, which will coincide with the 30th anniversary of section\u0026nbsp28, the notorious piece of legislation that banned local authorities from “promoting homosexuality”, teachers will receive training in being LGBT advocates and tackling homophobia.“The aim is to be the role models we needed when we were at school,” said Gray, who co-founded LGBTed to provide support to teachers. “I remember being at school during section 28 and I remember how horrible it was to be bullied the way that I was. I was told by my teachers it’s just something that you have to deal with.”Until February last year Gray had not discussed his sexuality at work, but to mark LGBT history month he came out to more than 1,000 students at a school assembly. “Most didn’t bat an eyelid. There were no cheers, no drama or anything like that,” he said, but it delivered a crucial message. “Young people who I’d never spoken to before started approaching me and having conversations with me. One student came over to me and said ‘oh my God sir, your assembly changed my life’, and scuttled away. It’s little moments like that that you don’t get in your career if you don’t open yourself up as a visible role model and lead by example.”Teaching is behind many other professions in supporting LGBT equality, said Hannah Jepson, co-founder of LGBTed, who added that schools were still recovering from the legacy of section 28. “There’s still a taboo where people conflate sexuality with sex,” she said. “Also the education sector is so big and there are so many different areas – you’ve got teaching schools, academies, local governments. It’s certainly not a system that’s working cohesively together.”Gray said he had received the support of his headteacher, colleagues and the vast majority of parents – but that not all schools were as inclusive.The experience of LGBT staff varies widely, according to David Weston, chief executive of the Teacher Development Trust and an advocate for LGBT teachers. “I heard the other day about a headteacher who said, ‘I was going to announce my same-sex marriage to colleagues but the local authority, said oh no I don’t think you should do that’. I was recently contacted by someone who is on initial teacher training who was told quite explicitly, ‘don’t mention anything, you’ll cause yourself problems’. It’s definitely a mixed picture still.”Gibb, who will give a video address at the launch, praised the event. “Through initiatives such as the leadership equality and ersity fund, we are supporting schools to increase the ersity of leaders,” he added.• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

To Froome, each one will feel like a fresh victory parade. He will also become the first man in 35 years to hold all three grand tours – the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and the Giro –at the same time, joining Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx in the pantheon.Whatever you think of the 33-year-old, who some believe should not be here after his failed test for salbutamol last September, that is some company to keep.“It is a very special victory,” said Froome. “I know it is not over until Rome tomorrow but the battle is over now. It is an incredible feeling.”Froome has been loudly applauded by crowds throughout the Giro, especially at the Sky team bus before the start of each stage. However, three kilometres before Saturday’s stage finish here, a man in a white top and red shorts appeared to come out from the crowd and spat at him.While Froome appeared not to respond, his Team Sky team-mate Wout Poels turned around in shock.That was the only negative note on a day when Froome confirmed his stunning turnaround in the race after struggling to cope with a crash before the first stage in Israel.In theory, Saturday’s penultimate stage, 214km from Susa to Cervinia, possessed enough teeth to make Froome fear its bite. The last 90km packed in three climbs, each amounting to nearly 20km in duration – with 4,000m of rise and fall along the way. Yet Froome was only rarely tested and never troubled.While the Spaniard Mikel Nieve – who was freed from the duties of supporting his Mitchelton-Scott team leader, Simon Yates – pulled away on the final climb to celebrate his 34th birthday with a stage win, Froome was content to keep a watchful eye on Tom Dumoulin, his only realistic challenger who started the day 40 seconds behind.There was plenty of watching. Up and down the Col Tsecore and then the Col St-Pantaléon, Dumoulin was impassive, content to pin his hopes on an attack on the final climb up the Cervinia. However, by then Team Sky had got to the front of the pack and were pushing the pace to make it hard for anyone to attack.Dumoulin did his best. With six kilometres to go he attacked three times in rapid succession, testing Froome’s legs, only to find them strong. He then went again three kilometres out but the Briton not only responded but attacked himself – a definite and defiant show of strength.“I gave everything I had,” said Dumoulin. “It was a real cool three weeks but I am glad it is over. He was too strong for me. I have no regrets. I gave everything I had.”Froome, meanwhile, knows there will be some that question this victory. Not only because of Friday’s stunning 80km solo breakaway, but the way he has looked so strong in the final week.Team Sky insist that he was more seriously injured than they let on when he crashed in Israel and that he came into the Giro a little heavier than usual, at 70kg rather than at the 67kg he is normally at the Tour de France. He also had saddle sores, which made riding more painful than he would have liked.Froome also denies any wrongdoing after double the permitted levels of the asthma drug salbutamol was found in his body at the Vuelta a España last September – a story first revealed by the  and Le Monde in December, yet to some it has left a sour taste that he has continued to ride while fighting a potential ban.There are no doubts that he looked stronger than ever towards the finish. Indeed, as he made his way over the steepest stretch of the final climb, just before Valtournenche about three kilometres before the finish, he powered clear of Dumoulin. As he did so he passed bunches of pink Giro d’Italia balloons, some of which had been popped.A few days ago, Froome looked similarly deflated. Once again he was able to deliver when it mattered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c88a40baaafe69ac78bd56e5facc8aba9466b33/0_445_5330_3198/master/5330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a8c57c6c04b23dd1da31a55b255ef4","title":"daniel ricciardo takes monaco f1 pole from vettel with hamilton third","story":"Daniel Ricciardo secured pole position for Red Bull at the Monaco Grand Prix after utterly dominating on the streets of Monte Carlo, with the Australian proving to be the class of the field in a Red Bull that has truly found its form on this circuit. Sebastian Vettel in the Ferrari was second, with Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes in third.Ricciardo put in the culmination to what has been a superb weekend thus far by delivering a flawless and superb run on his first lap in Q3 that was a full four-tenths clear of his rivals. It was a masterclass in Monaco and although he could not improve it on his second run, he did not need to. Vettel could only close the deficit to two-tenths, with Hamilton four-tenths back.Ricciardo had gone quickest in Q1, four-tenths up on Vettel, and was again in the second session but only one-tenth up on Kimi Räikkönen behind him. It had looked tight going into the shootout but the Australian proved untouchable. He has topped every session in practice and qualifying, and in doing so set a new track record on six separate occasions.This is Ricciardo’s second career pole position, having taken his first here in 2016, a race he was set to win until a pit-stop error cost him time and left the Australian angry and disappointed. It was also the last time Red Bull claimed the top spot and Ricciardo, out of contract at the end of this year, is highly bankable on current form. He won with a fine drive in China and was in good shape at Baku before the accident with team-mate Max Verstappen that ended their race.He has not won in Monaco but has been on the podium here on three of his four visits with Red Bull, and it is a race he has been clear he dearly wants to win. He was hugely strong in practice, quickest in the opening two sessions and then topped the table on Saturday morning, and will be optimistic of his chances of converting pole into a win.The Red Bull has yet to have a chance to show its real race pace in clean air at the front from the off, and Ricciardo will expect to exploit his opportunity on a circuit where track position is all. Always strong through the slow corners, the downforce-dependent nature of Monaco plays to the Red Bull’s strengths and masks its power deficit. The aero upgrades they brought to Spain have proved crucial and will have been targeted at this race.Having started last season well off the pace of Ferrari and Mercedes and coming after Ricciardo’s win in China, this strong showing in Monaco will buoy the team: they have proved adept in the past at making the most of any opportunity and will look to do so again on Sunday.Mercedes had opted to try to set their time in Q2 on the harder ultrasoft tyres, the only team to do so, but Hamilton described them as “terrible”. They were almost a second a lap slower than the hypersoft tyres and Mercedes had to run on the faster rubber to make it into Q3.Ricciardo’s team-mate Verstappen had another difficult start to his weekend, however. Having crashed three times across three visits to Monaco, he once again put his Red Bull in the wall in final practice, an incident almost identical to his accident in qualifying in 2016. The team had to replace the gearbox for which he would have taken a five-place grid penalty but they were unable to do so in time for him to take part in qualifying and he will start from the back of the grid.Räikkönen was in fourth, with Valtteri Bottas in fifth. McLaren’s Fernando Alonso was in seventh place. The Force India’s of Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez were in sixth and ninth respectively, with the Renault of Carlos Sainz in eighth and the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly in 10th.Romain Grosjean in the Haas was in 15th place but will take a three-place grid penalty after causing an accident at the last round in Spain. Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in 11th in front of the McLaren of Stoffel Vandoorne.

The Chiefs are not prone to panic or veering off script, but Sarries knew what to expect and when they did secure possession, it took them a couple of minutes to score a try.Owen Farrell’s chip behind the onrushing defence was seized by Alex Goode. Saracens exploited a narrow defence to move the ball wide and then turned to power: the Vunipola brothers and Maro Itoje drove to the line before Billy Vunipola scored his first try in a season badly disrupted by injury.Saracens showed more variety in attack than Exeter. The England head coach, Eddie Jones, was among the spectators and he watched Goode, a full-back he has turned his back on, stand at second receiver and make an arcing run outside Farrell which drew the defence in and gave Chris Wyles, who was making his final appearance for the club, space on the left wing.Wyles’s second try, seven minutes after the restart, was the result of another swift handling move. Exeter struggled to achieve width, sucked into an enveloping defence with Saracens waiting for the moment to compete for the ball on the ground, and had used six of their replacements within 11 minutes of the restart.Exeter were unbeaten in their previous four league meetings with Saracens and they never lost belief. They had struggled up front until changing their front row and they used a scrum penalty after 58 minutes to force an attacking lineout. They drove a maul to the line and when it collapsed, Schalk Brits, who had been on the pitch for six minutes in his final match for Saracens, was sent to the sin-bin. Exeter forced another lineout: Dave Ewers was held up over the line but Gareth Steenson, the match-winner in last year’s final against Wasps, scored from the resulting scrum after using Olly Woodburn as a decoy.By the time Brits returned, Saracens had not only kept out Exeter but increased their lead through a Ben Spencer penalty. The Chiefs had been lassoed and Sarries were able to bring off Wyles five minutes from the end to receive an ovation from the crowd, along with Mako Vunipola, who in his 32nd match of a season that followed the Lions tour had got through the work of two players.Wyles’s replacement, Nathan Earle, had the final word after another Goode loop and pass to create a winning scoreline that did not flatter Saracens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fd8cc843756ca1f47ae0634e571698240ad5c28/90_87_1906_1143/master/1906.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b42a8efffaf8c28ab259b52eed2fe1f","title":"mika hakkinen monaco demanding formula one","story":"Formula One double world champion recalls the day his luck changed in Monte Carlo and how having fun on the track led to his first title in 1998“I have never forgotten what James Hunt said to me: ‘Remember, Mika, remember to have fun,’” recalls the double world champion Mika Häkkinen, relaxing on a yacht in Monaco beside the very car that enabled him to fulfil Hunt’s bidding. Häkkinen believes his win here 20 years ago, on the way to his first Formula One title, was the stand‑out performance of his career and that the drivers who take to the streets on Sunday still face the ultimate test in Monte Carlo.Hunt’s words had been delivered to an intense young Finn in 1991. By 1998, after a life-changing accident and some tough years in F1, he was finally able to do as the British champion advised and revel in his endeavour. “When I did the first test in ’98 I felt the car was fast whatever I did, turn or break, it did exactly what I wanted,” he says. “I told myself: ‘Now is the time. You can win the world championship’.”The car was the McLaren MP413, the first Adrian Newey had wholly designed for the team and it was a remarkable piece of machinery. At the first round in Australia Häkkinen and his team-mate, David Coulthard, completed their one-two finish by lapping every other competitor. By the time they arrived in Monaco, Häkkinen had won three of the opening five races.Now 49 years old, having retired from F1 in 2002, he has lived in the principality for 25 years but back then he feared he was jinxed never to win the grand prix here, having suffered a series of retirements and accidents at previous races. However, with Newey’s world beater beneath him, he believed his time had come.Häkkinen began the serious business of the weekend with an exceptional qualifying lap to take pole. He always disliked understeer, preferring the car to have front-end bite he could throw at an apex, while catching and recatching the rear. On his final run in Monaco he deliberately braked early on a short, downhill section of track into the first corner, Sainte Dévote. This pitched the car’s weight forward and brought his tyres to their operational temperature immediately. It worked brilliantly, he had the front-end grip he wanted and he exploited it with “maximum attack”.In the race that followed Häkkinen was hounded by Coulthard until the Scottish driver’s engine gave out and, after putting in a series of perfectly executed laps, he left the Benetton of Giancarlo Fisichella and Michael Schumacher’s Ferrari squabbling for second in his wake.It had not been easy. “The track is very demanding physically and psychologically,” he says. “It take a lot of energy to stay calm, if you are panicking, you are in the wall. That’s why preparation is harder than anywhere else.”Now a brand ambassador for McLaren, he cites the team’s diligence and forward thinking as having saved the day. They had brought in new, stronger wishbones after qualifying – enough to withstand the blow.Four victories followed, the last in the season finale, at Suzuka, where he sealed the title. His second followed the next year, yet now at the top, he viewed his future with the perspective of a man who had already almost lost his life.In 1995, during first qualifying for the Australian Grand Prix, Häkkinen suffered a tyre failure that caused him to crash violently. He was severely injured and saved by an emergency tracheotomy at the side of the track. He remained in critical condition and was in hospital for two months. That he recovered to drive again the following year was remarkable but the incident had left its mark. “When I won the world championship I thought: ‘Don’t push your luck any further, this is good, now do something else,’” he says.He has since pursued a variety of business interests including a newly launched social media app.In Monaco this weekend, standing beside the car that was instrumental to his first title, Häkkinen describes Newey as a genius and believes his car – the Red Bull – will be the class of the field again. “He has always been a great designer of downforce cars and Red Bull have a good chance to get the victory here,” he says. But he knows how hard that will be in a race that requires an “incredible level of concentration”.A tough task then but one the flying Finn has only reason to remember affectionately. “Monaco is the best grand prix on the calendar,” he says, smiling. “When I take my children to school and we are exiting the tunnel I say: ‘Ah, sometimes I used to be coming out of here at 300kmh ...’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1389cf80523fae36dd89a05eeac73e0ea32873a6/0_56_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dacf1aaf6f4f566515b0671ca8dfc51c","title":"plan fix sri lanka england test al jazeera galle","story":"Sri Lanka Cricket has pledged to cooperate fully with anti-corruption officers as the sport awaits the broadcast of an investigation by al‑Jazeera that is understood to allege details of a plan to fix England’s first Test match in Galle this November.Some footage from the documentary Cricket’s Match-Fixers, which will be televised on Sunday, has already been made public, which allegedly reveals the groundsman at Galle telling an undercover reporter he can tailor the pitch to produce a specified outcome for betting purposes. This is understood to have been alleged to have taken place before two previous Test matches in Galle, too: Sri Lanka versus India in July last year, where the tourists amassed 600 in their first innings on a pitch made to be a batting paradise, and against Australia in August 2016, when the visitors lost in two and a half days on a deliberately turning track.The International Cricket Council has already opened an investigation but also made public some frustration that the information shared by al‑Jazeera to date has been limited despite “repeated requests” for full disclosure before the programme is televised.A statement from Sri Lanka Cricket said: “SLC will extend its fullest cooperation to the ICC to investigate the latest allegations levelled via media reports over ‘match fixing’. SLC wishes to state that it has zero tolerance towards corruption and will take immediate action against any person involved in the alleged incident, if found guilty.”Morris has since denied any wrongdoing and claimed he thought he was auditioning for an acting role in a movie “for public entertainment only”, while Indika has said he was simply being courteous to foreign tourists and is similarly not corrupt.England’s winter tour to the island, in which they will play three Tests, five-one-day internationals and a one-off Twenty20, has already drawn the ire of the Barmy Army. The supporters’ group and travel company have accused Sri Lanka Cricket of “blatant profiteering and short-sighted greed” over proposed ticket prices for the Test series.The company’s latest information is that while local fans will be able to buy tickets on the grass banks for £1.41 a day those travelling are to be charged just under £50 a day for seats provided they book for the entire match, with no refund policy should it finish early.The Barmy Army website states: “This blatant profiteering and short-sighted greed does nothing to enhance Sri Lanka as a cricketing destination and ultimately we feel it is likely to do damage to the country’s reputation as a reasonably priced general tourist destination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f59f174fe627602d7afeb8dbdadff40b3ee3f80f/274_199_3787_2273/master/3787.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980e1e691d96d58d196c1a47a2f49e94","title":"england v pakistan first test day three live","story":"65th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) Bess lives dangerously against Shadab, surviving an LBW shout as he misses the googly, and then prodding at thin air when the leg-break arrives. But he survives. Confident, plucky, resourceful, a fizzing fielder: there have been worse picks, and that’s just among the fringe spinners.Hugh Odling-Smee has a retort for Gary Naylor (64th over). “Well Michael was a better batsman than captain, so he would know.”64th over: England 189-6 (Buttler 44, Bess 36) England startle the crowd by going into the lead, thanks to another punchy cover drive from Bess, who adds a cut for four and a swat for three as Hasan offers too much width. These two have sailed past the rocks of total ignominy, but real hope is still some way off.And here’s Gary Naylor. “Dom Bess is reminding me of Michael Atherton’s rather terse description of Chris Schofield – ‘He’s a better batsman than bowler’.”63rd over: England 177-6 (Buttler 43, Bess 25) Shadab goes for a few comfy singles. The OBO’s loyal readers, like a few people in the crowd, may have nodded off.62nd over: England 174-6 (Buttler 41, Bess 24) Buttler plays another of his measured pulls for a single. Don’t the umpires realise that having drinks in mid-over messes with our system?62nd over: England 173-6 (Buttler 40, Bess 24) Buttler picks up two thanks to another misfield, in the covers, and the deficit is down to six. It’s not the end of the over, but there’s a suspicion that the ball is being changed for going out of shape, and that’s drinks. England are now flirting with respectability, but it’s surely too little, too late.61st over: England 171-6 (Buttler 38, Bess 24) Shadab returns with his leg spin, and when he tries a rare googly, Bess eases it for four to third man. He is beginning to look like A Find.Here’s David Acaster, joining the captaincy debate. “I would make the left bail captain,” he says, “if I thought it would restore Root’s batting.” Well, I know what you mean, but he’s making just as many runs as he was in the ranks – just getting to 50 all the time and 100 less often.60th over: England 166-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 20) Bess keeps out Mo Amir, in a way that his elders and betters could not, and then he plays the shot of his day, a delicious off drive, on the up, that brings a ripple of Lordly appreciation.59th over: England 162-6 (Buttler 37, Bess 16) A single to each batsman off Faheem, and a lovely flick-hook from Buttler, which goes for four on the strength of a misfield from Abbas. That was old-school Pakistan. And so the 50 partnership comes up, a credit to both batsmen, and to Ed Smith – the first time his bolder picks have come good.“Buttler captain?” splutters Simon Horbury, a propos the 56th over. “1. You’re having a laugh. 2. Might happen sooner than later.”58th over: England 156-6 (Buttler 32, Bess 15) Buttler clips Amir for a single, fearlessly handing him four balls to have a go at Bess, who has his sensible head on and survives.Tom van der Gucht is back for more. “Drastic times like this call for drastic measures,” he declares, “and I’d like to think I’m from the Ed Smith school of decisive action. Having given it some consideration, after this test has been completed I’d drop Malan, select Morgan and give him the captaincy, swap Stoneman for Roy and tell Bayliss to focus on the white-ball cricket and ask Farbrace to step up and coach the test team for the foreseeable future.” At the risk of sticking my neck out, I can’t see all of that happening. But Tom is right that something needs to be done about Stoneman, who looked lost today, and has already been sacked as the short-leg fielder.57th over: England 155-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 15) Bess wafts, for once, at Faheem, and gets a jammy four that might have been a catch to third slip. Sarfraz’s fault for going on the defensive when he’s right on top. That brings up the 150, and Bess’s first foray into double figures. He cashes in with a much better shot, a cover drive for four. The deficit is down to 24 now.56th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Amir comes round the wicket, looking for the killer reverse swing that Wasim Akram, who is commentating, brought to the 1992 World Cup final. And Buttler sees him off, happy to play out a maiden. Buttler has quietly manipulated the strike, facing 54 balls to Bess’s 33, without appearing to distrust him. Practice for the day when Buttler finds himself captaining England.55th over: England 147-6 (Buttler 31, Bess 7) Buttler takes a rather tight single into the covers, but gets himself out of a hole with a sprint. He and Bess have done what ministers can only dream of, and halved the deficit. Aha, here comes Amir.54th over: England 146-6 (Buttler 30, Bess 7) Buttler picks up another two and a one off Abbas, and in between he may be dropped behind by Sarfraz, who is standing up – a very tough chance as Buttler nicked an inswinger. Buttler has earned that with his positivity, and his unflustered fluency.I was just wondering where John Starbuck was, when this turned up. “Those of us who have followed England cricket for a while are not masochists, simply resigned. We know things have to get really bad before they can get better, so it’s just part of a very long cycle. I well recall my emotional state at Headingley 1981, so I know that Hope springs eternal. She’s a deity to whom our emotions are sacrificed.” Nicely put.53rd over: England 143-6 (Buttler 27, Bess 7) Sarfraz makes a change, but it’s Faheem, not Amir, who returns. Buttler picks up a couple with a leg glance off Faheem, and a single with a glide to third man. The game is suddenly feeling sleepy, although if any team can wake themselves up with a start, it’s Pakistan. “Afternoon Tim.” Afternoon Simon McMahon. “If Buttler can cut loose here and make, say, 149, giving the England bowlers, say, 130 to bowl at, then you never know I suppose. Though you do, really.” Ha.“Speaking of Cambridge,” says Ben Reilly, “as somebody who has a ticket for tomorrow and is currently at the Cambridge beer festival, I really hope for it to be over soon so I can get properly drunk without worrying about the morning.” Priorities.52nd over: England 140-6 (Buttler 24, Bess 7) Bess, getting a bit carried away, goes for a big cut off Abbas and misses, but recovers with a sensible push for a single. Buttler then gets a leading edge which pops up into empty space in the covers and brings him a streaky three.Here’s Tom van der Gucht. “I’ve been out for a pub lunch and spent some time sat in the sun, but I don’t think this game is over yet... If Buttler can tap into his IPL form and cream out a quickfire 150 backed up by Bess, Broad and Wood all cashing in with 30s against a tiring attack, we’d still be in with a sniff of a chance. Especially if Anderson could hang around for an obstinate 2-hour-long 12...” Well, that answers the question from the 44th over about dreamers or masochists.51st over: England 135-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 6) Dom Bess guides a two to backward point and moves to his highest Test score. Hasan responds with a feisty bouncer, which Bess does well to jag out of the way of, and a yorker, which he digs out. Well played the teenager.Robert Wilson is back, answering my question from the 46th over. “Which university, you say? Put it like this if you plough through the archives of Cambridge University’s august sporting records, you will find my name twice. Being the first soccer player to be sent off in their entire history is all very well but I think that getting sacked from the St Catharine’s Novices Rowing Eight for cheating on the dawn run to the river by taking a taxi was my finest moment.”50th over: England 133-6 (Buttler 20, Bess 4) A single to each batsman, off Abbas, and a clip for two from Buttler. There hasn’t been a wicket for a full eight overs. Sarfraz must be tempted to summon the extra snap of Amir.49th over: England 129-6 (Buttler 17, Bess 3) Buttler is seeing the ball well and getting a big stride in to stymie the swing.“Certainly England are not awful,” says Ram Prasad, “but young guns from Pakistan have come good in this match and 4 half centuries have hurt England a lot. Just that the impetus to propel the score when the chips are down, is lacking from Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes. Particularly Jos as he is red hot from a terrific IPL stint. Could he prove me wrong today?” I’m not sure impetus is what’s lacking, especially from those two – they both have tremendous energy. What’s been missing is nous, from the moment Joe Root declined to bowl first on Thursday morning.48th over: England 128-6 (Buttler 16, Bess 3) Bess finally comes to the party, albeit unintentionally, as, facing Abbas, he tries to withdraw the bat and gets a bottom edge to third man for three. They all count.“Desperate times, desperate measures,” says Jon Millard. “Can we still call up Chris Cowdrey?”47th over: England 124-6 (Buttler 15, Bess 0) After a wary start, Buttler finds his groove with a front-foot pull off Hasan, and celebrates with two fours through the off side – a glide and a cover drive. Given something to cheer at last, the crowd go wild, or as wild as they go at Lord’s.Here’s Dave Seare, with an email that’s more of a one-act play. “The phone rings at Lord’s.‘I’m sorry Sir, he’s just gone out to bat.’Tip your waiter, we’re here all week.”46th over: England 112-6 (Buttler 3, Bess 0) We have a run! Buttler hooks, or swats, Abbas for a controlled single to fine leg. Bess, again, keeps the straight ones out. He looks like finishing his first Test without any wickets, but he has shown a good temperament.“Dear Tim,” says Robert Wilson. “I’d hate to be guilty of reflexive Celtic Fringe anti-Englishness. I love you guys. You fed, clothed, housed and educated this particular Irish urchin. Then you sent me to your best university. Thanks a bunch. That was incredibly nice of you. And has confirmed my decided Anglophilia. So it is with great pain and deep sympathy that I point out that we are quite clearly MUCH better than you at Test cricket.” Nice one. So which university?However grim things get, we can always rely on Gary Naylor. “Writing a quiz recently,” he begins, classically, “I recalled that Zaheer Abbas made 240 at The Oval in 1974 (I was allocated locker 240 when I went to the big school soon after). In 44 years watching cricket, this feels as low an ebb as at any time since. 4-0, 58 all out, The 100 and now this.” So what do you reckon – have England been awful, or just not as good as Pakistan? Sarfraz and his young team have given the sort of performance that Jurgen Klopp is planning for this evening: an underdog masterclass. OK, they’re not up against Real Madrid. But England are strong at home, and normally formidable in May – they’ve never lost a Test that has started this early in the summer. Send us an email (and if you sent one a bit earlier, please send again to tim.delisle at gmail, as my  email is down) or a tweet.45th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Another maiden, from Hasan Ali to Dom Bess, who manages to play a solid straight bat to some naggingly accurate deliveries. And that’s tea. A moment that usually brings balm to an English brow, but here it’s more a case of rampant embarrassment. After England had finally had a good hour, Pakistan bounced back with a sensational one, taking four wickets for 19 in no time. England are minus 68 for 6, and the only doubt is whether Jos Buttler can bash a few defiant fours and make Pakistan bat again. 44th over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) A maiden from Mohammed Abbas to Jos Buttler, who was standing outside his crease to reduce the risk of LBW – so Sarfraz Ahmed came up to the stumps, adding sheer courage to his collection of strengths as a keeper-captain.“Why the doom \u0026amp gloom?” said Richard Morris, a few minutes ago. “Root will bat safely for hours, Buttler will survive comedy moment after comedy moment, we’ll have a lead of 150, 8 for from Sir James, Ed Smith will look like a genius, all is right in the world.” Are cricket fans dreamers, masochists, or both?43rd over: England 111-6 (Buttler 2, Bess 0) Well, this is a rout. And if it weren’t for Simon Burnton, you wouldn’t have heard about it because I’ve been having almost as many technical problems as England’s batsmen. Big thanks to Simon, and many commiserations to Ed Smith on finding, like a few others before him, that he has taken over a shaky ship.42nd over: England 110-6 (Buttler 1, Bess 0) Root has now got 10 half-centuries since his last ton. That was a fine delivery from Abbas, and given that he is the only Englishman to even offer some token resistance here it seems unfair to be overly critical, but that’s not so good. Anyway, here, finally, is Tim. Bye again!Pakistan think so, the umpire thinks so, and Root has to review it in the circumstances.41st over: England 110-5 (Root 68, Buttler 1) Hasan Ali is back. Root, whose innings has so far been exemplary, drives through the covers for four. A single gives Buttler half the over to deal with, and he is so committed to being unButtlerish that he leaves the ball whenever he can, even when he very nearly can’t - the last goes two inches wide of off stump, too close for comfort.40th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) Pakistan know that Buttler will do as Buttler does, so move three slips into position as Mohammad Amir takes aim. A maiden is the almost inevitable result. But the slips very nearly got some action, Amir’s final delivery a peach that tempts Buttler into a drive and zips just past the edge.39th over: England 105-5 (Root 63, Buttler 1) That is a ludicrous way to get out in this situation. That dismissal was so soft it was practically liquid. It was a gaseous dismissal. A damp fart of a dismissal. The question now is whether England can make Pakistan bat again.Stokes mishits, sends the ball looping apologetically into the hands of the man at midwicket. He hangs his head. He shakes his head. He takes his head back to the dressing room."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb06de338be235b860bcc59c542a96cc7b229bd/80_210_5020_3013/master/5020.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=540b364fd2cc45d51a7f660be7e7064d","title":"exeter chiefs v saracens premiership final live","story":"Saracens regained the title and secured their sixth trophy in four seasons after outplaying the champions Here you go.

This is the prize that everyone wants, finishing top doesn’t mean anything when it comes to these games.”And here’s Brad Barritt: “The beauty of this group is that we don’t make it about the championships, we make it about the process. I’ve no doubt next season the boys will come back as hungry as they have been in the last five. “It’s all about collective leadership.

They get their hands on the trophy for the third time in four years.The ball is hoofed out of play and Saracens win their fourth Premiership title.80 min: Spencer misses the kick but it matters not.79 min: And that’s that. Brits feeds Goode – who has been exceptional as well today – and he finds the replacement Nathan Earle all on his own out wide. He es over the line to spark scenes of celebration in the Saracens camp.77 min: Vunipola has indeed been named man of the match, and the bulk of the Twickenham crowd seem to agree. Sarries have a scrum close to the Exeter line but the teams are going through the motions to some extent now.76 min: The superb Mako Vunipola hobbles off for a well-earned rest. Could be a contender for man-of-the-match, along with Itoje.74 min: Saracens calmly go through the phases and play a bit of risk-free rugby to run down the clock. They’re still making yards though.72 min: Exeter require two tries then, and Saracens are back to full strength with Brits unleashed from the sin-bin.71 min: Rhodes goes for the line but is just short. Sarries have a penalty though and they take the points in front off the posts.70 min: An exchange of kicks sees Sarries on the attack and threatening the line.69 min: Barritt, somehow, is fit to continue.68 min: Rhodes is tackled into touch and Exeter have a lineout inside their own half. There’s a stoppage, though, as Saracens captain Brad Barritt has an injury. He looks in a fair bit of pain.68 min: A big loss for Sarries – Farrell, who looks to have tweaked a muscle in his leg, is replaced by Marcelo Bosch.67 min: Mako Vunipola and Itoje are again dominant at the breakdown and force a penalty. The Exeter momentum comes to a juddering halt.66 min: So Exeter are back inside the Sarries 22 again. They just about claim the lineout and build from there.65 min: Whitten and Turner burst through down the right and all of a sudden Exeter have their tails up. Farrell gives away a penalty on halfway.The try-scorer sends a tricky swirling kick between the posts. Nine points the difference.63 min: From the scrum, Exeter send the ball to the left and Steenson opts to burst through himself for the score.62 min: Ewers goes for the line but a Saracens arm is underneath the ball. Wayne Barnes and the TMO concur and Exeter have to settle for a 5m scrum.61 min: Same again from Exeter. Kick for the corner, a lineout, a rolling maul … and this time the Chiefs go through a few more phases, spreading the ball left to right. Sam Simmonds slips a tackle and Exter are inches from the line …60 min: A kick for the corner, a lineout, a rolling maul … and Schalk Brits, of all people, is shown the yellow card for a infraction as Exter threatened the line. 59 min: Exeter coach Rob Baxter is being interviewed live on BT Sport. “What will be, will be,” he says rather uninspiringly.58 min: Exeter have a penalty advantage after Lozowski’s high tackle. Woodburn and Turner combine down the left and Exeter have the ball in the Saracens 22 for just about the first time. The attack breaks down and we go back for the penalty.57 min: The ball breaks loose and Exeter have possession once more. Again Saracens stand firm as the phases rack up.56 min: And predictably enough, Itoje forces a penalty at the breakdown.

Thanks for all your company today, we’ll be back for the final stage in Rome tomorrow.Froome speaks! “I felt very in control. I felt everyone had such a hard day yesterday that nobody really had the legs to go anywhere. This Giro has been brutal, when someone tends to have a bad day here it’s not just 30 seconds or a minute, it’s 10-15 minutes. You could see today Pinot was in trouble and Astana turned the screw, so for us it was just to keep an eye on Tom. I sprinted to the finish just to keep in front of everything.”Nieve stands atop today’s podium, and receives his very colourful spoils. “Happy birthday to you!” rings out of the loudspeaker.Here’s our initial take from today – and our man Sean Ingle will be penning more very shortly!Nieve on winning the stage: “After yesterday’s stage I definitely started to look forward today and I think we had a really good team right the way through, we’ve won plenty of stages now and we’ve had good cohesion throughout the team. I’m really happy to get the stage win.”Celebrations at Sky.Yep – Froome’s lead is confirmed as 46 seconds, for whatever it’s now worth.And to confirm the top three in the overall classification:It will surely stay that way. The only real surprise today was Pinot’s unfortunate meltdown, which put him right out of the reckoning from a great position.What a day for Froome and for British cycling, even if we shouldn’t count every single chicken, because tomorrow must still be seen out and there could yet, in theory, be a strange localised typhoon over his bike in Rome. He added a handful of seconds to his lead over Dumoulin, who had a go late on but just couldn’t put a concerted attack together and ended up effectively waving the white flag in the final few kilometres. A good effort from Dumoulin but it never, if we are really honest, seemed on.There was no recovery from Dumoulin and, barring an absolute disaster on the most straightforward of finishes tomorrow, he will be the first British winner of the Giro!I’m not sure Carapaz will have enough to put genuine pressure on Lopez. With just over 1km left for the key protagonists the overall standings are 1 Froome, 2 Dumoulin, 3 Lopez, 4 Carapaz.He is about to do exactly that.Gesink finishes second in the stage, behind Nieve – a great ride from him, especially as he had some problems towards the end.Now Richard Carapaz attacks with about 3km to go, streaking ahead of the peloton he’s fourth in the standings, and started 47 seconds behind Lopez in third ... he couldn’t overtake him, could he?The biggest race is still being run though – in a few minutes we’ll find out if Chris Froome has, indeed, all-but won the Giro. Remember, tomorrow’s run around Rome is little more than a formality!Well deserved and very, very convincing from Nieve, who led with just under 40km to go and never looked back after that. Happy 34th birthday! It’s his fifth career win, his third in the Giro, and a great day for Mitchelton-Scott.“The comparison with Landis is innaccurate and unfair to Froome,” writes Joss Pinches. “Landis made his wunder-ride after a disastrous day where he lost a huge chunk of time, Froome was showing signs of strength the day before and had made the definitive attack which dropped Yates (sob) Landis won by 10 minutes, Froome by a little over three, a large part of which was on the descent, so yeah, they were both long-range and both propelled the protagonists into the lead, but beyond those superficialities the comparison doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.”2km to go: Dumoulin is still trying, still going, and his second place is more than secure – but he’s not surely going to overhaul Froome here even though he’s found his rhythm again after that little wobble.2.5km to go: Dumoulin is still going, whatever those difficulties were, but it seems as if his challenge is done. Froome has seen him off here, I’m sure of it!2.9km to go: Dumoulin goes away again as they enter a tunnel ... Froome responds yet again, and you can’t really fault the leader’s sharpness here. He’s ready for everything Dumoulin is trying ... and Dumoulin may be in trouble now ... he’s shaking his head!3.5km to go: This would be Nieve’s third-ever Giro stage win. And it doesn’t seem in much doubt.4km to go: Dumoulin and Froome are in a six-man group, led by Dumoulin’s team-mate Sam Oomen. Dumoulin has a word in Oomen’s ear, presumably demanding more pace. Froome isn’t really in any trouble at the moment after the brief excitement of that initial attack.And it’s getting real now! Dumoulin is streaking out, putting a little road between him and his rival, although Froome isn’t in real danger just yet.5.4km to go: Dumoulin has a glance behind him. He’s starting to go for this there’s so much work to do but he’s at least asking Froome a few questions.5.8km to go: Here we go! Dumoulin, followed swiftly by Froome, makes his move with about 9km left for the peloton. The race is on!6.5km to go: Mohoric, who we saw lead early on, has been overtaken by the peloton. They’re quickening the pace, that’s for sure, and eating into that gap behind Nieve – which is still 8min 43sec though.7.5km to go: Froome is comfortably tucked behind Sergio Henao, his team-mate. Sky know how to do this.8.6km to go: Surely Dumoulin will have a pop at this? Just so you aren’t too confused – he has rather more than 8.6km to go, he’s nine minutes behind Nieve. There’s time, but not lots.9km to go: Movistar, and particularly Richard Carapaz – fifth in the standings at the start of the day – are the team making moves at the front of the peloton now. Still time for a late attack somewhere.“This Giro has been so retro,” emails Matt Cast. “The breakaway yesterday was like Landis. And, like during the Armstrong days, we’ll be left with massive doubts over the winner of the race we’ve spent 3 weeks watching. I love this sport, but right now I’m almost wishing that I could give it up entirely.“The parliamentary report stated: ‘We believe that drugs were being used by Team Sky, within the Wada rules, to enhance the performance of riders, and not just to treat medical need,’ and that was before what happened at the Vuelta. There’s no denying the legitimate doubts and that is infinitely depressing.”10.9km to go: Robert Gesink is having issues – he needs a bike change, I think after an issue with his back wheel, and won’t stay in that chasing pack. Grosschartner is the man putting what pressure there is on Nieve now.12km to go: Absolutely no sign of Nieve losing this, currently. He’s going perfectly steadily and is well over a minute ahead of the trio behind.15km to go: Pinot is more than 20 minutes down now. It looks as if he is going to see this through but, my word, how disappointing for him. So much good work to get himself that high in the classification has been undone in one moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e8f23e7ea184b68e7b91cee2a3707f8033066c/0_131_5630_3379/master/5630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=330b4710fb37a4ccf0692f3d40a1c6c3","title":"20 best coastal seaside campsites uk britain england scotland wales","story":"From remote sea lochs to pitches in the dunes, these sites from new book Cool Camping: Coast, offer nature up-closePitches 40Good for Atlantic isolationOn the western foreshore of St Agnes, the southernmost of the inhabited Isles of Scilly, the farm’s meadows slip right down to the sea. Pitch on the water’s edge at the UK’s most south-westerly campsite, with Periglis beach (a shell collectors’ paradise) on one side and intriguing rock formations on the other. This is a dairy farm, with just nine milking cows, so indulging in the delicious homemade ice-cream from its shop is a must. At one-mile wide, it’s an easy walk across the isle – extend your stroll onto wild Gugh island at low tide when a sandbar walkway is revealed.• Pitch for two from £22 Pitches TwoGood for Private pitchesThis pocket-sized campsite on the Penwith Heritage Coast may have just two tent pitches but both are enormous and an adjacent 12-acre woodland, dimpled by small ponds, provides ample extra space to roam. As the name suggests, the campsite is entirely off-grid but there are sinks with mains water, composting toilets and hot, gas-powered showers. Walk the half-mile to sandy Portheras Cove or ramble inland to Watch Croft, the highest point in West Penwith. Local outdoor education company Future Tracks runs weekly bushcraft sessions on site.• Pitches for up to four adults from £270 Friday to Friday, £156 Monday-Friday, or £117 Friday-Monday Pitches 20Good for Cycling along the coastCapitalising on a prime location beside Cornwall’s Mineral Tramways coast-to-coast cycle trail, family-run Elm Farm first opened a bike-shop and cafe in 2014, before setting aside two meadows for tents and campervans. The success of the bike shop means the camping business is a lesser-known treasure and, with just 20 pitches, the site doesn’t get overcrowded. Campers get a discount so hire bikes and pedal south to Portreath beach or north to Porthtowan, each two miles away, while, inland, the cycle route takes in the quarries and copper mines of Cornwall’s industrial past.• Pitch and two people from £16Pitches 30Good for Getting away from it allThe last mile to Beryl’s, down cow-parsley-crowded lanes, is like a treasure hunt, aided by tiny white signs that end where a farm track begins. Yet, despite the hidden location and the shelter of trees in all directions, a hillside setting offers open views (and a scenic footpath) from the top paddock down to Start Bay. The campsite has a small pond, space for ball games and a barn-cum-facilities block with a covered picnic area for rainy days. Get up early for the chance to see resident deer.• Pitch for up to four people £24–£28 Pitches 100Good for FamiliesThe New Forest isn’t known for its coastline but, within the boundaries of the national park, this family-friendly, tent-only campsite occupies a supreme spot along its shore. Opened in 2017, the campsite is relatively basic – there are no electric hook-ups and the nearby beach cafe acts as an unofficial campsite shop – but it’s well organised and allows campfires. Watch sailing boats and Isle of Wight ferries from your tent or walk the 45 minutes to Exbury Gardens – a 200-acre arboretum with views across the river Beaulieu to Nelson’s former shipbuilding yards.• Pitch and four people from £32.50Pitches Max 12 peopleGood for Walkers and birdwatchersJust beyond a traditional Norfolk cottage and its garden, under trees and past upturned rowing boats, lies the tiny camping field. Only 12 campers are permitted at any one time and the shower and toilet room are attached to the back of the flint abode, where a couple of B\u0026ampB rooms are also available. Follow the coastal path for five minutes to National Trust-owned Morston Quay, a vast marshy tract of land where boats bob in and out at high tide and daily seal-spotting trips run to Blakeney Point.• Pitch from £12 for twoPitches 250Good for Rural feel close seaside townsDespite sitting on north Norfolk’s most populated stretch of coastline – three miles from Sheringham and one from Cromer – this family-owned campsite feels thoroughly rural and well hidden. Pass flint barns and hedgerows that brush your car on both sides, before the campsite looms into view. The final stretch, via a farm track, ensures children play safely away from roads. From the higher meadows, views of the North Sea are outstanding, while the bottom of the campsite has easy access into old fashioned East Runton village and the local beach. Still a working farm, spring lambs are in bouncy attendance, too.• Pitch for family of four from £17.50Pitches 48Good for Cliff-top walksWhile Scarborough’s Cleveland Heritage Coast steals much of the limelight, the quieter Flamborough headland, further south, offers more space and better birdwatching. In wondrous isolation, Wold Farm has turned over several of its sheep meadows to campers, with uninterrupted views to two lighthouses and a private footpath to the cliffs to look for puffins, gannets and skuas. For a longer walk, the nine-mile route along the headland takes in five spectacular beaches for a shorter one, head to the pub – there are four in Flamborough village alone.• Pitch for two from £14 per nightPitches 75Good for Lesser-known lakesWhile staying in range of the M6 is convenient, travelling across to the western side of the Lake District is worth the extra effort. Here three mountain-stream-fed rivers – the Esk, Mite and Irt – converge in a tidal estuary that’s a boon for walkers taking a day off from the fells. Wading birds pepper the mud flats, where boats sit at low tide, and Roman remains from days as a fishing port are visible inland. Ravenglass is the only coastal village within the park boundaries and this Caravanning Club campsite is well established, with comprehensive facilities.• Pitch for two from £20.80 Pitches 40Good for Wild dunes campingScattered among the dunes of seven-mile-long Druridge Bay, informal tent pitches at this almost-wild campsite are accompanied by off-grid shower huts, a fresh water supply and composting loos. Otherwise, facilities are sparse and there’s no lighting, save for your evening campfire. Flip-flop through marram grass to the sandy beach beyond, largely empty save for those who have walked the mile from nearby Cresswell, or bring bikes to make the most of immediate access to Northumberland’s Coast \u0026amp Castles Cycle route – magnificent Warkworth Castle, in particular, is a 40-minute ride away.• Pitch for two people from £15Pitches 10Good for SurfersArguably the best surfing beach in Wales, Blue Flag Whitesands beach on St Davids peninsula is no secret. But a few hundred yards inland, this new, five-acre campsite certainly feels like it is. There are just 10 spacious tent pitches – mown into long wild grass and ided by gorse and heather – with a picnic table, firepit and private loo at each. Rare breed balwen sheep watch you kindle the campfire from a neighbouring field, while kayaks, surfboards and beach gear are available to borrow.• Pitch for two from £33Pitches 15Good for Traditional, no frills campingA mile from the beaches at Broad Haven and Little Haven, this five-acre meadow is a delightfully homespun affair. There are four loos, a couple of hot showers and some washing-up sinks, plus half a dozen freezers for ice-packs, but very little else and, although small campervans are welcome, there are no electrical hook-ups. Wild grass surrounds mown pitches and logs are available for campfires. Walk the Pembrokeshire Coast Path or rent kayaks, surfboards and paddleboards from Haven Sports in Broad Haven.• Pitch for two from £20Pitches 30Good for Wales’ under-the-radar coastlineFrom Cardiff Bay to the seaside kitsch of Porthcawl, the Glamorgan Heritage Coast is surely Wales’ most unsung stretch of coastline. While summer crowds head to the Gower further west, this campsite acts as an ideal mid-way base on the spectacular, 35-mile Glamorgan coast path. Tent pitches spread across two grassy paddocks and there’s a renowned cafe. Follow the stream down to a shingle beach (bring a net for the countless rock pools) or walk the three miles west to sandy Dunraven Bay.• Pitch for two from £16Pitches 70Good for Great viewsAlthough there’s been a campsite at the foot of Conwy Mountain since the 1940s, new owners have cut back the static caravans and opened up the meadows so that more informal, tent camping prevails. A separate playing field is set aside for ball games, while newly refurbished facilities also feature free wifi. Wherever you pitch, the views are sublime (the name translates as “viewing point”). To the west – Anglesey, Puffin Island and the Menai Strait to the east – Llandudno and the Great Orme and to the south – the slopes of Snowdnia’s Carneddau mountains.• Pitch for two from £18Pitches 70Good for Endless space Known as “the edge of Wales”, the Llŷn peninsula is one of the more remote-feeling spots in the UK and worth the trek. Overlooking National Trust-owned Porth Ceiriad beach – a sheltered, south-facing stretch of sand that’s a popular launch spot for sea kayaks – Nant-y-Big campsite is vast. Check the weather forecast on arrival, then choose your spot – the sheltered main meadow (with electricity) if it’s windy or the beach-side fields if it’s calm with their superb views. There’s no danger of either running out of space.• Pitch from £18 for twoPitches 20Good for Highland solitudeOn a narrow Tarmacked track some eight miles from the nearest main road, Badrallach Campsite feels utterly remote. Though tents are pitched 100 metres back from the water’s edge, Little Loch Broom offers an enticing sliver of water on your doorstep, ideal for launching kayaks or the campsite’s wooden dinghy. Campfires are permitted and the shop has a good stock of midge repellent, thankfully. Mighty An Teallach, across the water, is a challenging hike for Munro-baggers (it has two distinct summits above 3,000ft). • Pitch for two from £12.50 Pitches 8Good for Superb wildlifeThe long drive to this remote outpost can now be shortened thanks to a new ferry from Ardrossan to Campbeltown. Birdlife is abundant, seals frequent the Kintyre shores, while unobstructed views from your tent to Islay, Jura and Gigha are spectacular. Perched atop one-metre-high “cliffs”, campers can jump straight onto the white sands. Facilities are surprisingly modern given the sleepy pace of life – never has a campsite beside an A-road been so secluded.• Pitch for two from £15Pitches 10Good for Really wild campingTen miles off the west coast of Scotland, innovative Isle of Eigg was bought by the local community in 1997 and, along with a clutch of other eco-friendly credentials, today runs entirely off of renewable energy. Cars are not permitted but the local minibus can bounce you the four-mile length of the island to Cleadale in the north, set beneath a natural amphitheatre of pitchstone cliffs. The campsite is as wild as its setting – pitches aren’t the flattest and the dishwashing sink is outdoors – but the view across the Hebridean sound to Rum is spectacular.• Pitch for two from £12Pitches 20Good for Spotting otters and eaglesSmall, south-facing, on the Ardnamurchan peninsula, this is the UK mainland’s most westerly campsite. It has a wide range of pitches – from flat, neat, meadow-like spots with hook-ups, to waterside nooks close enough to feel the sea’s spray. Where they end the real fun begins, with seaweed-clad rocks to scramble over providing pools for the inquisitive. Facilities are functional, if not luxurious, and there’s a good shop in Kilchoan, less than a mile away. Climb the lighthouse at Ardnamurchan Point for views that better those at the campsite. Just.• Pitch for two from £18Pitches 15Good for ForagingAbove a sea loch on the Outer Hebridean Isle of Harris, this relaxing campsite is a perfect island base. Many, however, hardly leave the site. Pluck a fishing rod from the wall of the traditional Scottish blackhouse and tug some fruit and herbs from the communal polytunnel. The boat-landing cove is a perfect spot for evening campfires, where you can cook your catch to eat with the owners’ homebaked bread. Pitches are mown into the long grass or ided by dry stone walls and there are a couple of yurts for lazybones. • Pitch for two from £24All sites can be booked at coolcamping and feature in the new book, Cool Camping: Coast (RRP £16.95), available at bookshop for £14.41, including UK p\u0026ampp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cecdc043738e91561632fa9822476a60421e7e/590_476_3037_1822/master/3037.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31bee2535774eecb862b5df2a269b61a","title":"chelsea clinton vitriol flung at me","story":"The former first daughter on privilege, female leadership, dealing with critics, and how Trump ‘degrades what it means to be American’When the American media describe Chelsea Clinton as royalty, they refer not to her popularity but to her ubiquity.

Ordinarily, it’s only young royals who grow up in lavish official residences and the pitiless media spotlight, a permanent presence in our consciousness. It is a uniquely strange and unenviable version of celebrity that stole Clinton’s anonymity before she was old enough to spell it.When we meet there is, therefore, a disconcerting sense of deja vu. Everything begins exactly as one might expect. On the previous day there had been the pre-interview call from one of her handlers, who was ostensibly warm and yet conveyed an impression of wary control, leaving me worried about how far I’d be allowed to stray from the subject of Clinton’s new book. The interview takes place at the Clinton Foundation, a vast but discreetly unadvertised expanse of midtown Manhattan office space populated by serious-looking people and elegantly adorned by African-inspired artwork chosen by Clinton’s father. Clinton is waiting in the glass boardroom the interview starts precisely on schedule, to the second.The 38-year-old displays impressive fluency in British current affairs, knowing all about the NHS’s missed mammogram test results, and praising David Lammy’s recent Windrush speech in the Commons. Her father once talked about the importance of really seeing people – the person who opens his car door, or pours his coffee – and I’m struck that Clinton notices the medical support sleeve I’m wearing, and asks about the origins of the name Decca. But any impression of intimacy is offset by a facial expression that remains glassily still, and a voice that never modulates. Clinton has inherited her mother’s unnerving composure, and speaks in monotone paragraphs consisting almost entirely of language no human being I know ever uses. “The choices that they made,” for example, “were fundamental to me feeling affirmed in charting my own journey”, which is not how anyone else talks about their mum and dad.Clinton has just published her third children’s book, and will be appearing at the Hay festival next weekend. She Persisted Around The World is a picture book in which she tells the stories of 13 extraordinary women through the ages, from Marie Curie to Malala Yousafzai, who persevered in the face of prejudice and changed history. It’s the sequel to her New York Times bestseller She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World, the title inspired by Republican senator Mitch McConnell’s scathing attack on Senator Elizabeth Warren for trying to read aloud a letter from Martin Luther King Jr’s widow in the senate. Warren was famously silenced, under an obscure senate rule that McConnell later defended with: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” only for his words to be swiftly converted into a feminist rallying cry.Clinton is completely right, of course. But later, listening back to my tape, I notice that when I say it feels important to me for my sons to know these stories, she responds with: “Thank you for framing it around both our daughters and our sons.” A few minutes later, when I tell her I took them to see Ava DuVernay’s A Wrinkle In Time, which features a geeky female protagonist who’s good at maths, Clinton replies: “I’m really grateful that you took your sons to see it.” Her odd construction of gratitude (most people would say, “Oh, well done,” or “That’s great!”) means that – even when we’re agreeing – it can feel hard to connect.She has talked in the past about inheriting her maternal grandmother’s “responsibility gene”, and mentions to me that her daughter’s nursery has been encouraging conversations about the concept of fairness. “It gives us the chance to talk with her about what is fair, and that she already has unfair advantages because of who her parents are. I don’t think she really understands the concept of privilege yet, but I want her to be able to understand that as soon as she’s old enough to. So we can start having larger conversations about privilege, and about the clear responsibility that comes with privilege. It’s also about kindness and respect.”My guess is that Clinton feels unable to say something as simple as “Oh, well done”, for fear of sounding superior. The unfortunate irony is that her thanks, intended to convey humility, end up making her seem either inauthentic or grand.It’s just a tiny glimpse into the lifelong impossibility of being Chelsea Clinton. At elementary school in Arkansas, her teacher called her precocious – “and it wasn’t meant as a compliment” – though her parents told her it was “a very good thing”. She’d begun reading newspapers when she was just four, “and my parents expected me to have an opinion about what I thought the most important stories were, and then to be able to muster an argument in support of what I thought was right or wrong. They taught me early on the difference between opinion and fact. A crucial distinction,” she adds dryly, “that seems to be not as appreciated at the moment by some, unfortunately.”Just 12 when she moved into the White House, an awkward adolescent jumble of frizzy hair and braces, Clinton was 18 when the father she idolised confessed to an affair with Monica Lewinsky. Two hundred and fifty journalists covered her arrival at Stanford University, where she was criticised for keeping a low profile, hidden away in her bulletproof dorm, but then criticised again for partying with celebrities when she moved to Oxford for an MPhil in international relations. She tried working for management consultants McKinsey, and then a hedge fund, but her heart wasn’t in it as she has said, “I tried to care about things like money. I just didn’t.”Following another master’s in public health she became a special correspondent for NBC, but was widely panned, one critic describing the decision to hire her as “journalistically bankrupt”. New York magazine ran the headline: “Chelsea Clinton at NBC: When Nepotism Goes Wrong”.The caution with which she parses my questions is therefore unsurprising. Now vice-chair of the family foundation, she seems to have found a public voice and role that fits, campaigning for girls’ empowerment, early access to childhood education and global healthcare initiatives – but even so, for the first half of the interview she sounds more like a policy paper than a real person.And then, quite unexpectedly, something changes. Feminist opinion is ided, I observe, between women who feel we should seize this #MeToo moment and go all out to tear down the patriarchy, and those who fear our rage will alienate support. Does Clinton still believe we should go high? She gazes at me in silence, as though making up her mind whether or not to become present, and when she opens her mouth it feels as if she is suddenly here.“For me, maybe because I’ve had so much vitriol flung at me for as long as I can literally remember, people saying awful things to me even as a child, I’ve never found it productive, personally, to engage in that way. To retaliate with crass language or insult someone personally – I just don’t think I’m built that way.”Does she tell herself they’re not really talking about her? “Oh, no,” she flashes back, with a low chuckle. “I know they’re talking about me. I just think that the way they’re talking about me, to me, to my face, online, is a reflection on them and not about me. The savagery that is directed at me, sometimes it’s because I’m just the person that they happen to see and recognise, and they’re angry, and so that anger kind of spills out. Sometimes they’re mad at me because of something that my mum or dad did, or something that my mum or dad never did – but they have been fed the narrative that they were trafficking children, or drugs, or some other heinous crime.”She used to believe the right thing to do about “all of the meanness” was simply ignore it, she reflects. “Now I’ve come to feel differently, because I think that the way that our president and many people around him have not only mainstreamed hate, but mainlined it, is so deeply dangerous.” Her eyes fill with dismay as she cites the rising reports of bullying in schools catalogued by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. “Not just the hundreds but now thousands of instances in schools across America, where children are citing the president as they’re demeaning a little girl, or they’re chanting ‘Build a wall’ in an attempt to demean and degrade brown children. So the reason, now, I no longer ignore it when people say hateful things to me on the street or on social media is, I think we have to shine a light. I think those of us who have platforms to do that have to say this is wrong and unacceptable, so we don’t normalise it but try to detoxify what has been unleashed. Because if we don’t, we leave a vacuum. And I think the darkness fills that vacuum.”I tell her a lot of people in Britain are wondering how they should receive Trump’s visit in July. What’s her advice? “Well, I’ve been to multiple protests since the election. Charlotte’s been to at least three, maybe four. Aidan’s been to one. If I lived in Britain I would show up to protest, because I don’t agree with what he’s doing to degrade what it means to be an American.”We are meeting two days after a smiling Ivanka Trump opened the US embassy in Jerusalem, as dozens of Palestinians were massacred. I ask if Clinton feels any sympathy for the first daughter, obliged to do her father’s grotesque bidding, or considers her complicit. Her expression hardens.“She’s an adult. She can make the choices for herself. I mean, she’s 36. We are responsible for our choices. In 2008 I was really proud to support my mum – but I disagreed with her fundamentally on a few things, particularly her then opposition to equal marriage rights for LGBTQ Americans. I never defended that position, because it wasn’t what I believed was the right thing to do.”Ivanka and Chelsea used to be friends, and seemed to have much in common: famous and powerful parents young families and busy jobs in Manhattan. In 2015 Clinton told American Vogue, “She’s always aware of everyone around her and ensuring that everyone is enjoying the moment. It’s an awareness that in some ways reminds me of my dad, and his ability to increase the joy of the room. There’s nothing skin-deep about Ivanka.” The friendship somehow survived the election campaign, but not Trump’s presidency the pair haven’t formally fallen out, but Clinton says they haven’t spoken in “a long time”.Were Ivanka to succeed her father in the White House, as some have speculated, would the election of the first female president still constitute a triumph for feminism? “Well, I didn’t support Sarah Palin when she was the vice-president nominee in 2008. And I hope my son is as much a feminist as my daughter. I think it is more about what we stand for, and how we do it, than the gender of the person there.” With the exception of Barron – “He’s 12 let him be 12, please” – she has no sympathy whatsoever for Trump’s children. “They’re adults who’ve made the decision to work in this administration.” Had her mother been elected, she says she would never have gone to work for her, so I ask if she shares others’ distaste at Trump employing his family.“I think the president should be able to hire whoever he or she thinks are best qualified. I do not believe that many of the people that he has hired have been qualified to do the jobs. Not only do I want an administration that isn’t venal, corrupt and focused on making life harder for millions of Americans, I also want a competent administration. So for me, the larger question is the collision of cruelty and incompetence and corruption that we see across the administration.”Given her father’s track record, I’m curious to know how she would feel if Stormy Daniels were to take down the presidency. “I haven’t followed that as closely as I have everything that’s emerging around the Russia investigation. But I do think it’s important that no one is above the law, and so whatever investigations come out of what Mueller’s doing, or the other ways in which many people are attempting to hold the president accountable, I think it’s important that those continue.” Following the scenes in Charlottesville last summer, she must have considered the danger of violence if Trump’s supporters feel he is unduly hounded out of office. The spectacle of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Klansmen marching through the Virginia town last August, bearing torches and swastikas, sent shockwaves through America and cost one counter-protester her life. When Trump declared there were “fine people” marching on the Unite The Right rally, to many frightened Americans the nation’s politics felt profoundly and ominously altered. Just how febrile does Clinton consider the situation? She looks grave. “Quite, I think.”Her assistant announces that our time is up, and I turn my recorder off, but Clinton tells me to turn it back on. Now that she’s really here, she wants to keep talking.Since Barbara Bush died, she says, she’s thought a lot about the importance of intentions. “I disagreed with her husband on so much, and with her on so much. But I also never doubted that she believed what she and her husband were fighting for was going to be to the benefit of most Americans. She really believed that what they were doing was the right thing to do.“I used to believe all that mattered was the bottom line of the outcome, like, how many lives were improved, how many people were saved, how many more people got to go to school without debt, how many people had healthcare, how many women got to have paid maternity leave. I still believe that is what matters most. But I also now believe that intentions and tone and decency matter, because I think the wreckage that we’re seeing at this moment is one that will, I hope, be repaired on the policy standpoint when we elect Democrats. But I think we will still then have work to do on repairing the tone in our country, the exposure of the real racist and sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and antisemitic feeling which is on the rise in our country – a rot that has been exposed.”We are well over time now, and I glance at her assistant, but Clinton hasn’t finished. “I think one of the big mistakes,” she continues, “was, for so long, we focused on tolerance, which I just think is insufficient. People tolerated casual misogyny, but casual misogyny is maybe the gateway drug. We have freedom of speech, which I do think is hugely important – and yet people thought you couldn’t dispute hateful things, because they’re like – well, it’s freedom of speech. Well, freedom of speech doesn’t mean there is freedom of consequences.“Sure, you should not be in prison because you said something racist. But you also shouldn’t be able to run for president. And yet here we are.”She Persisted Around The World, published by Philomel Books, is available at the  bookshop for £9.99 (discounted from £12.99).

We have nothing to do with it whatsoever. This is the inner matter of the UK,” Putin said.“And I guess we can suspect that those who wanted the UK to leave the EU are Russian agents,” he added, noting that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was among those campaigning to leave the European Union.“If they want to worsen their relationships with Russia they can blame all their mortal sins on us and this is actually the case nowadays,” Putin said. “Brexit, and Catalonia and the Skripal case, God knows what – and this plane again.”Putin’s comments to the heads of international news agencies on the margins of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, follow a statement by Johnson backing international demands for Russia to be held accountable for the fate of MH17, the Malaysian Airlines flight downed over war-torn eastern Ukraine nearly four years ago killing all 298 people on board. In a statement, Johnson said the incident, which claimed the lives of 10 British nationals, was “an egregious example of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent life”. “The Kremlin believes it can act with impunity,” he said. “The Russian government must now answer for its actions in relation to the downing of MH17. “The UK fully supports Australia and the Netherlands in their request to the Russian Federation to accept state responsibility, and to cooperate with them in their efforts to deliver justice for the victims of this tragedy. “Instead of seeking to undermine the investigation through the deluge of disinformation we have seen from Russia about MH17 in the past, the Russian Federation must fulfil its obligations under UN security council resolution 2166 to provide any requested assistance to the investigation. “To do otherwise would be a violation of the UN’s resolution, and to deny the families the justice they seek for their loved ones.” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the MH17 findings, saying Russia had been barred from taking part in the investigation and did not trust its results.The Russian defence ministry said the missile “more than likely” came from Ukrainian arsenals.

She was anxious. “I kept telling myself don’t worry, relax, have a good night’s sleep and a fresh start tomorrow.” Her husband, a doctor, was on a night shift, so she was alone. At about 1am, her son started to cry. While holding him, she also burst into tears.“He was crying and I was crying,” she said. At that point, Liu decided she would never have another child. “Thank you, family planning. One is definitely enough,” she said.For decades, from the late 1970s, China’s one-child policy barred many couples from having multiple children. Over the past five years, the country has been phasing out that policy, making new exemptions and eventually allowing all parents to have two children. Now authorities may be considering lifting limits altogether. But experts say the change is unlikely to much affect the country’s demographic direction. Prohibited by the high costs of education, housing and childcare, few Chinese couples actually want more than two children. Even under the two-child rule, few have chosen to have more than one.“Even if our government lifts the limits on how many children a family can have, I don’t think there will be a big increase of newborns,” said Wen Xi, 28, head of marketing at a radio station in Beijing. “Feeding ourselves is hard enough, let alone feeding a new life.”She has decided to spend her energy and money on herself and her mother, who raised Wen on her own.It was reported this week that China’s state council, its cabinet, had commissioned a study on the impact of scrapping restrictions on family size, a move that could happen as soon as this year. It would mark an end to one of the largest social engineering experiments the world has seen, one that many regard as a mistake. Today, China faces an ageing population with little social support, a shrinking workforce and one of the world’s lowest fertility rates.“It is just another historical policy blunder that the government, perhaps society as well, would like to erase from memory quickly. But this one will not be easy,” said Wang Feng, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine.Liu, for example, has been resisting her mother-in-law’s calls for another grandchild. “From the day my son was born, we were competing with other parents on what kind of milk powder he was drinking, what kind of instrument he would learn, which kindergarten was better, which primary school would be better, which tutor is better. All this competition is driving us and our son crazy,” she said.More young, professional women want just one child or none at all. “Definitely not,” said Wei Teng, a cultural studies scholar based in Guangzhou, on whether she would consider a second child. Even if couples were willing to have more children, the cohort of Chinese parents today is small. According to Yong Cai, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, China experienced a “baby bust” in the 1990s, a decade after the one-child policy was implemented. At the end of the 1980s, the number of births a year was about 28m by the mid-1990s it had dropped to 18m.“We have fewer people having children, so the number of new births will continue to decline no matter what,” Yong said. Now we were seeing “the echo of that baby bust”, he said. China’s family planning limits have been maintained through forced abortions and sterilisations, and steep fines. Some joke that Chinese authorities will deploy its interventionist methods to encourage the birth rate. An image of one of China’s iconic red propaganda banners, doctored to say “If you don’t have children when you should, we will push you to become pregnant”, received more than 6,000 likes after it was posted online this year. It is already common for managers in the private sector and academia to refuse female applicants. Many companies prefer to employ women who have already had one child, safe in the knowledge that their child-rearing days are over. “If the Chinese government does not enforce protections on female employees, companies will have more reasons to turn down female candidates,” said Emily Zheng, an academic based in Beijing who studies popular culture.Still, loosening family planning restrictions has already had a positive impact at the micro-level, on inidual families. Ning, 34, who works at a bank in Hangzhou, remembers when his mother became pregnant in 1989 with what was then known as an illegal second child. Afraid that neighbours would report her to family planning controllers who would force her to have an abortion, Ning’s mother hid in a nearby village. When Ning’s little sister was born, his parents, both farmers, paid their life savings in fines, the equivalent of about $100.In 2015, Ning found himself in the same situation. His wife was expecting another child after already having a girl. They considered an abortion but heard there might be a loophole. For months the couple shuttled between government departments. A few months before his wife’s due date, they were little more than halfway through applying for the exemption when China announced all parents could now have a second child. “All our problems were gone. All we needed now was proof that my wife was pregnant, that’s all, and then we waited for our second child. We felt really lucky.”Ning said he and his wife were unlikely to have a third child. “Having two kids is enough for us,” he said.

Moon Jae-in crossed into the north at the border village of Panmunjom, where the two met for the first time in April, the South Korean president’s office said. The two leaders discussed the potential US-North Korea summit, as well as implementing the joint statement released at the end of their earlier meeting.The surprise meeting highlighted Moon’s efforts to get the historic US-North Korea summit back on track, and showed inter-Korea relations are in a far better state than those between Washington and Pyongyang. On Friday, Trump made a partial climbdown, saying the summit could still be held in Singapore on 12 June if conditions are right. On Saturday, Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders said White House staffers and state department officials would still travel to Singapore for a logistics meeting. “The White House pre-advance team for Singapore will leave as scheduled in order to prepare should the summit take place,” Sanders said in a statement.In a pair of tweets, Trump said there was “ZERO disagreement” within his administration about North Korea but “if there was it wouldn’t matter”. He also disputed a report in the New York Times about the issue. Trump has faced fierce criticism over his inconsistency as a partner in the high-stakes talks. Adam Mount, director of the Defense Posture Project at the Federation of American Scientists, said on Saturday Moon’s “bold but risky” meeting with Kim was a “clear demonstration of how dangerous Trump’s temper tantrum was”.“When Kim Jong-un was allowed to split the negotiations into separate tracks with Trump and Moon, he gained leverage over both,” Mount wrote on Twitter. “Moon was sitting too alone at the table today, without the full weight of the United States.“Trump says ‘everybody plays games’,” Mount added, referring to Trump’s response when asked about North Korea’s posture on Friday. “Moon Jae-in is not playing a game: he must keep his people safe from war. Each of Trump’s whims shakes the walls of the Blue House.”Photos released by the South Korean presidential office showed the two leaders embracing, shaking hands and holding intimate talks, accompanied by a single aide each. Moon was expected to announce further details on Sunday.In their first summit in April, Kim and Moon announced vague aspirations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and peace, which Seoul tried to sell as a breakthrough to set up the summit with Trump. But relations chilled as North Korea canceled a high-level meeting over South Korea’s military exercises with the US.The South was caught off guard by Trump’s abrupt cancellation of the Singapore summit, citing hostility in recent North Korean comments. Moon said Trump’s decision left him “perplexed” and was “very regrettable” and urged Washington and Pyongyang to establish “more direct and closer dialogue between their leaders”.Trump’s behaviour has fanned fears in South Korea regarding a rival intent on driving a wedge between Washington and Seoul and a US president who thinks less of a traditional alliance than his predecessors. The decision to pull out of the summit came just days after Trump hosted Moon in a White House meeting where he cast doubts on the Singapore summit and offered no support for inter-Korean progress.In his letter to Kim cancelling the summit, Trump objected to a statement from senior diplomat Choe Son Hui, who referred to vice-president Mike Pence as a “political dummy” and said it was up to the Americans whether they would “meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown”.North Korea issued an unusually restrained response, saying it was still willing to sit for talks with the US “at any time, (in) any format”. “The first meeting would not solve all, but solving even one at a time in a phased way would make the relations get better rather than making them get worse,” vice-foreign minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement carried by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency.Notably, the statement did not appear in Saturday’s edition of Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the ruling party. The newspaper focused on Kim’s visit to Wonsan to inspect a beachfront tourist complex. Analysts say Kim’s outreach after nuclear and missile tests in 2017 indicates he is eager for sanctions relief and international legitimacy. Earlier this month, Kim released three US citizens. This week, Pyongyang invited international journalists to observe what it claimed was the dismantling of its only known nuclear test site. The regime has also declared that it no longer needs to conduct tests.There is also skepticism whether Kim will ever agree to relinquish his nuclear weapons, which analysts believe he sees as his only guarantee of survival. Comments in state media indicate Kim sees any meeting with Trump as a negotiation between nuclear states. The North has said it will not participate if it is pressured to give up its arsenal.In Washington, a cadre of Trump’s most fervent Republican supporters in Congress have nominated the president for a Nobel peace prize. The Trump administration also issued an official but widely mocked summit commemorative coin, featuring profiles of Trump and Kim against the backdrop of their countries’ flags."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d92deecc53e9e562bef08b98798183a2ae8615/8_82_704_422/master/704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e8bf8b2e588a54c4e0dbfad8e64144","title":"syria idlib women children society","story":"With husbands, sons and fathers dead or missing, women have been unwittingly thrust into the spotlight. Their resilience and innovation could point a way forwardThe plight of approximately three million civilians encircled by hostile forces in Syria’s north-western Idlib province is growing worse by the day, according to UN officials, aid agencies and advocacy groups who fear a looming humanitarian catastrophe.For many Syrian families, Idlib is the refuge of last resort, after their forced displacement from homes in other parts of the country. But it also risks becoming a sanctuary without exits – what activists have termed a “kill-box” from which there is no escape. The Syrian army, backed by Russian and Iranian forces, is entrenched to the south and east.The route north is blocked by Turkish forces occupying Syria’s Afrin region. Along with Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, they have seized a crescent-shaped area around Idlib. The Turks last week set up “observation posts” ringing the province. For this reason, many refugees from the Damascus area have instead fled south to the rebel enclave in Dara’a. But a fresh government offensive is also feared there.As the last remaining province not controlled by Bashar al-Assad’s forces, Idlib is the gathering point for both opponents of the Syrian president’s regime and those who simply have nowhere else to go. But their situation is dire, with approximately 1.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.Residents of eastern Ghouta, outside Damascus, were bussed there after the besieged enclave fell to regime forces earlier this year. A similar operation took place last week, involving people from the Yarmouk refugee camp and Hajar al-Aswad, close to the capital.Idlib has also become a focal point for armed opposition groups, including an estimated 10,000 jihadists, many with links to al-Qaida, who control much of the province. Concern is growing that if Assad launches a final offensive, they may attempt a “last stand”, intensifying risk to civilians.Pressure on Assad to act is coming from Iran: an unsubjugated Idlib is a barrier to its plan for a land corridor to the Mediterranean via Iraq and Syria. After Ghouta fell, Ali Akbar Velayati, senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said Idlib was next for “liberation”.Russia is also pushing for an end to the seven-year conflict: this message was delivered in person to Assad by Vladimir Putin this month. Meanwhile, plans by Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from Syria, plus the ending of all US aid for Idlib, may be interpreted by Assad as a green light.Assad’s position was boosted last week when he finally achieved control of all areas around Damascus. The almost daily aerial bombardment of Idlib by Syrian and Russian forces is expected to be stepped up.The regime has repeatedly used chemical weapons in Idlib. Despite this attrition, a new report, Idlib Lives – The Untold Story of Heroes, by the independent advocacy group the Syria Campaign and the international anti-war organisation Peace Direct, paints an extraordinary picture of creative resilience and innovation in the teeth of appalling adversity – and at a time when the UN says international assistance and aid has fallen to critically low levels.Many of these informal civil initiatives are led by women, who have been unexpectedly thrust into leadership roles by the war. This is due in part to the absence of fathers, husbands and sons, who are fighting, missing or dead, and to the breakdown of traditional societal conventions and taboos governing what women may or may not do.Overall, the Syrian conflict has disproportionately affected women and girls. In particular, extended control by conservative extremist groups has exacerbated the exclusion of women from leadership roles. But women in Idlib are pushing back. “Facing attacks from all sides, civil society in Idlib continues to operate with remarkable effectiveness and determination,” the report says. “In areas best-known internationally for massacres, there are untold stories of hundreds of groups providing the services civilians need to survive.”As much as any future peace settlement imposed from outside, these self-help initiatives point the way forward for postwar Syria, the report says. “Idlib’s civil society represents the best chance for free and democratic institutions … Idlib stands at a critical point, but if international politicians, donors, international NGOs and policymakers invest in civil society, we will see ideas and solutions flourish.”Mariam Shirout is manager and teacher at an after-school support institute for children. She is also a co-founder of the Syrian Organisation for Women and director of the women’s bureau at civil activist group Zoom In.“We do lots of activities with the students. Once we cooked together and distributed the food to low-income families.

A woman displaced from Damascus has been doing excellent work with clothes recycling. In the beginning, the community found it a bit abnormal to see a woman doing multiple jobs and going wherever she wanted. Now they are looking at me as a role model for other girls.“What we have been through has made us stronger. If people stayed at home to grieve, life could have stopped a long time ago. Life won’t stop: we need to keep going and working. I believe in working until the last possible moment.”Nora Halabi (not her real name) is project coordinator for the White Helmets (also known as the Syria Civil Defence) women’s centres. “The centres provide first aid and midwifery and specialise in women’s injuries. Their volunteers run awareness campaigns to prepare people for airstrikes and chemical attacks and give basic first aid and nursing training. Some of the centres are in caves some of them are fortified. We provide follow-ups with people injured in airstrikes and women who need C-sections in their homes.“When female volunteers started joining the White Helmets, the community was not accepting of the idea. But because we are able to offer crucial services that male volunteers can’t in our conservative society, such as caring for injured women and going into homes and schools, people started to realise the positive impact of our work. People now even want their daughters to join.“Safety is the major challenge we’re facing. Not all the centres are fortified, and some don’t even have basements, so are very vulnerable to airstrikes. Our centres are targets.”Raed Fares  is founder and chairman of media campaign group the Union of Revolutionary Bureaus (URB). Most of URB’s employees are women. They run six centres for teenage girls, 12 centres for children and the most popular radio station in Idlib.“When we opened the first women’s centre, it wasn’t accepted by the community. Now there are dozens of centres and it has become normal for women to work. People want their daughters to work at our centres. We face 100 problems every day. We’re working under circumstances only the mad can work under. But I’m happy this way. The more challenges that come my way, the more determined I become.”Anon runs an all-girls primary school for 100 local and displaced children. After being forced out of Darayya, a suburb of Damascus, and her school there, she opened one in Atmeh, on the Turkish border.“We had no other options for the kids who were displaced from Darayya with us. None of the schools here accepted them. We were promised a school would open in the camp, but it did not.“We provide books and notebooks. My students love to draw. I prepare arts and crafts projects for them on topics they cover in other classes. When they learned about the food pyramid in science, we drew it in art class.“There are no bookstores here to get stories from, so we get what’s available on the internet.“It’s difficult to find skilled teachers, so we’ve been running education workshops for teachers through trustworthy trainers. We hear feedback from the parents that their kids love school and don’t want to miss a single day, even when they’re sick. Some of the kids call me and other teachers Mama or Auntie.”Muznah is managing director for the Women Now Maarat al-Nu’man centre. She studied biomedical engineering at Aleppo University before starting a free education centre for women in 2014.“We have two centres in Idlib – an empowerment centre and an internet cafe for women. We have a daycare room and trained babysitters.“We started with a leadership programme, which includes a package of skills that prepares women to be in decision-making positions. Those skills have helped many women get work with local councils and civil organisations. Once a woman attends courses, she gains knowledge and makes friends. That alone is supporting and empowering her. My mother keeps telling me: ‘I see my dreams coming true in you.’“The woman who lost her husband needs to be the breadwinner for her children. For them, life still exists. We have the desire for achieving and being independent. When the community here can feel the positive impact of women working, they won’t push against them. “I know several women from the leadership programme who are working now and their husbands are staying at home with the children. Whether there is shelling or not, life will go on.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.17:12\t\t\t        Kitty Holland broke the story of Savita\u0027s death in November 2012.

In general I would have no difficulty with the thrust of most of legislation, like a lot of colleagues of mine in the Dáil.

Photograph: Cyril Byrne Yes, Yes, Yes. A resounding, emphatic Yes. And what a way to say it – the only way to say it: with conviction and clarity. This massive vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution leaves no doubt. The Irish people have taken ownership of their abortion issue. They have taken it out of the hands of unrepresentative lobby groups and celibate clerics and decided how they want to approach it.On Friday, with steely assurance, a new generation of all the generations faced down the suffocating old certainties and swept them aside. On Friday, May 25th, 2018, they stood up and were not afraid to be counted. Because those days are gone now.The official result has yet to be declared, but the exit polls point only in one direction, and it is going to be a monumental change and a major milestone in modern Irish history.You could feel it in the air in the last week of the referendum campaign. Something had changed and something big was about to happen. It was there in the faces of the younger people – out there agitating, unashamed to be seeking basic rights for Irish women, because they were in the right.It was there in the noncommittal comments of older men and women. People misinterpreted them as the words of No voters who didn’t fancy being ridiculed for bucking a liberal trend. Instead, they were merely keeping their counsel and waiting to have their say.Thirty-five years is a long time to wait for a isive and dangerous clause to be excised from the Constitution. But for those who waited decades to see those lines equating the life of a foetus from conception to its living, breathing mother, the 15 hours it would take for the nation to vote probably felt like a lifetime.There couldn’t have been a better day for a vote. The sun shone on the island, welcoming back the thousands of men and women who traversed the globe and returned to vote. The sight of them arriving at ports and airports with their “Repeal” jumpers and wheelie cases moved the most hard-hearted observers to tears.These were the children of the women who had no choice, returning home from far-flung places and bringing back the gift of choice.All day, up and down the country, the voters streamed into polling stations, exceeding turnout expectations from early morning. The huge number of young people, young women in particular, many with babies and toddlers, did the heart good. You could sense the mood of charge in their faces as they came into the polling stations, anxiously scanning the tables, eager to hand over their cards.“I was torn, but I voted for my daughters,” said one woman.“We were only exporting the problem,” said her husband.The Taoiseach voted in his local school in Castleknock. Scoil Thomáis was swarming with photographers when Leo Varadkar arrived.He said he was confident.“The lads at my gym all told me they are voting Yes.”Many more were in rural locations around the State. These were the men and women from the big international photo agencies, hoping to capture the image of Catholic Ireland voting away the vestiges of church authority from their private lives.The presiding officer in Knock had to tell them to leave. With its shrine and place as the pilgrimage capital of Ireland, they descended on the Mayo village in the search of voting nuns, but they were unsuccessful. They had been told there was a big mural of the Blessed Virgin in Knock, but that has been painted over. They were most annoyed.If the smiling women and the reticent men and the huge numbers voting in Dublin and other major urban areas was an indicator of rapidly gathering change, there were worries in more rural areas.“The voting is very brisk, but everyone is very elderly. I think they’re being bussed in. I’d be worried,” said an acquaintance in Roscommon.But everywhere the change was happening.As the day wore on, and the figures climbed, the staying hand of pious history was always there in the background. There have been disappointments before. Powerful interests who exert huge influence in Irish political and social life were not going to lightly give up the fight.In the headquarters of Together for\u0026nbspYes, they had run out of posters and people were offering to walk the city streets wearing sandwich boards. Minister for Health Simon Harris called in to see them for the first time.Artwork along one wall of their offices – quieter than ever they have been in the last three months – had a quote from WB Yeats: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”Education is the enemy of those who would work to keep Irish men and women slaves to a dark past.The volunteers were optimistic, and a little teary. But, sure, who wasn’t.They recounted trips to the airport to welcome those who were home to vote. One overseas camera crew was trying to find a No\u0026nbspvoter to balance their report. They couldn’t, until somebody noticed a plane from Medjugorje was due in.They waited for the passengers to come through and finally came up with three people who would be voting No.Yes, the signs were there. Driving into town, groups of volunteers gathered on roundabouts were being cheered and beeped by passing motorists. Joggers gave the thumbs-up. But on a flyover, a group of anti-abortion campaigners were getting nothing from the cars travelling below.The Taoiseach wore his little Yes\u0026nbspbadge on his lapel. He said in the Dáil during the week that if there is a vote for repeal “Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate.”And some who have been around since 1983 will be a little bit more emotional.\u0026nbspOur morning started with a trip to the Phoenix Park to see Michael D Higgins vote.\u0026nbspThe then senator Michael D was fiercely opposed to the “callous” referendum on the Eighth Amendment in 1983, when he was president of the Labour Party.\u0026nbspHe said the TDs promoting it were “monumental in their hypocrisy”, and then quoted Michael Davitt: “If the Irish had a weakness worse than drink, it was moral cowardice.” Not any more.\u0026nbspAfter he voted, he got into his car and prepared to leave. Then he saw me and got out again, striding over to say hello. We shook hands and there was a little embrace and kiss from Sabina.I told him it was all getting a little too much and I was so glad to see him.\u0026nbspThe President said he misses meeting a lot of people he used to see.\u0026nbspI mentioned that 1983 speech and all the things he said and wrote back then. He was, of course, right.\u0026nbspMichael D smiled and said softly “I’m above all that now.”But I swear, I know it, there were tears in his eyes.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here17:12\t\t\t        Kitty Holland broke the story of Savita\u0027s death in November 2012.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty ImagesCounting is under way in the referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, with a result due to be declared this afternoon.On Friday night, an exit poll carried out for The  by IpsosMRBI indicated a landslide victory for the Yes side, with 68 per cent, versus 32 per cent for No.Early tallies in constituencies across the Republic have indicated a strong lead for the Yes side and campaigners on both sides of the debate have been reacting to the forecasts on Saturday morning.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “I think what we’ve seen today really is the culmination of a quiet revolution that’s taken place in Ireland for the past 10 or twenty years. This has been a great exercise in democracy and the people have spoken.“The people have said we want a modern constitution for a modern country, that we trust women and we respect them to make the right decision, the right choices about their own healthcare.”Mr Varadkar told RTÉ the results so far show the nation is united, not ided. When asked what he believed the key factors were influencing people’s vote, the Taoiseach said: “Most of all and above all, it was the very many brave women and men who told their personal stories as to how the Eighth Amendment impacted on them, and impacted on them adversely.”Personal stories “allowed us as a nation to understand how this hard law created so many hard cases, and allowed us as a nation to come of age and to make this big change that we’re making in our constitution today.”Tánaiste Simon Coveney has expressed confidence that TDs previously opposed to repealing the Eighth Amendment will not seek to frustrate the passage of legislation.“I think what you will see now is the government moving quickly on the legislation and the opposition will support that too - I think there will be very few people in the Dáil who will try to frustrate what is now the clear will of the vast, vast majority of the Irish people,” he said.“For me, the margin of victory is important but equally important is that there is no Dublin versus the rest or no urbanrural ide -in virtually every part of the country, people have voted in big numbers to allow the government and the Oireachtas to change Ireland for the better.”Retired Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness, who is a veteran of the 1983 campaign opposing the addition of the Eight Amendment to the constitution. On Saturday she said they were very pleased at the time with the 33 per cent No vote. “Given the amount of bitterness at the time, we felt we would get 10 per cent. I remember being very pleased that we made 33 per cent of the vote.“It was a lonely place in 1983. I’ve just come into the count at the RDS where there are young people full of joy,” she said.Ms McGuinness was part of the Together for Yes campaign, participating in Grandparents for Yes and Lawyers for Yes. “Together for Yes worked very well together. They all held together, that’s important.”The campaign this time was “much more civilised” than in 1983 she said. However, she added that she felt the response of audience members who supported a No vote during the Claire Byrne show “might have made people vote the other way.”Minister for Health Simon Harris said this was an extraordinary day for Ireland and for women from across the country.“The Eighth Amendment abandoned women in crisis, the Minister said.“Women have been told take the plane, take the boat. Today we say take our hand. Women have been told you are on your own. Today we say we stand with you.”“People have given us a job to do. It is a big body of work to do. We have been given the go ahead,” he told the Marian Finucane show on RTÉ.Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Dr Rhona Mahony, said the referendum result “is all about the women who travelled in difficult circumstances and told their stories.” It is important that doctors can now care for women in crisis pregnancies in their own country,’ she told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show.“It’s a very emotional day. It’s all about real life and the dilemma faced by Irish women every day.”The difference between this referendum and that in 1983 is the level of information available to the public, she said.“This has been a very informed conversation from the get go.”She pointed out that from the Oireachtas Sub Committees, the Citizens’ Assembly, the Expert Group, people had been “really engaged.” Conversations had occurred, not just in public fora, but at family dinner tables, among students in universities, she said. “The country has listened. Women have spoken.”Dr Peter Boylan said this is a watershed moment for Irish women and a message to the 170,000 women who have had to travel outside this jurisdiction.The chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said this was a message to this women that they are valued.“This is about the women of Ireland and the couples of Ireland.”He said he was not surprised by the scale of the result.Director of the National Women’s Council and Co-Director of Together for Yes, Orla O’Connor thanked “every woman and man in every town, village and county who came out and voted yes. Because this is phenomenal.”“This was a grassroots, people campaign and I think what today will show is that this is a people’s referendum. Presuming that these exit polls are correct, the public haven’t just spoken, this is a resounding roar from Irish people about the horrors of the Eighth and how women should no longer be treated as second class citizens in our society.”“Today I think there will be an overwhelming feeling of relief, but also a very emotional one in terms of really being listened to and heard by the Irish public.”Colm O’Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland commended the “decades of campaigning and activism” that led to the referendum.“The scale of the indicated win in this is just phenomenal. We’re just incredibly proud and honoured to have been part of this campaign, what I’m struck most by is that this win is the result of decades of campaigning and activism by a very wide range of organisations and activists going on now for a very long time”, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “But today’s vote is mainly the result of the courage and integrity of women and families who have spoken out about the harm and suffering that they experienced because of the Eighth Amendment.Dublin South West Solidarity TD Paul Murphy said the projected result was a political “earthquake”.“It’s such a rejection, driven by young people and by women, of an Ireland of the past, of domination of the Catholic Church, of oppression of women,” he said.“People are looking for a very different type of society and it should send a clear message. It’s a rejection of dishonest lies, of the conservative right in Ireland which has had so much power for so long that their time is gone.”Ailbhe Smyth, co director of Together for Yes, speaking on Saturday morning said the indications are that Ireland is heading for “absolutely extraordinary” milestone in its history.“For those of us who have been campaigning for a long time and all of the younger people we have been campaigning with over the past several months, we are truly stunned and deeply relieved, deeply pleased and deeply grateful to the people of Ireland,” she told RTÉ.“Because this looks as if we have come to a real milestone. It is an incredibly significant change on a number of different levels, very immediately of course for women who need abortions - it is absolutely extraordinary.”Minster for Children Katherine Zappone said new laws legalising abortion will be passed “as quickly as possible” as much of the groundwork is already completed.“I think the legislation will go as absolutely as quickly as possible as any legislation could - I believe very much we can get this done before the end of the year,” she told RTÉ.Ms Zappone added: “I feel very emotional, I’m especially grateful to the women of Ireland who came forward to provide their personal testimony, about the hard times they endured, about the stress and the trauma they experienced because of the Eighth Amendment. “It is because of them that I feel a deep gratitude today as we hope and wait for the polls to turn into official results.”The Irish Family Planning Association has said it is committed to providing abortion care in Ireland .“Today is a transformative day for women’s health and reproductive rights,” IFPA chief executive Niall Behan said. “The people of Ireland have righted a historic wrong. The Yes vote ends decades of stigma, shame and silence around abortion and unintended pregnancy. It ends the rejection and abandonment of women by the state.”Tara Flynn, Irish actor, writer and Yes campaigner, said in a Twitter thread: “This is our home. Not some fictional 70s postcard hiding misery and shame. This proud, young, progressive, kind country is our home. There’s a lot to fix. But now we know we have the people power to fix it.”Minister for Education Richard Bruton has said the projected scale of the Yes vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment was “impressive,” and early tallies in his constituency appeared to confirm the exit polls.Mr Bruton said based on “the scale of the decision people have made, it’s fairly clear that they favour change.”People did not see the referendum campaign as one led by the Government, he said. “Parties weren’t taking a prominent position, so I think voters made up their own minds which I think is the strength of this decision,” he said.Caroline, who travelled to Liverpool with husband for a termination after FFA diagnosis: “This is a very emotional day for my family, I’m hoping that this will give us further closure for our grief, really hope that young women like myself won’t ever have to go through the same journey that we had.”“I’m glad to say that I’ve just given birth to my little girl since I last spoke to you. Things are really looking up for my family,” she told Morning Ireland.“I knew all my family and friends and any one that I spoke to about my story was going to vote yes, but I was very anxious. I regret that anxiety now, because I really should have trusted the people of Ireland.”“I’m so pleased that everybody in Ireland is very informed, they’re very educated and they really do have hearts of gold.”Independent Alliance members Shane Ross, Finian McGrath and John Halligan have welcomed the early tallies.The three members campaigned for a Yes vote. They said they now believe it is important to get the legislation through without delay.John McGuirk, spokesman for Save the 8th, told The  he had “made peace” with the result, acknowledging it is an overwhelming majority for Yes side.Katie Ascough, of pro-amendment LoveBoth, said the No side have been galvanised by the referendum for continued campaigning. “I think this is only the beginning of a really, really strong grassroots movement with the pro-life campaign and their supporting groups,” she said.Iona Institute spokesman David Quinn has acknowledged that many people who voted Yes were not pro-abortion, but were pro-choice. He told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane show: “Even the expectations of the Yes side were surpassed.”This was a complete reverse of the 1983 result, he said. “I don’t think any one expected it to this extent.”The anti-abortion side was “boiled down to its core” one third of the vote, he added. In 1983 it had been a lonely place to be on the pro-choice side, said Mr Quinn. “It took 35 years to reach this position.“No societal position remains forever. This is the position for the next few decades.”When asked about social media in the campaign, he said that Twitter was not the best way to judge anything. He defended the Iona Institute’s poster campaign saying that they used one simple image.“We didn’t run a ground campaign. We’re about getting profile in the media.”Declan Ganley, entrepreneur and anti-abortion campaigner, siad on Twitter: “When due to the snuffing out of their human rights, the first of countless thousands of Ireland’s unborn children are killed in Irish clinics or hospitals, all those that voted No can at least know you fought the good fight to try to save those little ones. Heros all.”Cora Sherlock, spokeswoman for the Love Both campaign: “This is a very sad day for Ireland, that people have voted for abortion.”“We need to remember what they have won,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“All that is being offered is abortion. There has been no talking about why Irish woman travel, what options could have been put on the table.”She said that the last time “a proper discussion” on alternative possibilities to abortion had taken place had been 20 years ago.Ms Sherlock paid tribute to Pro Life campaigners: “We will regroup, we will re-organise to ensure the safety of mothers and babies in Ireland.”Maeve O’Hanlon of the Love Both campaign said Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar had promised there would be restrictive abortion if people voted Yes in the referendum and he should now honour that commitment in whatever legislation is brought before the Dáil.“We have had very little discussion in this entire debate about the 97 per cent of abortion that take place for socio-economic reasons and very little discussions on why women have abortion and what we can do to bring those numbers down,” said Ms O’Hanlon.“We have heard nothing in recent months but about these rare tragic cases that we all have compassion for . . . for me whatever happens today it’s been a missed opportunity to address the underlying reasons why women have abortions.”Anne Rabbitte, Fianna Fail’s Children and Youth Affairs spokeswoman, who advocated retaining the Eighth Amendment, said “democracy has ruled” and the Oireachtas should now support the will of the people by legislating for abortion. “I think this tells us we are no longer a conservative society,” she said.“I think we might be traditional but we are not conservative, and I also think the fact that there was such a fantastic turnout yesterday gives an overwhelming, resounding support.”Independent TD Michael Healy Rae commented: “I voted no because of firmly held beliefs. The people voted the way they did, now it is over to the legislators. We will have to look at what the Minister will do in the Dáil. The people have spoken.”Independent TD and “no” campaigner Mattie McGrath has admitted he is “a bit surprised” by the projected outcome of the referendum and called for “compassion” for women in crisis pregnancies when it comes to drawing up the legislation.“The people have spoken and we have to listen to that,” the Tipperary TD said. “We have to see the legislation when it’s published and examine it.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The final tally at the Tipperary count centre shows a victory for the Yes side with 58.3 per cent of the votes, Conor Kane reports. All of the ballot boxes have been opened and all votes sorted, with the count expected to finish by 3.30pm after the returning officer went through “uncertain” votes with campaign representatives in the last hour.About 70 per cent of the votes have been tallied, with the incomplete tally due to the numbers of tally-people being down compared to a general election count.Turnout in Tipperary is projected at 64 per cent.The final tally in Wexford is 68 per cent Yes to 32 per cent No, according to Maria Pepper.In Louth, with all 179 boxes tallied, Yes is on 66.5 per cent and No is on 33.5 per cent, according to Elaine Keogh.Two thirds of people in Limerick city are in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment, according to final tally results, Kathryn Hayes reports.Tallies carried out by the Together for Yes campaign in Limerick showed 66.4 per cent of people voted Yes in the Limerick city constituency and 58.2 per cent in Limerick county voted in favour of repeal.This means just over 62 per cent of people in the Limerick region have supported the constituional change.The highest number of Yes votes were cast in boxes in polling stations in Corbally, Monaleen, Dooradoyle and Caherdavin.The highest number of Yes votes were cast in box four in Scout Hall in Shannon Banks, Corbally where 77.3 per cent of people voted in favour of repeal.In County Limerick eight per cent of boxes showed a higher percentage of No votes, mostly in areas closest to the north Kerry border.In Clouncagh in west county Limerick the vote was evenly split.An official result for Limerick is expected after lunch time today.The final tally for SligoLeitrim is 59 per cent Yes and 41 per cent No, according to Marese McDonagh. The final tally for SligoLeitrim is 59 per cent Yes and 41 per cent No, according to Marese McDonagh. With 100 per cent of the 110 ballot boxes in the Laois count centre in St. Mary’s Hall in Portlaoise now opened, new figures from tally people on all sides are indicating 58 per cent Yes and 42 per cent No. Stan Henderson reports that the final figure in the constituency is expected shortly after 4pm.In Kerry, the final tally is 59 per cent Yes to 41 per cent No.The adjudication of spoilt votes underway in Killarney, according to Anne Lucey.In Louth, the 100 per cent tally is still awaited but the Yes has it, according to Elaine Kehoe, who said that, with the odd exception, there was a clear majority for the Repeal campaigners.Early indications are a turnout out of at least 62-65 per cent and the Yes looks like securing 66 per cent of the vote against 34 for the No.In Kerry, Anne Lucey reports that the No side has been taken aback at the strength of the rural Yes vote. Three of Kerry’s five TDs and two prominent senators were strongly campaigning for No. However a box of votes in Bonane, on the Cork border near Kilgarvan and deep in so-called “Healy-Rae country”, showed 90 people voting Yes and 46 No, according to the tally this morning.With 33 of the 213 boxes in Kerry open, 57.3 per cent voted Yes and 42.7 per cent No. Both sides are running tallies, while a joint tally is being run by the Yes campaign with Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin working together on the tallies of the boxes.Meanwhile, the Tipperary constituency looks like voting Yes in the referendum by about 60 to 40 per cent, based on the ballot boxes opened and tallied so far this morning, Conor Kane reports.By 10.30am, about eight per cent of boxes had been tallied and the Yes votes totalled 2,141 while No votes were on 1,395 - a 60.5 per cent Yes vote.About 40 tally people are carrying out the estimate, mainly from Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and the LoveBoth organisation, with some supporters of prominent No campaigner and independent TD Mattie McGrath also involved.A result is expected in Tipperary by mid-afternoon but will not be announced until verified at the count headquarters in Dublin.Independent TD Thomas Pringle insists that Donegal will still return a yes vote in the abortion referendum, writes Stephen Maguire.The Killybegs-based Dáil deputy has been a steady yes campaigner from the outset of this campaign.And despite strong suggestions early on that Donegal could return a no vote, he is insistent that Donegal will vote in favour of repealing the Eighth Amendment.“I texted a friend two weeks ago and I said that it will be a 52 per cent Yes vote and I am sticking by that.“I know there are early suggestions that Donegal will vote No but I still feel that will change and that Donegal will eventually vote Yes,” he said.Deputy Pringle added that he is hopeful that Donegal, despite a tradition of voting no in referendums, will finally vote yes this time around.“I think that as a people and a county we have changed in the past couple of years and I welcome that,” he said.All of the 125 OffalyNorth Tipperary boxes have now been opened as counting continues in Banagher this morning, says Eoghan MacConnell. Tallies from 70 per cent of the boxes show Yes in the lead with 58 per cent (16,863 votes) of the votes while the No side is on 42 per cent (12,390 votes).With three-quarters of the boxes opened in Wexford, the tallies indicate that 67 per cent of people in the constituency have voted Yes and 33 per cent No, according to Maria Pepper.Barry Roche in Cork reports at 10.44am that early tallies from the two Cork City constituencies suggest the city and suburbs have voted very much in line with both The  and the RTÉ exit polls with bothh constituencies voting for Yes by approximately a ratio of 2 to 1.In Cork South Central, the constituency of both Tánaiste, Simon Coveney and Fianna Fail leader, Michéal Martin, who both were actively campaigning for a Yes vote, tallies suggested at least a two to one majority in favour f repeal.One box from Togher Girls National School, a largely working class community on the southside of Cork city, saw the Yes side win a comfortable victory with 174 vote to 84 No votes representing 67.4 per cent for the Yes side to 32.6 per cent for the No side.Also on Cork’s southside, one box from one of the Douglas polling stations, a more middle class area, saw the margin in favour of repeal, stretching to almost three to one with 211 people or 73.7 per cent voting for Yes and 75 or 26.3 per cent voting No.And in Carrigaline, home town of Tanaiste, Simon Coveney and prominent No advocate, Fianna Fail polling topping TD, Michael McGrath, the margin was even more emphatic with Yes taking 76.8pc or 136 votes and No taking 23.pc or 41 votes.In Cork North Central where both Fianna Fail TD Billy Kelleher, Sinn Fein’s Jonathan O’Brien and Solidarity TD, Mick Barry all came out and campaigned for a Yes vote, the margin was also emphatic to judge from a sample of tallies.In one box from Scoil Oileabhair in Ballyvolane, Yes won the day by 67.9pc to 32.1pc or 146 votes to 69 while the pattern was repeated in St Luke’s where one box returned 178 Yes votes and 78 No votes, a 69.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent victory for those seeking repeal.In Clogheen, a more rural community right on the edge of the city, the margin was equally emphatic for the Yes side with 117 voting Yes and 48 voting No, giving yet another clear margin of 70.9 per cent in favour of repeal to 29.1 per cent for those urging people to Save the Eighth.According to the latest tallies, 76 per cent of voters in Stoneyford in Kilkenny have voted Yes with 24 per cent of voters saying No, according to Mary Cody at 1037am. In Kilkenny City, tallies have been recording a 70 per cent Yes vote.Rural boxes in Kilkenny have been opened with the tallies recording a 60 per cent Yes vote.Boxes from Freshford, Clogh and Tullaroan all voted Yes according to the tallies. The tallies have recorded a 63 per cent Yes vote and 37 per cent No vote in Carlow.Donegal looks like one of the few counties in the country which could return a no vote, Stephen Maguire reports at 10.20am.With 14,652 votes tallied, the No vote stands at 52 per cent and the Yes vote at 48 per cent.Those boxes relate mainly to the Inishowen peninsula, including Letterkenny. The figures at present suggest that the peninsula will return a No vote in the abortion referendum.The result appears to be slightly closer in areas such as Buncrana and Moville.Boxes are still being opened with both the No and Yes campaigns suggesting a very close contest in Donegal.It is early days in the count centre at the Aura Leisure Centre in Letterkenny, but it appears that Donegal could be again about to return a no vote.At 10.11am in Offaly, Eoghan MacConnell reports that while the constituency may be the stronghold of No campaigners like Renua Leader Cllr John Leahy and rebel Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan, early tallies suggest the Yes side will win with ease in the mainly rural constituency. Counting for OffalyNorth Tipperary began this morning in Banagher College as the first 36 of the 125 boxes were opened at 9am. According to the very early tallies, the Yes side has a 59.17 per cent lead on the No side at 40.83 per cent. The tallies showed just two of 42 boxes counted so favoured the No side. That box was from Kinnitty near Birr with 169 No votes to 138 Yes and a second box in nearby Cloghan. Offaly North Tipperary FG TD Marcella Corcoran Kennedy said she was delighted by the early indications. Speaking at the count centre this morning, she said overturning the Eighth Amendment will be one of the most memorable points in her political career. Ms Corcoran Kennedy said she believed the large majority indicated in the poll should ensure legislation is passed quickly. “The fact that it looks like the result is so resounding means that those who chose to filibuster, chose to delay legislation, chose to behave irresponsibly and recklessly in the chamber, will be thumbing their nose at the will of the Irish people and I don’t think that that will be tolerated,” she remarked. Ms Nolan, who had canvassed for a No vote and lost the Sinn Féin party whip having voted against her party on the referendum, was not in the count centre this morning. Meanwhile, Renua Leader John Leahy admitted he was surprised by the strong Yes vote and would respect the vote of the electorate. With 30 to 40 per cent of the electorate opposed to repeal, Cllr Leahy said he believed there could be political instability in the wake of the vote. He said he felt sorry for the cohort of people who voted No, adding that Renua would now focus on ensuring there were supports for women in Ireland. “We have half of GPs saying they are not going to administer abortions,” he claimed. At 10.09am, Elaine Keogh reports from Louth that with 25 of the 179 boxes (14 per cent) tallied Yes is on 66.92 per cent and No on 33.08 per cent.Stan Henderson reports from Laois at 10.07am that early tallies indicate a 63 per cent Yes vote and a 37 per cent no vote so far. This is based on the opening of 30 ballot boxes out of 110 in total and a mixture of both rural and urban.In Galway East at 10.07am, Declan Rooney reports that early tallies in the constituency suggest a substantial Yes vote is likely with 60.58 per cent of votes counted.So far 31 of the 130 total boxes in the Galway East constituency have been opened and counted, which is almost 24 per cent of the total number of boxes, and there are clear suggestions that the national exit poll trends will continue in this rural Connacht constituency.While some of the larger Galway towns like Loughrea were included in that early tally, there were also a significant number of small villages included in the 31. To date only three boxes tallied have returned No votes.The tally counters are by and large representing the Yes campaign and they reported a huge swell in their numbers last night in Galway East after a Facebook appeal for them to join in the effort at the count centre in Headford Co Galway today. The tally figures provided for this constituency are from the Yes campaign.In Louth at 9.58am, Elaine Keogh reports that 13 of the 179 boxes tallied, the Yes are on 66.76 per cent and the No on 33.24 per cent. The returning officer does not expect a final result before 3pm.Meanwhile in LongfordWestmeath, the story might be slightly different.Liam Cosgrove reports at 9.58am that while last night’s exit polls may well have indicated a landslide victory for the Yes side, it would appear the outcome in LongfordWestmeath could be considerably tighter.That is from the initial indications taken from early tallies in the Longford end of the constituency with two boxes returning wins for the No side while another in north Longford had both sides deadlocked.There is a considerable presence here in Kenagh’s St Dominic’s Community Centre too, reflecting the huge level of engagement the referendum ignited among the wider electorate.In Cork East at 9.53am, Olivia Kelleher reports that 15 per cent of boxes had been opened and the vote in those was tallied at Yes 64 per cent and No 36 per cent.Overall indications from the postal vote which is comprised of gardai and army is 62 per cent Yes and 38 per cent No, while special votes from the elderly and infirm were coming in at 60 per cent Yes and 40 per cent No.In RoscommonEast Galway, Dan Dooner reports at 9.51am that there is cautious optimism among the Yes campaign after the opening of the first boxes at The Hyde Centre. One box from the town of Boyle showed 221 votes for repeal and 112 for No, according to Fine Gael Senator Frank Feighan, while MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan tallied a box from Roscommon town, which he said showed a vote of about 55 Yes and 45 No.“If that is reflected around the county, hopefully we’ll get a win,” he said.The MEP added that he had taken readings from around Roscommon and said he “had a general feeling that people were going to go for it”. He added that campaigners had received “at worst a 5050”on the doorsteps and praised those who had driven the Yes campaign in RoscommonEast Galway.

Photograph:   Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesThe handover period is over. The fiction of Ireland as a conservative, dogmatically Catholic country has been shattered. The past is left back there, and a new legacy is being created. A legacy of compassion, empathy, and maturity - a country taking responsibility for the care and health of women and girls. What happened in the referendum vote was seismic, but more seismic still was the realisation that this vote was reflecting change, not just instigating it. “They listened to us. They actually listened to us,” a young woman said to me, crying, in the RDS on Saturday morning.Together For Yes ran an excellent campaign, from start to finish. As the No campaign scraped the barrel, the Yes campaign always acted with dignity, with facts to the fore, and never once stooped. Together For Yes built an army around the country. An army of Us. In the RDS, people burst into tears when the Together For Yes bosses came into the room.For many, Ailbhe Smyth’s determination and calmness has been a source of great inspiration for decades. During the campaign she wore herself down so much that she struggled to walk in the final days. Meanwhile, female journalists from competing newspapers hugged each other when they spotted one another. Mary Lou McDonald was cheered by Labour party members, Simon Harris was cheered by people from Sinn Féin. This was a feminist movement non-partisan, grassroots, non-hierarchical where possible. We were all Together For Yes. There are thousands of stories from this referendum. It would be impossible for the media to catch them all, but the profound misunderstanding of this as a movement is notable for both media and politicians. There was, and remains, justified discontent amongst Yes campaigners, canvassers, and supporters, about how various sectors of the media patronised this long-standing, hugely significant movement, and viewed the issue though a conservative, party-political-focussed, and it has to be said, male, lens. In April, a senior campaigner told me, “I’m tired of being told how to suck eggs.” Political commentators did not seem to understand the vast array of activist experience iniduals brought to this campaign, nor the legacy of the marriage equality referendum which trained many canvassers and organisers for this battle. This is an existential issue for the Irish media, which needs to reflect on a disconnect that is pronounced. We were told this was a isive campaign. It was a unifying campaign. We were told this was a difficult issue for people, yet for many it was straightforward. We were told it was the third rail of Irish politics, so instead, the people led, from the activists and protestors to the canvassers and ordinary women and men who rolled up their sleeves, to the Citizen’s Assembly, to the women who shared their abortion stories. We were told about Middle Ireland. There is no Middle Ireland. Just Ireland. Its islands, villages, cities, towns, coasts, midlands, mountains, estates, flats, and fields. This campaign was intergenerational. Younger activists stood on the shoulders of those gone before them, and brought an energy, fearlessness, creativity and sense of unrelenting determination and optimism that inspired people across the board. The brilliantly eclectic make-up of the campaign brought in doctors, mothers, lawyers, students, trade unionists, the LGBT community, feminists, and everyone in between.Who did the No campaign really have in the end, apart from a cabal of fringe fundamentalists whom no one can really understand how or why they have gained such a platform and unfettered access to the media? The No campaign drove recklessly and ended in a car crash. They alienated undecided voters at every juncture with extreme messaging. In the final weeks, the No campaign acted as an asset to the Yes campaign, with spokesman John McGuirk, who revelled in bizarre statements, and campaigners such as Ronan Mullen getting short shrift, particularly when he disrespected a woman who shared her abortion story in a television debate. No amount of media training could connect No campaigners with the public. So what does this all mean? I bumped into the theatre-maker Grace Dyas in the RDS, “Today I feel accepted, loved, cherished.” This wasn’t just about abortion. It was about women feeling equal and valued, liberated and supported. “We did it,” everyone kept saying. “Landslide,” was the most repeated word. “Secrecy is not the same as private. Secrecy is toxic. Private is mature and grown up,” one campaigner said in the hotel across the road from the RDS. No more. No more secrecy, no more shame, no more stigma, only support, kindness, and care. Ireland has not just changed its constitution, or its society, it has changed the world with this vote. It has changed the world because in many countries - and American states - women’s reproductive rights are under attack. Ireland has stood up for women on a global stage. It’s hard to quantify how this feels. But once again, Ireland has shown its true colours. Our strength is not in our sameness, it’s in our ersity. Our strength is not our past, but our future. Our strength is not in inidualism, but togetherness. Our strength is not in dogma, but in empathy. To those women who have suffered under the eighth amendment, as a nation, we need to apologise to them. I’m sorry. We’re sorry. We’re better than that. What’s happening now is who we are.Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here17:12\t\t\t        Kitty Holland broke the story of Savita\u0027s death in November 2012.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table in London, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he urged Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party to reach a deal on restoring Stormont. “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade.

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Historic paddle steamer sinks off the coast of WalesMarkets braced as Italy stand-off deepens over populists\u0026#39 demand for Eurosceptic finance ministerRichard Branson steps up his astronaut training as first space flight is \u0026#39just months away\u0026#39Comment: Train companies have a simple new trick for abolishing delaysTransgender people encouraged to become priests in Church of England ersity driveWhat does the \u0026#39Yes\u0026#39 vote mean for Ireland?Clergy buy cassocks recycled from bottles as Church of England joins war on plastic Comment: Democrats are too busy fighting the last election to make progress in the nextNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe \u0026#39to face second trial\u0026#39 in Iran on new chargesVictoria Falls back on tourist trail after Mugabe ousted from powerImran Khan interview: Only anti-corruption drive can pull Pakistan back from brink of chaosIreland votes Yes to repeal tough abortion laws in referendum – what happens next?Giant panda cub makes first appearanceHow Royal Wedding preacher Michael Curry\u0026#39s late grandmother inspired that epic sermonSouth Korean president meets Kim Jong-un in surprise summitYes campaign celebrating early results of Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendumComment: I used to be pro-abortion on demand.

This is what I want you to knowThis risk, and the cost to the NHS, increases with every point of BMI and could result in a major economic toll as well as the health cost if governments fail to get to grips with it, the researchers from the UK and Ireland said.While Scotland currently has fractionally higher rates of morbid obesity, 4 per cent in 2015 compared with 3 per cent in England and Wales, this is due to reverse.Under current trends it is predicted that 11 per cent of the population in Wales will be morbidly obese in 2035, roughly 340,000 adults, while Scotland is likely to plateau at about 5 per cent and England will rise to about 8 per cent.“Wales have a greater portion of the population deprived per capita than England, this may be a potential reason,” Laura Webber, an honorary assistant professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a director of public health modelling at the UK Health Forum, told The Independent.“In terms of morbid obesity specifically, Wales only have one obesity clinic, which could also impact.”Morbidly obese people should be given free flu jabs, says healthKhan to ban junk food advertising on London transportIn England, where close to 4.4 million adults will be affected, 16 per cent of men between the age of 55 and 64 are predicted to be morbidly obese – the highest prevalence of any group.“The morbidly obese group are particularly vulnerable to diseases, which is of course very costly to the NHS,” Ms Webber added.Morbid obesity is already a huge burden on the economy and health services, accounting for around a third of all obesity-related costs.While overweight and obesity trends for Great Britain have been projected to 2035, until now there have been no trend estimates for morbid obesity.BMI is a widely accepted measure of obesity, calculated as a person’s weight ided by their height squared, to be morbidly obese it must exceed 40kgm2. Other metrics look at whether a person is suffering obesity related diseases before age 35.The latest findings on morbid obesity are being presented at the European Obesity Congress in Vienna on Saturday.Webber and her co-author, Laura Keaver from the Sligo Institute of Technology in the Republic of Ireland, said measures to reverse these trends and the underlying social causes “must be an important public health priority”.Health news in picturesHealth news in picturesResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping activeA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.\u0026#13Research from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.The family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. Thousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.Most breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.A record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.The number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.Human eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take partTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.A major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselvesNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.\u0026#13Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Growth in obesity is predicted from annual health reports from each country – there was insufficient data for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – coupled with employment and education data – socioeconomic factors that have been shown to be important predictors of BMI.In Scotland, the significantly slower rate of growth can be attributed to work carried out by the Scottish government in addressing inequality, the researchers said.“The government put a massive push on developing a route map for how we can actually combat this,” said Ms Keaver.“They put together resources from the NHS that were proving to be effective. They did put a lot of work into it.”Meanwhile in England a tax on sugary drinks has helped many producers reformulate their products, but a voluntary levy on sugary foods has not resulted in manufacturers making significant reductions.For Wales, where the inequality between people in managerial-level jobs and routine or manual professions is expected to become more significant, the pair say health interventions should be targeted at these groups.A spokesperson for Public Health Wales told The Independent: “Health trends and future predictions are complex, and predictions should not be taken as facts – they provide us with a picture of where past trends may take us if nothing changes, and give us great motivation to try and change those trends for a better future.While tackling obesity, especially in early years, is a priority and a new obesity strategy is under development – to be published in the autumn – they added “we have a significant challenge to overcome”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.As its structure is so different, the i-motif can be used as a switch when paired with regular DNA – with the two different shapes being recognised as either “on” or “off”.This has already been applied in basic nanomachine applications, and work by Dr Waller and her colleagues has expanded the repertoire of switches that can be used in such settings.By adding copper salts to DNA in oxygen-free conditions, they found DNA could be changed into an i-motif shape. This could then be further modified into another shape called a “hairpin” by adding oxygen to the mix.These results were published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.“One of the direct applications is in DNA-based computing,” explained Dr Waller.Decoding rose DNA could allow scientists to create better flowersThe concept of DNA computing has floated around for years, with Microsoft investigating potential applications and using DNA for data storage.Some scientists have used the code of DNA to store information, or constructed simple logic gates and circuits.“You can use DNA to make logic gates and one of the advantages in using DNA is computing is that you can carry out calculations in parallel if your different types of logic gates are represented by different triggers or ingredients,” said Dr Waller.“So the fact we have discovered separate triggers for the same type of DNA means you could increase the output you could actually use.”Other technological applications of DNA include the creation of tiny “nanobots” that can deliver drugs to parts of the body.“DNA is biocompatible, so if you make a nanomachine out of DNA you can introduce it to a cell and it doesn’t get destroyed or recognised as quickly as some other agents we introduce,” said Dr Waller.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Civil liberties campaigners called on Sainsbury’s to ditch the surveillance screens, which were branded a “gross intrusion” of privacy and a “blatant attempt to intimidate customers”. One Sainsbury’s regular, who did not want to be named, told The Independent she had been a customer for decades but was “shocked” to find herself being filmed while purchasing her groceries at a branch in central London. “Not only does it feel like there is mistrust and that you are potentially guilty of something, but there’s also the fear they will be storing your data.” She added: “I shan’t be using their self-service machines ever again. I felt violated.”Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12bn merger with AsdaAnother shopper, Alex Durham, said he encountered the screens at an outlet in Fitzrovia, London. The 27-year-old filmmaker said: “It struck me as bizarre really. I don’t want to seem all tinfoil hat, but it just seemed a little bit Orwellian. “It’s a bit bizarre just to be looking at your face while you’re doing something, because it really feels like someone is over your shoulder while you’re just getting a packet of crisps and a coke.“It just felt a little bit strange.”After asking Sainsbury’s about the cameras, he was told they were to help “facilitate a better customer journey”. Other customers complained on social media to the supermarket. One said a screen “clearly” showed the pin machine, while another posted an image showing a Sainsbury’s monitor displaying a keypad. I took a photo this morning and you can clearly see the pin machine and keypad. I’ll be boycotting this store and any other store that has these screens. It’s insane. pic.twitterQqE2PINOsO“What’s up with recording customers entering their PINs at the self-checkout?” Gabriel Currie asked. One Twitter user said the CCTV meant you could see down my top and this image was displayed on the screen.Complaining to Sainsbury’s, Chloe Heatlie said: “It’s pretty creepy to be frank with you. Certainly didn’t benefit my customer experience.”Multiple social media users vowed to boycott the machines, and even Sainsbury’s itself, until the screens were removed.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said the cameras were part of a “security measure” to increase safety at its stores. UK news in picturesUK news in picturesRory Mcilroy has taken the clubhouse lead in round two of the BMW PGA championship at Wentworth.Alastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

The screens act as a deterrent to customers by making them more aware they are being watched.Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, said: “Sainsbury’s new self-surveillance screens are a gross intrusion of shoppers’ privacy, broadcasting the contents of our wallets and baskets. “These new cameras are a blatant attempt to intimidate customers and make us feel more closely watched than ever.“It is absolutely disgusting for Sainsbury’s to treat its loyal customers like criminals, especially as it is now nigh on impossible to get a human checkout. Big Brother Watch calls on Sainsbury’s to remove these surveillance screens urgently.”Sainsbury’s said it had installed the cameras at more than 300 stores, but refused to say if they would be rolled out to its remaining 1,100 outlets or whether the monitors were proving an effective deterrent.The supermarket said footage from its self-facing cameras, some of which were installed last year, were kept for 31 days before being overridden. According to a recent study, £3.2bn worth of goods is stolen from UK self-service tills every year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brussels’ decision to kick the UK out of the scheme was angrily denounced by ministers, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, vowing to launch a separate satellite initiative if the EU refuses to back down.Tensions were already running high following days of strained negotiations in Brussels, during which one senior EU source described the UK’s demands as “fantasy”. Mr Hammond dismissed that remark as “not helpful”.Speaking at a legal conference in Lisbon, Mr Barnier noted the importance of agreeing how the relationship between the UK and the EU will be governed once Britain leaves the bloc.He said: “We have probably made a lot of progress on the substance of the withdrawal agreement, but without effective governance, these gains will be of limited value.“Because without agreement on governance, and without an agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.“The United Kingdom is well aware that our citizens and businesses, on both sides of the Channel, need legal certainty.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Hinting at continued frustration in Brussels over a perceived lack of detail in the UK’s negotiating demands, Mr Barnier urged ministers to be more “realistic” and warned them against playing a ‘blame game” with the EU.He said: “We also want an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom in the long term. But to achieve this, we need realistic proposals from the UK – proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.”He added: “For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It’s its decision. Not ours. And that has consequences.“The United Kingdom must look at the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.”Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe EU and the UK are at loggerheads over how disputes will be settled after Brexit. Britain wants to establish a joint committee, with members appointed by political leaders, to resolve any issues that arise, but European leaders have insisted the ECJ must be given the final say.Ms May has previously insisted: “The jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end.”In a sign of the continued distance between the two negotiating teams, Mr Barnier said: “We cannot accept that a jurisdiction other that the Court of Justice of the European Union determines the law and imposes its interpretation on the institutions of the Union.”The former French minister said the EU was open to the UK changing its stance, but that time was running out.He said: “If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it must tell us. The sooner the better.“We are asking for clarity. A negotiation cannot be a game of hide and seek.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It is uplifting​that Britain unites after such atrocities.But let’s not treat the dead as if they were claimed by some natural disaster we are powerless to prevent. Let’s not just put our trust in “hope”.They were massacred by an Islamist extremist radicalised by the UK’s largest jihadist network. Up to 25,000 live among us, with 3,000 a direct threat and 500 under constant surveillance.Yes, we should mourn. But let us also resolve to give our security services every penny they need to keep us safe.Let us lock away terror plotters for decades. Let us stop known terrorists who are still abroad returning home.Let us force social media giants to silence those who incite terror.Let us maintain effective anti-radicalisation programmes such as Prevent, even as the Left undermines them.And let us stop pretending our greatest threat is Islamophobia, instead of a warped interpretation of Islam that justifies slaughtering innocents at pop concerts.MARK Carney demeans his role as Bank of England chief by churning out fantasy ­figures to bash Brexit.His claim that it has cost every family £900 a year is based on the Bank’s own back-of-a-fag-packet estimate in 2016 of how well we’d do if we voted Remain.Given how hopeless its other Project Fear predictions proved, the margin for error must be 100 per cent.Besides, it is not Brexit itself holding back growth. It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like. If Theresa May formed a position fully honouring the result, and told the EU to like it or lump it, the unease would end overnight.Our economy would take off like a rocket.IT is disgraceful that Google is revealing rape victims’ names via the “autocomplete” function on its searches. The tech giant must be held accountable.But its software only produces those identities because troublemakers or morons have posted them illegally on Facebook, Twitter or other forums.They must be traced and fined heavily.

The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy. I’m not sure why we let Roman in in the first place.You don’t get his kind of money by being lovely to everybody, do you?First we helped wreck the Russian economy in the early 1990s by plundering its state run industries. Then we opened the doors to a whole bunch of Russkie gangsters – sorry, oligarchs – with boats the size of Poland. Anyway, I’ll probably end up glowing like a Belisha beacon just for writing this.BROADCASTER Dan Snow has admitted he lies to his daughters.He’s told them that during the war there were loads of female Spitfire pilots. Zooming around, shooting down krauts. He says he doesn’t want them to feel limited by their gender. He should have gone further. Told them that back then Britain was led by a nice lady called Winnie.And that the first person up Everest was a little girl called Hillary. And as for that Ada Hitler . . .THE Iraqis are executing the IS jihadi brides. Loads of them.Some of them are whining that they had no idea their husbands were evil Islamists. One of them said she thought she was marrying a rapper.Yeah, right love. We’ve got a few here, mind.Women who went out to join IS and then thought better of it. They’re lucky we won’t extradite them to Iraq.HEY – got your Royal Wedding gift bag yet? Guests to the wedding are flogging them on eBay for as little as £20,000. Hell of a bargain. I’ve got a bid in on one right now. It says it contains:I’VE got a bit of a soft spot for Victoria Beckham. She’s been criticised for not smiling at the wedding of Harry and Meghan.Some people have suggested Posh Spice was looking a bit grim because David had been out on the pull again. Nah. She wasn’t smiling because, basically, she’s a miserable cow.And I like that. Why should she have to wander around grinning like a village idiot?Keep the sulk and the pout, Vikki, love. Plus I liked what she was wearing at the bash. She was dressed as if for the funeral of someone she didn’t know very well. She looked great.SO, all four of the great American authors are dead. Both Tom Wolfe and Philip Roth died this week.Saul Bellow and the finest of them all, John Updike are already dead.These gentlemen were my heroes when I was growing up. But how long will they be remembered?Updike is already unfashionable on account of his alleged sexism. Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you. Read The Bonfire of the Vanities, or Couples, or The Dean’s December and marvel at the insight and the beauty of the prose . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat? How about more when, inevitably, that isn’t enough?The sums needed are astronomical.The Government is set to put in £350million extra a week.But that merely keeps it going as demand soars.Any improvement will need far more — and the NHS is already asking for it.Experts say the annual budget must soar by £56BILLION within 15 years, or 9p on income tax.No sensible Government will raise that, nor should it.On its 70th birthday, Theresa May should announce a Royal Commission, and let the brightest health experts and politicians agree on a new NHS model we can afford.WE back day-release prisoners getting jobs . . . under strict conditions.Here’s why. Our jails are violent, drug-infested cesspits breeding hopelessness.Lags emerge with no prospects into unemployment, then drift back into crime in a dismal cycle costing billions.What a difference, though, when a store chain like Timpson takes a chance on ex-cons and gives them a new start.But Justice Secretary David Gauke MUST ensure watertight vetting.If just one sex predator or thug reoffends on day release, the idea will fall apart.HOW come vast numbers of migrants still flock to a Britain which supposedly became racist overnight on June 23, 2016?Did the 200,000 net new arrivals last year not get the Remoaners’ memo?Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was too excited and too much in disbelief to be able to settle.“I did try to catch some z’s but after a couple of hours of tossing and turning I just ran downstairs to get the laptop and check if the win was real and still there.”In a recent study conducted by Casumo, Brits revealed the cash sum they would need to win in order to feel like winners, valuing that winning feeling at £336K.The average Brit reckons they achieve an average of three ‘little wins’ a week, but only one in 10 says they feel like a true winner at life.In light of his recent windfall, Dennis has already started crossing things off his bucket list.For starters, he gave generous cash gifts to each of his two children and intends to go car shopping.With a holiday booked in Tenerife with his wife next week, Dennis is currently thinking of other ways to enjoy their retirement together, including finishing off their home renovation.Last December, Dennis created an account on the site for the first time and has become a regular player.Claire Steggles from online casino Casumo, said: “We are always happy to see our customers win big, and we hope Dennis uses the money to achieve his dreams.“While a score of £65K is a little far off the winning sum we uncovered in our study, for a £2 entry it’s not bad innings.”Casumo has over 1000 casino games to choose from, including slots, table games, live casino and jackpots."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408805610.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit tourists accuse kfc berlin of racism","story":"The group said they were told to leave for being too loud - but they claim they were doing nothing wrong and were targeted because of their skin colour.Staff at the KFC branch said the tourists had been throwing food and insulting staff members, leaving the manager no choice but to “protect staff and guests”.Kellon Pierre, 38, who was part of the group, said they weren’t throwing food and that the allegation was a “huge lie”.He also accused the police who arrived at the scene of “gross overreaction”.Five police cars arrived at the restaurant in Berlin during the incident on Monday afternoon.German police flatly denied any accusations of racism.In the video, officers who arrived at the scene can be seen trying to reason with the group and eventually escorting them out of the restaurant.They can be heard telling the group in English to “go out right now”.Throughout the video the officers tell the woman filming to put down the camera but she refuses, saying she has a right to film for her own safety.German police said they were planning to press charges for being filmed without their consent.As she leaves, the woman filming tells diners in the restaurant that they are being kicked out “because we’re black”.Pierre told Die Welt: “We were the only black people in the restaurant and we were the only ones asked to be quieter, even though other people laughed too.”Outside the restaurant, an officer says: “You wait here.

He was widely praised for bringing Marlon Brandos Method style of acting to the screen.But many remember him for his 1952 testimony before the House Committee on un-American Activities.There, he outed suspected Hollywood communists at a time many were losing work due to an industry blacklist. The anger had not subsided when Kazan was given an honorary Oscar in 1999. Some boycotted the ceremony and when Kazan approached the podium, after being introduced by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Performers including Ed Harris and Nick Nolte sat grimly and refused to applaud. In his brief speech, Kazan offered no apologies. Carrying two books and a notepad, disgraced Weinstein walked slowly from a black SUV past crowds of reporters and TV crews.He gave a wry smile as he ran the media gauntlet towards the front door of the station.Weinstein — still being investigated for alleged sex crimes in London and LA — was questioned for around two hours before leaving the precinct in handcuffs flanked by two officers.In his first public appearance since October, he was then brought to a Manhattan court for a preliminary hearing.The former Miramax boss agreed to hand over $1million bail to ensure his release ahead of his trial, due to begin on 30 May.Weinstein will also wear a security tag, hand over his passport and submit to travel restrictions as part of his bail conditions.His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said outside court that Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.Mr Brafman added: We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges.We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence.Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex allegations, after around 100 women came forward to allege sexual misconduct and harassment by him.The avalanche of claims spawned the #MeToo movements, which saw sexual allegations levied against a host of Hollywood stars including Kevin Spacey, Ben Affleck and Brit star Ed Westwick.Lucia Evans - then aspiring star Lucia Stoller - told last year how she had been approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004.The university student, now 34, said she gave him her number and an assistant set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office, in the city a short time later.She says he then pounced on her when they were alone in an office together – forcing her to perform a sex act on him.Evans said: “I said, over and over: ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t’. It was like it was just another day for him. It was no emotion.”She revealed she struggled with the decision to make a formal police complaint about Weinstein in an interview with the New Yorker yesterday.She told Ronan Farrow, one of the first journalists to report on the Weinstein allegations: At a certain point, you have to think about the greater good of humanity, of womankind.Last night leading #MeToo figures reacted to news of Weinsteins imminent arrest.Rose McGowan, who accuses him of raping her in 1997, said: I, and so many of Harvey Weinsteins survivors, had given up hope that our rapist would be held accountable by law.Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice.Investigators are also examining whether Weinstein broke an antiquated law that forbids luring or inducing any women to travel across state lines for the purpose of committing a sex crime, according to the Wall Street Journal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408834890.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fat workers start later work home rush hour anxiety","story":"Bosses should offer them flexible starts if they struggle on public transport or let them work from home.Professor Stephen Bevan told the European Congress on Obesity that firms should make more accommodations for overweight workers.Mr Bevan, of the Institute for Employment Studies, called for new laws so fat staff could sue if they felt they missed out on a job or promotion on weight grounds.Christopher Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, branded the plan ludicrous.

They were also given behavioural support for six months.The rest received standard NHS weight loss advice.A year after being put on the programme, those put on meal replacements had lost 24 lbs, while those just given standard weight loss advice lost just 7 lbs.The findings were backed by former government obesity tsar Susan Jebb.She said: “It’s acceptable, effective and safe.“It’s only with all this info that we can really consider suggesting that it could be offered as a routine treatment for obesity.” She said it works because it is simple to follow and dramatically slashes calorie intake.Diet expert Prof Jebb, from Oxford University, said: “It is a break from old habits and a chance to re-establish new ones.“Losing a lot of weight is very motivating. Dieting is hard and boring and a short sharp programme may be easier to stick to that a long slow.” The Cambridge Weight Plan was developed by Dr Alan Howard at Cambridge University in the 1970s and launched as a commercial product in the UK in 1984.Fans include former Eastenders and Loose Women star Martine McCutcheon, who lost a stone in five weeks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, its occupant is a Russian oligarch, a man worth upwards of $11 billion.Mr Abramovich bought the chateau in 2001, two years before he secured a major foothold in the UK, buying Chelsea Football club.As the first Russian oligarch in London, he turned the club around and built up an empire in the British capital.It now includes his Kensington mansion and a Russian Steel firm, Evraz, which is headquartered in London and, this year, has been the best performing FTSE 100 company, gaining 42%.A public footpath runs along one of the chateau\u0027s perimeter walls. As we walk along, the cameras move and follow us. For someone who values his privacy, it\u0027s a wonderful spot.Moored off shore is his boat, the Eclipse: registered in Bermuda, with a crew of 70, a helipad, a mini submarine.It is staggeringly large.Beyond it is another yacht, a little smaller, but still huge. This was Mr Abramovich\u0027s too, until he lost a bet and handed it over to a mate.We approach the Eclipse and politely call out to the staff on board.As an attempt to find and speak to a Russian billionaire about his visa issues, this was always likely to be futile. And so it was.Our first introductions were met with a clear \"no\".But on the radio from our boat to the bridge of the Eclipse we managed a brief convention.Could we find out, I ask somewhat foolishly, whether Mr Abramovich is aboard and able to speak to us.\"That\u0027s all well received, Sir. At this moment in time we are unable to comment on the location of any guests. That\u0027s unable to comment. Thank you.\" Obviously he wasn\u0027t going to speak to us, but a little bit of his empire up close is a useful hint of the life of an oligarch.So what\u0027s the British government\u0027s apparent issue? Russian man gets rich, enjoys life, invests in London plenty have.Why, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said this week, will the UK \"continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin?\"On the specifics of Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issue, the UK government has not commented.Sources close to him, quoted in the Russian media, say there isn\u0027t a problem, just a delay.Mr Gould-Davies was serving in the British Embassy in Moscow when KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London.He has watched Russian behaviour in Crimea, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and, most recently, the Salisbury attack.\"Russian and other wealth in the UK has long been an ethical concern, but we have a dramatic new concern in particular since the events in Salisbury,\" he said.\"Russia is presenting a more aggressive threat to the United Kingdom and other Western European countries than it has at any time since the Cold War period.\"Now the Russian state, the Putin regime, depends upon elite networks of power and influence and wealth.\"So the Russian State is on the one hand presenting a threat on the other hand it\u0027s been sustained and supported by elites who make use of the UK\u0027s financial services to keep their wealth safe.\"That cannot be right.\"On the same day that Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issues emerged, the British government\u0027s foreign affairs select committee published \"Moscow\u0027s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK\", a report which recommended that the government cracked down on Russian wealth in the UK.It is something that American banker and author Bill Browder has been calling for ever since he accused the Kremlin of murdering his lawyer. Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009.He had represented Mr Browder, who had been accused of tax fraud by the Kremlin.He lobbied the US congress to introduce the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights abuses with sanctions.He has called for the same in Europe and the UK.\"The US has made a very complete list. They made a list of 200 oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. I think you could operate off of that list and the US sanctioned seven of those individuals. I think the UK as a first step should sanction the same individuals that the US has sanctioned,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich is not among those sanctioned in the US and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\"But Mr Browder says all oligarchs close to the Russian president should be targeted.\"Most oligarchs did the deal with Putin and effectively became his business partner.\"And so when you hear about an oligarch worth $13 or $14 billion, probably $7 [billion] of that is Vladimir Putin\u0027s. \"And so, if you want to go after Vladimir Putin, you go after the oligarchs,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich\u0027s proximity to Putin goes back years.Well before he acquired Chelsea, he was one of Russia\u0027s most influential businessmen.He was close to Mr Putin\u0027s predecessor Boris Yeltsin he helped Mr Putin rise and he benefited from it.Mr Browder welcomed the decision this week to pass into law the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which includes the \"Magnitsky amendment\" allowing the British government to freeze the assets and ban the visas of human rights violators from Russia and elsewhere.\"That\u0027s an absolutely powerful tool that can be used and should be used aggressively against these Russian oligarchs,\" he says."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-guy-hands-terra-firma_4320908.jpg?20180526142538 ","title":"tycoon hands plots 25bn takeover of quintain","story":"Annington is owned by a separate Terra Firma-run vehicle which has a number of external investors\u0026#8206 including an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund.Last year, Terra Firma secured a \u0026#1634bn refinancing of Annington, raising \u0026#163550m of new equity and \u0026#1633.4bn of debt, in a move that paved the way for a push into the private rented sector.Some analysts believe the company is now worth over \u0026#1635.5bn and that an exit via a stock market listing could be easier for Mr Hands if Annington and Quintain were to merge.It is unclear whether Terra Firma is separately exploring options for the future of Annington although people close to it believe that that is inevitable in the coming months even if Quintain does not form part of its future."},{"url":null,"title":"best cycling routes uk families","story":"AdvertorialUK’s best bank holiday bike routes for families revealed – plus the things all cyclists need to packWhy not pack up the bikes - and a sandwich or two - and head out on a group adventure?\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:21, 25 MAY 2018Updated12:56, 26 MAY 2018AdvertorialThere are so many rides to choose from\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLife doesn’t get much better than spending the bank holiday weekend cycling around some of the UK’s most beautiful spots with your loved ones. \u2028Considering where to go and in need of inspiration? We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

The plot has reportedly been dubbed the ‘Gove-Davidson succession’.  It would see the Environment Secretary and leading Brexiteer become PM for a couple of years, finishing off Brexit negotiations.  But Mr Gove would just be in no.10 for a transitional period until Scottish Conservatives chief Ms Davidson takes over, according to \u0027the plan\u0027. Ms Davidson is often tipped as a future leader. A former Cabinet minister reportedly called her “the messiah” and the answer to Tory issues.  They told The Sun : “Michael wants to be the leader, but he also accepts he can’t fight a general election.  “He knows he’s toxic to too many voters after his education reforms and running the Leave campaign. “Ruth can and should fight the 2022 general election for us, as she’s got it all - but we need to fill the gap – and Michael can do that.”  Earlier this week, Ms Davidson appealed for more young people to join the party. Launching a new think tank, Onward, she said: Sometimes as Tories we just look a bit dour. A bit joyless, a bit authoritarian sometimes. We don\u0027t get to win if we start hectoring the people we need to vote for us. We don\u0027t get to say \u0027please stand on the right\u0027 like every Tube message out there.

The MV Oliver Cromwell , a steamer and riverboat hotel, sank around 12 miles off the coast during a journey to Ireland, sparking panicked calls to emergency crews.   The local Holyhead Coastguard were called at around 2pm to reports of the incident, but they could not do anything to prevent the boat sinking around three hours later, the Daily Post reports .  The boat, which was built in 1922 and converted into a riverboat hotel in 1993, was heading to Coleraine on Wednesday after being sold to a new owner.  Nobody was injured and the coastguard said the sinking did not cause any pollution. The RNLI were also called out to assist with the operation. An RNLI spokesman said: “The call from UK Coastguard at 2.20pm cited a paddle steamer on tow towards Ireland taking on water approximately 10 miles west of South Stack. “Holyhead ’s Severn class all-weather lifeboat Christopher Pearce launched immediately and headed to the scene, arriving there within 40 minutes.  “On arriving at the scene, it was evident the 36-metre vessel was in trouble and beginning to sink from the bow. “She was being towed by tug towards Ireland after a period in the south of England.” The crew found that the paddle steamer did not have anyone on board, and did not contain any fuel. The spokesman added: “A very quick decision was made by the coxswain that the situation was too dangerous to try and put any crew on board the stricken vessel. “Within half an hour, the vessel had sunk further into the sea, and at 4.20pm she sank completely into the 50-metre deep waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i cant see how affects","story":"News\u0027I can\u0027t see how it affects his education\u0027: Mum\u0027s anger over schoolboy, 14, sent home over \u0027army-style\u0027 haircutCharlotte Healy said her son Casey Healy was upset when St Thomas More Language College staff sent him home\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKaty Clifton21:02, 25 MAY 2018NewsSt Thomas More Language College has stood by its strict behaviour guidelines (Image: Google Street View)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum of a 14-year-old schoolboy sent home over his \u0027army-style\u0027 haircut is now threatening to withdraw her son from school.

The company said: We have identified an intermittent fault in how some caps have been applied across our 750ml glass bottles. The quality of the drink itself is not affected, however the issue may cause a small number of caps to pop off unexpectedly. As a precautionary measure we are asking consumers who have any of the products detailed to open the bottles with care to release the pressure.

Shoppers have reportedly been avoiding the avocado\u0027s relatively high price tag by passing them off as carrots at self-service tills. Carrots are one of the cheapest vegetables by weight, which has led to suspicions that supermarket customers are abusing electronic checkouts in a shoplifting scam. Emmeline Taylor, a senior lecturer in criminology at City, University of London, said people switch labels or deliberately input the wrong item to pay less for produce.  She told The Times newspaper that she first spotted the trend in Australia and it is also happening in Britain. I was working with retailers to reduce shoplifting when one major supermarket discovered it had sold more carrots than it had ever had in stock, she said. Puzzled by this development it looked into its inventories and found that in some cases customers were apparently purchasing 18kg of carrots in one go. Unfortunately this wasn\u0027t a sudden switch to healthy eating, it was an early sign of a new type of shoplifter.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s ability to sell out everything from a \u0026pound175 Reiss dresses to those trademark pairs of nude LK Bennett pumps has caused a frenzy in the UK fashion industry. But now she has a rival in the new Duchess of Sussex, as experts predict Meghan Markle’s selling power could outshine even Kate’s appeal. And it’s not just Meghan’s fashion which could give the UK economy a boost – the American former actress has the added bonus of pulling in sales from her homeland across the Atlantic. So could the Markle Sparkle could take over the Kate effect...? KATE  FASHION It’s estimated that Kate pumps \u0026pound150million in revenue to the UK fashion industry every year, and her ability to sell out clothes is renowned. When her Sarah Burton wedding dress went on display at Buckingham Palace in the summer of 2011, approximately \u0026pound8m was raised for the Royal Collection.  Meanwhile, a \u0026pound38 Topshop dress she wore while pregnant with Prince George sold out within an hour of her wearing it to film studios.  And it’s not just luxury fashion and high street brands Kate helps promote. A \u0026pound10 bracelet in aid of Suffolk’s Treehouse Hospice sold out after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one in 2012. BEAUTY Ever since it was reported that Trilogy Rosehip Oil is responsible for Kate’s glowing complexion, a bottle of the \u0026pound16.50 product started selling every 20 seconds.  But her bouncy, blow-dried brunette locks are the real source of her beauty branding power. When it was revealed that the Duchess is a fan of Richard Ward Cleanse and Condition Shampoo, the \u0026pound5.99 product sold out immediately in Waitrose.  Richard Ward is Kate’s hairdresser and \u0026pound325 appointments at his Knightsbridge salon have seen waiting lists extend to six months since she became royalty. LIFESTYLE Kate and Prince William’s beloved dog Lupo is a treasured addition to their family, and is regularly seen in official portraits. The Kennel Club attributed the raised profile and interest in English Cocker Spaniels to Lupo, following a 50% surge in searches for the breed on their website following their ownership of the dog.  Meanwhile, the royal couple love taking the kids to the French Alps and after they were pictured visiting luxury skiing resort Courchevel, bookings for the three nearest airports spiked with 57% more flights booked than over the same dates the previous year. KIDS Valuation firm Brand Finance estimates that Princess Charlotte adds \u0026pound101m to the UK economy each year, while her older brother Prince George adds \u0026pound76m. At just six months old, Charlotte proved she had the same selling power as her mother. The \u0026pound21 floral dress she wore a family portrait immediately sold out and its Spanish designer M\u0026ampH was inundated with orders from around the world.  Meanwhile, Prince George’s cuddly kangaroo backpack sold-out just hours after Prince William was spotted holding it during a trip to Sydney in 2014.  FASHION In the run up to the Royal Wedding, Meghan caused several independent Canadian websites to crash by wearing their brands, including Line The Label, which she wore for her official engagement photos. She caused a 400% increase in traffic to jewellery site Birks, and a 1000% increase in sales to sunglasses brand Finlay \u0026amp Co, just by wearing their products.  Since the Windsor ceremony on Saturday, there has been a 160% increase in searches for Stella McCartney wedding dresses – Meghan’s choice of designer for her evening gown. Richard Haigh, of Brand Finance, says the 36-year-old’s branding power will only continue to soar. “Following the wedding, we estimated that her brand power will be \u0026pound150m a year, which is the same as Kate’s,” says Richard. “Based on our estimate, she could pull in the same kind of brand potential as Kate for the fashion industry.”  Meghan’s appeal could surpass Kate’s at the beginning, as she boosts American as well as UK brands, Professor Jonathan Shalit, who runs InterTalent, says. “The Meghan journey has been a completely phenomenal, unique journey,” he says. “The power of Meghan is quite staggering. I think she could be the biggest fashion brand in the world.” But Jonathan says there may be a shift over time. “I think right now she is the new kid on the block, and Kate is a mother-of-three,” he explains. “But eventually when Meghan has been doing this for a few years, they will both even out.” BEAUTY Down-to-earth Meghan was praised for the natural make-up and “messy bun” she sported on her wedding day, with hundreds of websites rushing to advise others on how to copy her style.  Online beauty brand Memi announced a 65% rise in sales of nude lipsticks since Meghan wore a taupe hue during her engagement interview. She also loves \u0026pound7 Nivea’s Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion to keep her skin moisturised. LIFESTYLE It’s no secret that the Duchess of Sussex loves keeping fit and healthy, reportedly converting Prince Harry to green juices and helping him quit smoking. She’s been pictured in a variety of yoga poses on her now defunct Instagram and loves running around Kensington Palace Green.  Since she was snapped in Kensington’s posh health shop Whole Foods, sales at organic independents and retailers have enjoyed a 9.7% sales jump to \u0026pound359m.  Meghan’s also partial to a glass of wine, noting that her favourite red is the full-bodied and firm Tignanello – which she even named her lifestyle blog ‘The Tig’ after. While the yoga and pilates business brings in \u0026pound812m into the UK economy a year, the new Duchess’s lifestyle choices could see an even greater spike in its popularity. Her wedding alone is predicted to have drawn in an additional \u0026pound500m to Britain’s economy through tourism, travel, hotels and memorabilia, according to Brand Nation. KIDS Friends of the royal couple revealed before their wedding on May 19 that the pair hope to have a baby within a year of getting married.  While there is no doubt that the youngsters would be of huge public interest, they may not attract quite the same frenzy as George and Charlotte, says Jonathan.

The animated speech included themes of love, slavery, Martin Luther King, the Song of Solomon, the Industrial Revolution, poverty, war and, even more love.  Yet, despite the speech being a roaring success with most, it evoked a few giggles among certain members of the Royal Family at the royal wedding last Saturday.  The Duchess of Cornwall was seen sniggering during the 14 minute speech and Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice smirked throughout.   Kate Middleton appeared to give the Duchess of Cornwall a side-eye in what many have speculated was a signal for her to be more respectful.  Zara Tindall, daughter of Princess Anne, also had a very interesting expression after the reverend told the congregation that he would try to wrap up so Meghan and Harry can officially get married. But the Reverend Curry bats off any negativity around it, saying: They were listening in their own way. Emotions should be expanded, he added.  Laugh at me, laugh with me, it is all fine by me. Any way I can steer the message about the love of God, I am glad to do that. During his sermon he started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south.  We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan and their wedding guests.  By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  The sermon at Windsor Castle has made the Chicago-born reverend a minor celebrity across the world - prompting some to claim he used the wedding as an attempt to gain world fame - something he flat-out denies. So humble is the upbeat preacher, that he revealed he was convinced someone was pulling an April Fools joke on him when he was first asked to be a part of the big day.  Speaking on today\u0027s Good Morning Britain previously he said: I thought someone was doing an April Fool on me.   Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, went on to say that he had no idea his speech would be such a hit. He said: I have to admit I had no idea, I really didn\u0027t. I remember thinking to myself, \u0027I hope that\u0027s okay\u0027. And he said he hadn\u0027t meant to overrun so badly - speaking for more than double his alloted time - but he said he seized by the moment and was inspired by the unexpected presence of his late grandmother’s spirit in St George’s Chapel, Windsor.

Tributes have been paid to Malcolm Willis, 41, after he was discovered at the property in Felling, Tyne and Wear, last Saturday. “There were no warning signs - it was out of the blue,” said his brother, Wayne. “I just can’t get my head around it.” He added that his brother was a “normal bloke” who loved footy and a pint. “He was a happy-go-lucky man who would do anything for anyone - even a stranger,” he said.   Escaped prisoner of war gave up his life by going back into Nazi Germany to save his friend  Yet, out of nowhere, Malcolm\u0027s family now have a hole in their lives caused by his sudden passing. Paramedics and police raced to his home to try and save him but it was too late. An inquest is expected to establish how Malcolm, known to pals as ‘Bucko’, died. But Wayne fears his family may suffer even more by never having that answered. “This is just so out of character, and his life he’s been happy and bubbly,” said Wayne. “Last Wednesday he was at a family friend’s funeral and my old brother was speaking to him and he seemed fine. And we had a happy childhood. “Anyone who knew him knew he was a happy-go-lucky lad, and we are in bits thinking, why? “Now we are worried we may never find out.” The tragedy occurred at Malcolm’s Hewitson Terrace home.  Wayne claims his sister had popped to the shops after the wedding, only to receive a call about her brother which worried her. “She came running back up and started knocking on the door but there was no answer,” he said. “She could hear his mobile ringing inside and eventually they’ve tried kicking the door in.” It was then they discovered the “loving” brother. Northumbria Police were called at around 5.40pm to assist with paramedics following a “report of concern”. “Emergency services attended and found an unresponsive man inside the property,” said a force spokesperson.

The plan could see obese office workers miss the rush hour commute, demand an extra large chair or even work from home. A UK government advisor will propose changes at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna as new research shows Brits are among most fat-ist in Europe. Prof Stephen Bevan has advised the Department of Work and Pensions and is a member of Public Health England’s advisory board. He will tell 2,000 medics that obesity should be classed as a “protected characteristic” allowing staff to sue fat shaming bosses.  Prof Bevan, head of HR research at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: “We need to coordinate our efforts so that people who want to work can do so. “It can be working time, it can be having a bit of understanding that someone might need to turn up at 10am because they have trouble with transport or anxiety about transport. “Many employers get away with whatever they want.” Prof Bevan will present a systematic review of research in to obesity workplace discrimination.  It included a major study on “weight stigma” in the NHS .  Another study found one in five Brits said they would object to an obese person marrying in to their family.  A third study by the European Association for the Study of Obesity found more than half of UK doctors thought overweight patients lacked willpower.  One in three said they were too lazy to keep weight off.  Prof Bevan added: “Some people say that obesity is the last characteristic that its still socially acceptable to make fun of .  “We have a scheme in the UK called Access to Work which not many employers know about. “If you are an individual living with a health condition or an impairment you can get support, paid for by the Government to make accommodations. “It could be transport or it could be working from home.”  Another study surveyed 90,573 people in nine countries and found only 47% of Brits believe food addiction is a reasonable explanation. This was lowest other than the US and Germany.

Officers are hunting the driver of the grey Audi A3, which sped off after the horror smash in Edinburgh that left one person dead. The car, which had false number-plates and may have been used in other crimes in the city, was found abandoned in Fife a few hours later. The crash happened close to Maybury roundabout in Edinburgh at about 12.30am yesterday. Witnesses told how the Audi drove over chevron road markings to overtake a number of vehicles, including a bus. It headed on to the oncoming carriageway, causing a BMW to swerve and hit a Peugeot 206, which was travelling in the opposite direction. Emergency services, including 14 firefighters, scrambled to the scene. It is understood fire crews initially believed every driver and passenger had been accounted for – but a victim was later discovered in the wreckage of the Peugeot, which had burst into flames. The BMW’s occupants – a 25-year-old man, 22-year-old woman and five-year-old girl – were all taken to hospital, where they continued to be treated for their injuries last night. The Audi was recovered in Lochgelly Road, Cowdenbeath – near to the local ambulance depot – at about 3.50am. It had been stolen from the Liberton area of Edinburgh on April 17.

Six-month-old Vanellope Hope Wilkins has beaten eight-million-to-one odds to survive the ultra-rare condition. The battling tot has since made incredible progress, thanks to a specially designed jacket she was given to wear which acts as an external rib-cage and protects her heart. Her parents had been told there was next to no hope that she\u0027d live when the abnormality was picked up at a nine-week scan. Mum Naomi Findlay, 31, and dad Dean Wilkins, 43, were advised to terminate the pregnancy but she refused and never gave up hope.  Vanellope\u0027s breast bone had failed to develop normally, causing her heart and part of her stomach to grow on the outside. The condition - called ectopia cordis - is extremely rare and most babies affected have a less than 10 per cent chance of survival. There were only a handful of cases worldwide where a baby has survived the condition and none in Britain. A team of 50 staff were on hand to assist when Vanellope was born by c-section at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester weighing 4lb 7oz at 9.50am on November 22 last year.  Six months on, she is still making an incredible recovery and has now been moved nearer to her family\u0027s home in Bullwell, Notts. She was transported from Leicester Royal Infirmary to Nottingham\u0027s Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham on Thursday. Her day-to-day care will today move to the medical team at Nottingham University Hospitals who will prepare her for going home in the coming weeks. Naomi spoke of her excitement and said she is looking forward to finally getting her baby home.  She added: “I started this journey, what seems like a long time ago now, when I had a scan at nine weeks pregnant. “There have been times when I really didn’t think she would make it, but she has fought so hard. I have been so incredibly lucky to have been surrounded by an amazing medical team. “It has been very hard for me and my other children over the last six months. “I have felt torn between my children, guilty when I am at home with my boys and then guilty when I’m in hospital with Vanellope, so this will be a huge relief and we will start to feel like a real family.

The man and woman were spotted getting rid of bricks and stones by the side of a road. But passer-by - a builder - was having none of it, and filmed what happened on his mobile phone. The video footage of their exchange shows him telling them: Put it back in your car and take it home, you scruffy f***ers! He refused to leave until every last bit of debris was put back into the car. The builder, who asked not to be named, said: I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  It\u0027s disgusting that people think they can go dumping their rubbish on other people\u0027s land - how would they like it in their back garden? There\u0027s absolutely no excuse for it and I wasn\u0027t going to let them get away with it. I had to put a stop to it. The clip shows him pulling up and confronting the pair dumping rubbish on a farmer\u0027s field near Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The builder can be heard asking what are you doing? before the couple seem to try and justify leaving the waste at the side of the road. But he refuses to let the matter, and shouts: Pick it all up and put it back in your car and take it home.  Go on hurry up. You don\u0027t throw it in someone else\u0027s field do you? How would you like it if I thew a load of s*** in your garden? He asks the couple why they don\u0027t take the waste to the tip and when they claim it\u0027s closed, he says: Go tomorrow then! On a number of occasions, the couple can be seen on video trying to apologise for their actions but the builder has no sympathy for them and forces them to carry on picking up their waste. After loading dozens of bricks back into their vehicle, he insists they also move some building rubble dumped at the side of the road. The pair claim the waste isn\u0027t theirs - until the man gets out of his work van and points out it must be as it\u0027s bone dry when it\u0027s pouring down with rain.  Take it to the tip like everyone else, or buy a skip, the builder says. He continues filming the pair as the woman puts on a pair of gloves and fills a black bin bag with rubble, which they load back into their dark blue people carrier. Before they drive away, the couple ask the builder to delete the recording of them fly tipping but he refuses, saying you\u0027ve just been flytipping, I\u0027m going to wait here until you\u0027ve gone. Speaking afterwards, the builder who works from a site nearby, said: It\u0027s just not acceptable. I know there was a bit of f-ing and blinding from me but that\u0027s not a crime. They were fly tipping which is illegal. People are always leaving stuff there - sofas, chairs, building stuff, you name it - but I don\u0027t know what right they think they have.  I don\u0027t understand why they don\u0027t just take it to a tip, it doesn\u0027t cost them anything. I have a works vehicle so I can\u0027t do that and have to pay \u0026pound200 to hire a skip, they\u0027re just being lazy. The builder said there is a refuse tip just ten minutes from the layby where he caught the fly tippers - and claims he followed the couple along a road just a mile or so from it after the incident. He has had a largely positive response form the video, which he says he took to encourage others to step in and stop others fly tipping.

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for southern England for today, tomorrow and Sunday and say heavy showers will hit. Forecasters have warned there is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds this weekend. The thundery showers in places will be mixed with warm sunny spells. Tonight there will be rain across some central parts becoming more sporadic overnight, still with some heavy bursts at times, the Met Office forecasts. Clear spells and patchy fog will be seen elsewhere, but further showers will hit southern England by dawn, perhaps turning heavy and thundery. Saturday is set for scattered downpours with hail pushing into the south, with warm sunshine in between.  Many northern areas will be fine and very warm, after early rain clears Northern England, the Met Office added. Forecasters are warning that, once the rain clears, it could be the hottest early May Bank Holiday weekend ever with temperatures hitting 30C. It will be warmest in the South East but the rest of the UK will experience glorious sunshine as well. The previous record set in late May was 32.8C, which was recorded in Horsham in 1944 on a Monday.  Martin Young, Deputy Chief Meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There is a 50/50 chance we may see the warmest day of the year so far at some point towards the end of the weekend.” If the temperatures do break 30C it will also make it the warmest day of the year, beating with 29.1C taken on April 19 in St. James Park, London. But before it heats up motorists looking to get away today are at risk of heavy rain and thunderstorms. Saturday will be sunny for most, but with the risk of sharp showers for central and southern areas. The heaviest and most widespread showers are expected over south-west England, especially in the afternoon.  Sunday will be sunny for many northern and eastern parts, although there will be thundery showers again for central and southern portions of Britain. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page added: “There is a risk of potentially severe thunderstorms during the Bank Holiday weekend. Saturday: Rain in northern England will ease to leave many fine and very warm. Southern and southwestern areas will see further thundery showers, whilst coasts in northeast Scotland could remain misty. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Very warm over the Bank Holiday weekend with plenty of sunshine, especially in the northwest. Scattered thunderstorms in the south, especially on Sunday. Mist returning to eastern coasts from Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"experts baffled mysterious wolf like","story":"NewsExperts baffled by mysterious wolf-like creature that has been called everything from a werewolf to BigfootAfter inspecting the creature experts said they doubt it\u0027s a wolf as its teeth were too short, front paws abnormally small and claws too large\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Bishop10:12, 26 MAY 2018Updated11:22, 26 MAY 2018NewsBizarre theories have circulated online that the animal could be a werewolf, a young grizzly bear or even a relative of Bigfoot (Image: Montana Fish WIldlife and Parks)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWildlife experts have been left baffled by a wolf-like creature that was shot dead by a farmer. Bizarre theories have circulated online that it could be a werewolf, a young grizzly bear or even a relative of Bigfoot. After inspecting the creature wolf experts have said they doubt it\u0027s a wolf as its teeth are too short, front paws abnormally small and claws too large. The animal came to the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks attention last week after a rancher shot it dead when it came within several hundred metres of his livestock in Denton, Montana.   FWP spokesman Bruce Auchly said it was a young, non-lactating female and a canid, a member of the dog family that includes dogs , foxes, coyotes and wolves.  He added: We have no idea what this was until we get a DNA report back. Theories over what the animal could be have ranged from a coywolf - a coyote wolf hybrid- or perhaps a wolfdog bred in captivity and later released into the wild. Other suggested it could be a legendary Chupacabra but it is too far north for that.  One thing is for sure though - experts are not accepting as a wolf just yet - and DNA test results are not expected back for weeks.  Ty Smucker, wolf management specialist for Montana FWP, told the Great Falls Tribune : Several things grabbed my attention when I saw the pictures,  The ears are too big. The legs look a little short. The feet look a little small, and the coat looks weird. There\u0027s just something off about it.

Little Clara and Cutler, both two, have been inseparable since their mums brought them together when they were only a few months old. Clara\u0027s mother Lana Beaton, 39, and Cutler\u0027s mum Amy Sanders, 43, knew each other growing up in North Dakota, US. But they were never close friends until they both welcomed children with Down\u0027s syndrome within months of each other.   Mum-of-four Lana, who gave birth to Clara in November 2015, sent school teacher Amy a Facebook message after she heard from a mutual friend that her son Cutler, born in February 2016, also had the condition.   The parents arranged to meet in a local Starbucks in April 2016, where Clara and Cutler hit it off and the toddlers have been best buddies ever since. The incredibly cute pair spend at least two days a week together and share their physical, occupational and speech therapy sessions. The mums say bubbly Clara has a positive influence on Cutler, who is a little shy, and is one of the only people who can bring him out of his shell. The pair love playing tag, watching movies and getting up to mischief together. Lana said: “Amy and I knew each other growing up – our parents were good friends.  However, we never really ran in the same circles and as we grew up we lost touch. “A friend of mine came over to see Clara one day and she told me that she was certain that Amy had just welcomed a little boy with DS. “After I found out at 20 weeks that Clara had DS, I joined a lot of the local groups in our area. I thought my connecting with Amy we might be a good support for one another. “I sent her a sensitive message asking her if Cutler had an extra chromosome like Clara and Amy wrote back within an hour. “We met up about a week later in a local Starbucks and we really connected.  We laid the babies out on a blanket and they started touching each other – you could see that there was a connection there between them. Amy said: “It was really amazing to connect with Lana because she’s such an amazing advocate for Down\u0027s syndrome. “We first met up at the bookstore and we brought the babies with us. “Lana is such a calming and confident person and became a great support to me. We arranged some play dates for them both the rest is history.” “Clara is very outgoing and she will tell you what’s what! Cutler is shy and reserved. He admires people from afar but he’s definitely more cautious than Clara.  We try to have play dates as often as we can and they have their speech and occupational therapies together twice a week. “Everybody is blown away by their friendship. Everybody is smitten with them.” Despite her big personality, Clara has faced many medical setbacks. The toddler underwent open heart surgery when she was just three months old and as a result she is fed through a G-tube in her stomach. Clara also lives with Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition that impacts the nerves in her colon making it difficult to pass stool. Although Clara is always in and out of hospital, her mom Lana says she loves watching videos of Culter from her hospital bed.

The area was sealed off and the bottle - which appeared to contain blood - was taken to Son Espases Hospital in the capital Palma before being flown to a specialist centre in Madrid for tests.  The alarm was sounded around 8pm yesterday after the hospital-type specimen bottle was discovered at the block of flats in the Palma neighbourhood of Arxiduc, near the city bullring. Responders in protective suits removed the container and took it to hospital. It was immediately stored at sub-freezing temperatures before its transfer to the mainland for analysis.  The bottle had the words ‘Filoviriade Ebola virus ARN’ on it. ARN would be RNA in English, with Ebola and rabies being among the RNA viruses that cause human diseases. Local reports said it had been discovered on top of residents’ postboxes just inside the ground-floor entrance to the flats. A resident called emergency services after discovering it. The area it was found in was cleaned and disinfected as a precaution following its removal. Neighbours living in the apartment block were prevented from entering or leaving their homes for several hours while it was made safe. It was not immediately clear this morning when the liquid inside the container would be tested so officials could find out whether the scare could be linked to a medical gaffe or if it was a sick joke. Police are expected to interview residents living inside the apartment block - on a crossroads near a caf\u0026eacute and a pizza restaurant - as part of a full probe into the find. Nursing assistant Teresa Romero contracted Ebola after cleaning the room of Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo at Madrid’s Carlos III Hospital. He died from Ebola in September 2014 after being flown back from west Africa for treatment.

Dramatic images show the killers tossing and turning during an intense battle in the river.  The croc eventually comes out on top, with the viper clamped and thrashing beneath his powerful jaws before being gobbled down by his prey .  The dramatic incident was spotted at Yala National Park in Sri Lanka by Rishani Gunasinghe, a Patent Technology Specialist.  Rish said: “This was one such occasion. We came across a small waterhole by the main road that was home to a small croc, which most Jeeps seemed to ignore and pass by, crocs not being rare in the island. “However, there was something that initially appeared to be small and white close by, which sparked our interest and made us stop for a closer look. “Soon the croc took the white thing into its mouth and lifted it revealing a snake, and first, seeing only the underbelly and the enormous size, we assumed it was a python.  “After a few quick photographs, I noticed the unmistakable chain of dorsal spots and realized it was actually a Russell\u0027s Viper.” The Russell\u0027s Viper is one of the most dangerous snakes in all of Asia, accounting for thousands of deaths each year. Once bitten, people reportedly experience pain, swelling, vomiting, dizziness, blood clots and kidney failure. Rish added: “Seeing a Russell’s viper in the wild, one of the deadliest snakes in the world, was indeed a treat, but to see a croc with one of possibly record size, and the superb spins and tosses displayed by the croc in trying to kill and devour the viper, was quite a show and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.

Sadie and Jamie Stonehouse were told their daughter must cover up and wear another top over her dress by staff at Little Years Nursery School in Winnipeg, Canada. The preschool said because the straps on Lola Stonehouse’s outfit were less than two inches wide, it goes against their internal policy. Mum Sadie has hit back, telling a local news channel it has put her in the uncomfortable position of having to explain to Lola why the dress isn’t allowed.   Speaking to CTV News , she said: “She\u0027s not going to understand.  “She\u0027s going to think that maybe she did something wrong, when she very much didn\u0027t. So now she\u0027s going to be questioning her own body.

Lola’s mum picked out the light dress from her daughter’s closet and thought it looked perfect for the hot weather. Teachers had a different view and declared it was “inappropriate for school” and that next time she’d have to wear a shirt.

The discount chain has been slammed for its decision to use factories in China, Turkey and Myanmar - which all have an appalling history with gay rights. Homosexuality is technically illegal in Myanmar, formerly Burma, with punishments ranging from 10 years to life in prison.  While it is not illegal in China, authorities and social networking companies in the country have attempted to clamp down on LGBT people online .   And in Turkey gay people are routinely subjected to violence and persecution, including when Turkish riot police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to break up a rally staged by the LGBT community in Istanbul .    Primark are now selling RuPaul Drag Race t-shirts - but only in these few stores  People were protesting against a ban on Trans Pride and were calling for justice for transgender woman and LGBT activist Hande Kader after she was found dead in a forest.  LGBT activist Steve Taylor told The Sun : “Imagine living in a country where you have to hide your sexuality, for fear of violence, reprisals or worse. Imagine working in Primark’s factory, churning out this stuff.  “That is not acceptance without exception, by anyone’s standards.”  The range of rainbow-themed t-shirts, caps and accessories - produced in partnership with LGBT charity Stonewall - were unveiled this week, reports Pink News .   Stonewall will receive 20 percent of the proceeds - despite cutting ties with London Pride last year after a reported fall-out between the charity and organisers. Three Primark stores near Gloucestershire - in Cardiff, Birmingham and Bristol - are stocking the Pride range. Jason Potter-Peachey, chairman of Pride in Gloucestershire, said: It gives the impression to Jo Public that you can buy this and the money will go to Pride. It\u0027s launched in time for Pride season and they have branded it as \u0027Pride-ready\u0027. It\u0027s a bit of a kick in the teeth on a local angle.  Mr Potter-Peachey, membership director of UK Pride Organisers Network, added that Stonewall has little involvement in Pride events, reports Gloucestershire Live .   A Primark spokesman said: “We take LGBT rights very seriously which is why we have created a range of Pride products with Stonewall, one of Europe’s leading LGBT rights charities. We will donate 20 per cent of the sales of these products to support Stonewall’s important work, which includes campaigning globally for LGBT rights. The items in our Pride range are sourced from a variety of different countries, and as is the case with all our products, the country of origin is clearly indicated on the label.” Stonewall said in a statement: When Primark decided to launch a summer Pride range we were proud and pleased that they approached us about a partnership. They want to work with us to help embed long-term, generational change for LGBT people in the UK and internationally.

Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked.

has welcomed a host of new restaurants in recent years – and one of its most famous streets could be set for a food boom.Much like the Waterfront, Reform Street – previously considered the city’s answer to Savile Row – is in the midst of a transformation.The street has been maligned for many years, with many empty units blighting the once bustling thoroughfare.But several planning applications have been put forward for new eateries to join the others that have arrived in the street in recent years.Project Pizza (previously Project Pie), German Doner Kebab and Asian-themed restaurant Dai Pai have proved popular destinations.John Brandon, manager at Project Pizza, said he was encouraged by the latest applications and believes the restaurant trade could hold the key to reviving the street’s fortunes.He said: “When we first opened it was great, we had a great flow of customers.“There has been something of a steady decline in the last year or so but it’s good to see there have been quite a few applications put forward.“I don’t know if it’s the case that people’s tastes are changing and we’re in competition with other parts of the city which are seeing more footfall.“I think the restaurant sector is where we’re going to see a big difference in Reform Street.“You’ve got the shopping centres nearby, so I think if it’s turned into almost like a food court set-up with lots of different options then that could really give us a boost.”Permission has been granted by city planning chiefs to convert the former Swinton Insurance shop at 37 Reform Street into a coffee shop and takeaway.The Little Things Cafe will offer hot drinks and baked treats such as cupcakes and macaroons, along with paninis, soup and sandwiches.Lisa Shek, who submitted the application, said the menu could later expand into “Asian baked products”.In August, the Tele reported that listed building consent had been granted for an application to open an independent Scottish-themed diner.Plans were put forward to create 20-25 jobs at the eatery at the former Jessops camera shop.The restaurant would deliver “traditional and contemporary Scottish cuisine”, according to documents submitted to council chiefs.Mr Brandon envisages even more interest in restaurants as the overhaul of Dundee’s Waterfront progresses.He added: “As far as I’m concerned, the more restaurants the better.“It helps everyone if there are different businesses and options, so that could help it become the place to be for food.“I think we’re going to see a difference in the future once things start to come together with the V\u0026ampA and the Waterfront.“I do think they should be investing in Reform Street to try to clean it up and make it a lot more attractive.“We’ve got a lot of empty units at the moment but it’s good that people are at least prepared to try to open up new places down here.”Community figures and councillors have regularly called for out-of-the-box thinking to fulfil Reform Street’s potential.Alison Henderson, chief executive of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce, believes there is a growing trend for people to look for things to do in the city centre.She said: “Whether it’s going to The McManus or coming out of the office at lunchtime for a coffee, independent businesses are great for the city, and its centre, so it’s absolutely to be welcomed.“Hopefully people will support the street and it will get the footfall that it needs.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

costs could soar to over 20m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of Dundee’s planned new stadium development could soar to well over £20 million due to access requirements.But while original estimates of the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone that will use the stadium, the associated commercial developments and the wider road network,” said a spokesman.“We’re working with the developer to get absolute clarity on their proposals and the potential impact on issues like vehicle access to and from the site.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million). There\u0027 little that can be done to increase revenue from learning, which relies on Scottish Government grants.
