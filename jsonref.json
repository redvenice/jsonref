While it is hoped the vaccination programme will offer good protection to many, the more cases there are the more severe disease, hospitalisations and deaths there could be in those unable to be vaccinated or where vaccines haven\u0027t worked.Is it more deadly?Probably not, but we don\u0027t know for certain. PHE said there was insufficient evidence to indicate the Indian variants cause more severe disease, while experts suggest that the high mortality in India is more likely the result of high infection levels and its healthcare system being overwhelmed.What about vaccines?Again, we don\u0027t know for sure but the signs are good. Scientists are testing whether the new variant is capable of \u0027immune escape\u0027, meaning antibodies created after vaccination or a prior infection may not stop a person becoming infected.There is some laboratory evidence that the mutations are \u0027escape mutations\u0027 suggesting they could make vaccines less effective. However, scientists say reinfections are likely to be mild compared to primary infections, suggesting the strain is not more deadly. Research has shown current vaccines continue to provide good levels of protection against all the existing variants.BioNTech this week said the Pfizer vaccine will not need tweaking to protect against current variants. And an updated jab by Moderna successfully neutralised South Africa and Brazilian variants in lab trials.What next?Door-to-door testing is under way in infection hotspots such as Bolton to detect further cases in a bid to stop the strain from spreading. Everyone living within specific postcodes is asked to get a PCR test, even if they do not have any symptoms. But while experts say this is finding cases, they are less confident it is enough to stop the spread.

Eleven patients were confirmed to have died within 28 days of a positive test, the same as the previous day.Blackburn with Darwen Council in Lancashire yesterday claimed jabs would be offered to all over-17s, after infection levels doubled in a week, but later changed its mind and said the vaccines would be offered only to those age groups which had been invited to come forward by the NHS.But neighbouring Bolton – which has the highest infection rates in the country – last night pleaded with the Government to be allowed to administer jabs to all adults.David Greenhalgh, the council\u0027s Conservative leader said: \u0027Send us more vaccinations and allow us to vaccinate 18 years-plus now. That is the answer, not further restrictions.\u0027Other known hotspots include Bedford and Sefton in Merseyside. Britain\u0027s national outbreak remains generally flat, with another 2,657 more coronavirus cases and 11 deaths.The Prime Minister said yesterday: \u0027It is a variant of concern, we are anxious about it.\u0027Speaking at a primary school in Ferryhill, County Durham, he said: \u0027There is a very wide range of scientific opinion about what could happen. We want to make sure we take all the prudential, cautious steps now that we could take.

Here’s the full story: GFG Alliance owns Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 steel workers in the UK. It employs 35,000 people at metalworks across the world. It was one of the largest borrowers from Greensill, the supply-chain finance company which collapsed earlier this year. In a statement, the SFO says: Pressure has been growing on the SFO to investigate GFG’s practices, and the way in which supply-chain financing (or ‘reverse factoring’) has been used to raise money from invoices. On Tuesday, the UK’s financial regulator said it was “formally investigating” the circumstances leading to Greensill’s collapse. Nikhil Rathi, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) chief executive, said some of the allegations facing Greensill were “potentially criminal in nature”.  In a letter to the Treasury Committee, he said: This money will help 5,000 of its staff learn new skills to help them get a job outside Amazon, and “boost the skills and employability of British workers”. Adult education, and lifelong skills, is a serious issue following the pandemic.

Amazon says it is opening a new ‘parcel receive centre’ in Doncaster, Yorkshire, along with new ‘fulfilment centres’ (warehouses where staff assemble customer orders) in Dartford, in Kent, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and Swindon, Wiltshire, each creating over 1,300 jobs. It’s also hiring 700 more staff for a new fulfilment centre in Hinckley, East Midlands. This will create “thousands of new permanent roles on teams including engineering, HR and IT, health and safety, finance, and those that pick, pack and ship customer orders”, the company says. It’s also creating corporate roles in offices in London, Manchester, Edinburgh, and Cambridge. Amazon says it will cover a range of areas, including fashion, digital marketing, engineering, video production, software development, cloud computing, AI and machine learning.

It comes after Singapore reported 24 new local cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, the highest number since July last year.

Our main Covid-19 liveblog has all the latest: Investors seem to be a more optimistic mood, after a rough week which saw the Footsie briefly hit a five-week low yesterday, before rebounding. But mining stocks are dragging on the index, hit by the drop in commodity prices. Kyle Rodda of IG says the markets finished a turbulent week on a positive note. Copper prices are on track for their first weekly loss in a month, Reuters says. It’s still extremely high, with three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange trading over $10,100 per tonne in London (levels last seen in the 2011 commodities boom). But Reuters flags that worries of tightening credit could potentially cap demand: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation fears are easing today as commodity prices fall back from their recent peaks. Prices dropped after officials in the city of Tangshan, a key steel producer, warned factories to maintain market order. They warned that any factories engages in illegal acts -- such as collusion, manipulating prices, fabricating information, hoarding or driving up prices -- would be “strictly investigated and dealt with in accordance with laws and regulations.”  Other commodity prices are also cooling, with copper dipping back from its record highs.  Oil is also weaker, with crude prices dropping the most in a month yesterday. Brent crude is back below $67 per barrel, for the first time since the start of May. So after a turbulent week dominated by worries about inflation, the markets seem to be finishing on a calmer note today. Wall Street rallied last night, and European markets are expected to make gains this morning. Yesterday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey tried to calm anxiety about rising prices, after US inflation hit a 13-year high last month. US central bank policymakers have also been insisting that they’re in no hurry to raise interest rates.

This will be incredibly tough for Chelsea.Their league record: 37 matches played with 31 wins 6 draws and 0 losses. One match away from an invincible season. He contributed 4 goals and 2 assists for West Ham in April as his resurgence continues.Few players have embodied Liverpool’s travails this season as faithfully as Alexander-Arnold. One minute you’re a virtual unknown the next you’re one of the hottest footballing properties on the planet and the taker of perhaps the most famous corner in history the next you’ve lost your England place and everyone has basically agreed that you can’t defend. This is a familiar cycle of boom-and-bust, one that has claimed many a talented 22-year-old in the past. But somehow over the last few weeks, something seems to have stirred in him: a fortitude and resilience that we perhaps expected to see, but not necessarily this soon. Dean Smith has lauded Barkley’s attitude but has no plans to turn his loan move into a permanent transfer. “We never really had any decision to make,” says Smith. “He’s got two years left on his Chelsea contract, I believe. The deal was always to bring him in for the season. We wanted a high-calibre player on loan to add to our quality that we’d signed permanently. He started the season like a house on fire and then, with the Covid break after his injury, he’s probably been as inconsistent as we have as a team. But his future for the next two years is at Chelsea and we haven’t had any discussions about that and I think it would be wrong to do so, since it was a one-year loan.” From Nick Ames: “For Leicester, a first-ever cup final win would reassert the sense, five years after their league title win, that they are here to stay as a club capable of winning major honours. Their continued presence around the top end since 2016 has, in many ways, been just as impressive as that Claudio Ranieri-inspired triumph. Leicester continue to make a mockery of the idea that a “big six” exists in anything bar inflated egos, and they can prove that once again on Saturday.” This has come after a tumultuous season in which Ward’s team contested the FA Cup semi-final and survived relegation but also sent a letter criticising their working conditions. From Louise Taylor’s article in April: “When I walked through the door last August, with the opportunity to manage in the BFAWSL for the first time, I couldn’t have predicted what the next year would look like. It’s been some journey and one I’m immensely proud of.” “I’ve been so fortunate to work with a group of players who have delivered every single day, taught me so much and are a credit to the Club and the BFAWSL.” “This year will live with me forever, from our first league win at Reading, to reaching the FA Cup semi-final and the late goals that secured our safety.” “All fantastic memories that have been made possible by this unbelievable group of players, and ultimately we achieved what many people said we couldn’t.”The men’s team will also wear this kit next season. All three teams will simultaneously be in action on Sunday at 17:30 BST. Atletico Madrid will be at home to 11th place Osasuna, 9th place Athletic Club host Real Madrid and Barcelona will face 8th place Celta Vigo at Camp Nou.There is, of course, a lot going on in and out of the Premier League this week.

Doctors, public health experts and opposition parties believe that low adherence to the request to self-isolate has been a major flaw in Britain’s response to the pandemic and allowed coronavirus to spread. One recent study found that almost half of those displaying symptoms did not bother to stay at home, often because they could not afford to lose income from not working. Under the government rules up to 30 guests can attend a reception or celebration at a Covid-safe venue that has been allowed to open, an increase from a maximum of 15 people who have been allowed at such events since 12 April. Physical distancing between people who do not live together is not required. Dancing is however advised against due to the increased risk of transmission, although the couple are allowed to have their first dance.  Whether guests across the country will remain in their seats en masse remains to be seen but the guidance stresses that people should still be careful, stating:  Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Good Morning Scotland:  She said the arrival of new variants in the UK was not inevitable and was a result of a “failed border policy”, pointing out that areas which have had comprehensive border restrictions such as Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and south-east Asia have not imported many of these concerning variants. The coronavirus variant B.1.617.2, first identified in India, has been designated as a “variant of concern” by Public Health England because it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the variant detected in Kent last year, known as B.1.1.7, which is now dominant in the UK. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said the situation in Glasgow is being monitored “very closely”, with cases in the city at 70.9 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 May, according to the latest data yesterday. Moray currently has the highest rate in Scotland at 98.1 cases per 100,000 and is unlikely to join the rest of the country by dropping down a level under the Scottish government’s five-tier system as restrictions ease on Monday.Asked why 21 June could be in doubt, he said:  The Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said he would not welcome local lockdowns to combat the spread of the India coronavirus variant. He told Sky News:  Speaking about rising cases in Bolton, he said the government needed to go further and use vaccine supplies to inoculate the younger working-age population and student population. Asked whether people will be able to hug a family member outside of their household bubble or extended household, he replied:  Therefore, plans to allow smaller events to reopen, as well as relaxing rules on people meeting have been “paused”, he added, speaking to Sky News. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: But Monday’s easing of restrictions would still go ahead despite concerns over the variant first found in India, he told LBC:  Speaking to Sky News, he stressed there was currently no evidence that the India variant “escapes the vaccines or is more severe in its impact on people”. But Hunter said it seemed to be “a little bit more resistant from the early indications”, indeed “a little bit more resistant than the Kent variant”, though not as resistant as the South African variant. The top story this morning surrounds concern that the spread of a variant first found in India could derail the planned easing of restrictions in England, with officials considering “flexing” the country’s inoculation campaign and adopting a policy of “surge vaccinations”. This morning, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said that younger people in areas where there is a surge of the variant initially identified in India could be vaccinated sooner. He told Sky News: Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said surge vaccination would “possibly” work, but that it was “not an easy question either way”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:  Meanwhile, surge testing is under way in areas of the north-west of England where cases involving the Indian variant of coronavirus are on the increase. The “variant of concern” has been detected in Bolton, Greater Manchester, as well as in Blackburn, Lancashire, and Sefton in Merseyside, which have all seen rates rise rapidly. Blackburn with Darwen council initially said on Thursday that it would be offering vaccines to all over-18s from next week following the increase in cases, but later said that, although additional vaccine clinics are being set up, the jab would only be offered to those eligible under current government guidance. The area’s director of public health, Dominic Harrison, tweeted that the authority had asked the NHS to “surge vaccinate” but the request was refused. In Bolton, the area with the highest rate of cases, with 553 new infections in the seven days to May 9, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR Covid testing has been offered to 22,000 residents.

So, seeing as spring is all about fresh starts, how about a bedroom revamp with a focus on choosing some light, bright bedding for a more restful night’s sleep as the nights get warmer? When looking for new bedding, Marks \u0026amp Spencer is a good place to start. “We see ourselves as experts in sleep, so we are always looking for new products and innovations to bring to the market to help our customers get a great night’s sleep,” says Karen Thomas, head of design home and beauty at M\u0026ampS. “We see sleep health in the same way as we see physical health or dietary health, so a really important part of how we develop products is by solving sleep problems or sleep preferences with innovative new products that improve your sleep.” The M\u0026ampS Comfortably Cool range of filled bedding, sheets, duvet covers and mattress protectors use a Tencel-rich mix, which helps to keep your body temperature cool. Tencel is sustainably crafted from the eucalyptus tree and wicks moisture away from the skin, regulating your body temperature to give you a cool night’s sleep in luxurious comfort. If you are sweltering under your current duvet, it’s worth upgrading to one from the body sensor range of duvets, pillows and mattress protectors. These include specially developed technology to keep you warm when it’s cool and cool when it’s warm, while drawing moisture away from the body to create a drier environment for a more comfortable night’s sleep. And it’s not just about temperature. Getting the darkness levels in the room right is also key to a good night’s sleep. When it’s dark, our bodies release the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin, however, light interrupts its production, which signals to our bodies it’s time to wake up. Even the LED light from an alarm clock can affect your quality of sleep. Ideally you want your room to be so dark that you can’t see from one end to the other. Now the mornings are lighter, you may find yourself waking earlier than you need to, particularly if your blinds or curtains are thin or light-coloured. To ensure your room stays dark for the hours you are sleeping you should consider curtains with an extra blackout layer, such as M\u0026ampS’s cotton bee print curtains or fern pencil-pleat black out curtains. By buying curtains that are lined with a blackout material, you don’t have to limit your curtain choice to dark colours. The next important thing you can do to ease yourself into a good night’s sleep is to turn your bedroom into a haven. Create an environment you find restful and relaxing by clearing away clutter, removing blue-light emitting technology and choosing colours and patterns that lift your mood. Why not opt for some statement bed-linen in fashionable botanical prints, such as this palm-frond bedding set, or this bright jungle one. Leaf patterns bring some of that spring growth indoors and can help you to feel calm. “Creating a calm bedroom can be done by just making simple changes,” says Jaya Myra, a mind-body wellness expert and bestselling author. “Keep the space as clean and decluttered as possible. A bedroom that is too full of stuff – including furniture – does not contribute to good sleep or relaxed energy. Secondly, have at least three things out in the open in the bedroom that make you smile.” This can be as simple as a photograph, a book and fresh flowers. Scent can also have a calming effect and can set the scene for a restful night’s sleep. Lavender has long been known to have sleep-inducing properties and you will find this oil as well as eucalyptus, vetiver and jasmine in the sleep diffusers from M\u0026ampS’s Apothecary range. There are other sensory products in the range to make your room a scented sleep space, including the sleep room spray and the calm scented candle, which is crafted with sweet orange and lavender essential oils. And if it works for babies and toddlers, it can work for you: have a soak in a warm, scented bath to relax your body before bed. Stir in a handful of Tranquil bath salts from the Apothecary range, which contain hemp seed oil to aid relaxation and then, once your fingers begin to shrivel, dry yourself off with the softest Egyptian cotton towels. These towels bring the spa experience into your home and are available in a rainbow of colours, which won’t fade because they are treated with stay-new technology. Suitably cocooned, you can return to your revamped bedroom, certain of a good night’s sleep.

Especially when armed with budget-friendly homeware collections, such as the take on 2021’s biggest decor trends from Marks \u0026amp Spencer. “If you’re keen to refresh tired decor without creating too much work for yourself, the best place to start for a quick win is a fresh lick of paint,” says Alexandra Laird, interior design manager at the Burbeck Group. But you don’t have to stop there. “If replacing furniture is over budget, bright accessories and artwork can be easily added to a room to bring in some new colour.” “A key trend that’s easy to implement on a moderate budget right now would be a modern minimalist look with a Scandi furniture scheme. Use a neutral palette with pops of bright colour added through your furnishings and artwork throughout,” she adds. Make a start by lifting your living room with an emerald green sofa scattered with ochre cushions, or brighten up the bedroom by mixing soft grey bedding with rugs and throws in ocean blue and vibrant mustard. “Keep the rest of the room fairly neutral as a backdrop to really make your bold and bright colours sing,” says Kate Hatherell, founder of the Interior Designers Hub. A simple glass-topped coffee table, for example, is a perfect finisher – style and function without adding to the noise. If you’re looking for a softer palette that’ll calm, start with neutral colours to set the tone. This year’s shades – cream, grey, navy, duck egg, soft pink – all work well together and have the added benefit of timeless appeal. “A good way to add some warmth to neutral shades without disrupting that feeling of calm would be clever use of lighting,” says Laird. “Use table lamps and floor lamps in the corners of a room to add a cosy feel. I’d also bring in textured or warm coloured throws and cushions to maximise that feeling further. Again, you can play around with artwork and soft furnishings to add in warm colourings where needed.” Carry the same peaceful palette into the bedroom with a watercolour bedspread and crisp white linen. A top tip: natural wood accents complement almost all colour combos and, according to interior designer Katharine Pooley, also tick the box for this year’s rustic-inspired trend. “Embracing traditional interiors can help to create a comfortable atmosphere, even if your home is newly-built and therefore perhaps lacks more historical features,” she says. Try rustic-look furniture such as an oak-topped coffee table, or maximise the light with a metal lampshade. If the rustic look isn’t for you, how about heritage inspired classics reimagined for today? We’re talking modern use of colour, and striking scale and pattern. From Pinterest to the high street, you’ll see myriad nods to elegant florals, rich botanical prints, plush fabrics and plenty of polished glassware. Carrying on the taste for vintage twists, art deco references are also back on trend. Looking forward to inviting friends and family over for dinner again? Now’s the time to spruce up your glassware, or add an ornate mirrored tray to your drinks cabinet. Heading down the vintage decor route does come with a warning from the experts, however. “Be careful when working with vintage-inspired pieces that you don’t aim to simply reproduce the era,” says Pooley. Laird agrees that you’ll want to keep things on the right side of Gatsby-era with this trend. “The best way to stop the room from looking too old fashioned and keep it modern is to use contemporary key pieces of furniture, such as the sofa in the lounge, or the bedroom setup, and then add vintage-inspired lamps, accessories and artwork around this,” she advises. Nail it with tactile textures such as Egyptian cotton, luxury velvet and smooth sateen, and sprinkle in a few delightfully retro nods such as cotton velvet cushions, butterfly or hummingbird details and marble accents.

The challenge now is to extend those much loved interiors into the garden to create an exciting new living space. Somewhere to relax with family or entertain friends You don’t need a massive budget to create an outdoor area infused with your personality and taste. Whether you like the relaxed Scandi vibe with its casual blues palette or are aiming to be right on trend with up to the minute rich tropical mixes, we’ve got it covered. A great starting point is to choose outdoor furniture that is built to last, such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s new Porto furniture range. These durable sofas, chairs, stools and loungers are made with powder-coated metal frames to withstand the worst of the British weather and are finished with stylish wooden armrests and contemporary grey cushions. They provide the perfect neutral backdrop for you to add pops of colour to, such as these bright teal leaf-patterned outdoor cushions made from a water-resistant fabric that will withstand the occasional rain shower, or water fight. If you want to make a more bold colour statement, opt for furniture such as these bright yellow Lois garden armchairs, which will brighten a dull corner of any garden, or how about a raspberry coloured parasol, such as M\u0026ampS’s Shanghai parasol, which has UPF50+ protection from UV rays to ensure you can lounge without adding lines to your face. “Don’t be too heavy-handed with lots of contrasting blocks of colour though,” says London-based stylist Katie Cordell. “Carefully layering tones, with the odd bright zesty pop, will create a more harmonious space.” Once you have your furniture sorted, it’s time to add decorative detailing. Choose a mix of flowering and evergreen plants and shrubs to soften the space and add fragrant colour. Tall plants, such as bamboo, can be used to create a natural screen for your seating area, or you can use trellises with climbing plants such as honeysuckle or jasmine to provide shade and define the area. Choose pots and planters that match your cushions, such as this teal planter in the Lois collection, or opt for neutral greys, blacks and browns. If you find too many pots untidy, then you can build deep planters using railway sleepers or reclaimed bricks to give your outdoor living area a more walled-in feel. To extend the use of the space well into the evening you might want to add the Madeira fire pit, which has a mosaic border for a hint of the Mediterranean. You can then use lamps and lanterns to create ambient outdoor lighting, such as this quirky glass butterfly lantern, which takes a tea light, or this large wooden hurricane lantern, which will take a full-size candle. Consider buying candles that contain citronella to keep the bugs away. “Hanging small lanterns in shrubs or trees will create a magical, fairytale scene,” advises Cordell. Even with the fire pit lit, you might still want to provide some blankets for your guests to wrap themselves in if the night is chilly. These lightweight herringbone throws come in a variety of colours and can be draped over knees or wrapped around poncho style. Whether you opt for picnic-style cold nibbles, a classic barbecue feast, or sausages on sticks cooked on the fire, you will need some outdoor dinnerware to create a cheerful spread. M\u0026ampS’s rainbow picnic range is made out of clear plastic with a multi-coloured tint and even comes with a matching drinks dispenser that you can fill with punch or homemade lemonade. Alternatively go for bold and playful prints, such as these bamboo and melamine jungle dinner plates, which depict bright exotic scenes to make you feel as if you have travelled farther than your own back yard. “Or bring the jungle inside and mount these plates on the wall,” says Cordell. “They would make a fabulous addition to a child’s bedroom – all you need are some simple plate hangers to attach them with.” And, of course, not everyone has the luxury of having their own outdoor space, but there are plenty of other ways you can bring a hint of a garden into your home. You could plant some herbs in a window box to create a minute kitchen garden on your window sill, or buy some colourful geraniums to provide a potted, fragrant table display. If you don’t feel you’ve got green fingers, or don’t want the hassle of looking after living plants, you can opt for faux ones. Gone are the days when fake plants looked, well, fake. These days artificial plants are very convincing and can be a great solution for a room that doesn’t get much light, such as a north-facing bedroom or a hallway. This floor-standing artificial tropical plant is a real statement piece that would require heat and humidity were it real, but will merrily suffer draughts and drought in its artificial form. Consider contrasting plants that have soft, feathery leaves, such as ferns, with harsher, more angular plants, such as aloe. “A simple shelf filled with plants above your bed is an excellent way of bringing some greenery into your bedroom,” says Cordell. “These fake plants are ideal for a position where it’s harder to water.” Alternatively you can look to bring leaf prints into your soft furnishings, or even your wallpaper, to bring the mood-boosting power of plants into your home.

The health system is also struggling with a recent spike in coronavirus cases and deaths. An air raid siren is also warning Israeli communities near the Strip to take cover after a Hamas drone managed to penetrate Israeli airspace.

The ICC’s Fatou Bensouda said she would press ahead with her inquiry even without the cooperation of Israel, which accuses her office of anti-Semitic bias, and is not a member of the treaty-based court. “These are events that we are looking at very seriously,” Bensouda said. “We are monitoring very closely and I remind that an investigation has opened and the evolution of these events could also be something we look at. “This is just to alert people on all sides not to escalate, to be careful to avoid taking actions that will result in the commission of (war) crimes,” Bensouda said in a reference to the current hostilities. In March, after nearly five years of preliminary inquiries, the ICC said it was opening a formal investigation into suspected war crimes committed by both the Israeli military and Palestinian armed groups.Israeli attacks on Friday are targeting senior Hamas officials and the militant group’s network of tunnels inside the territory, the Israeli military said.

They often tie big stones to the bodies and throw them in the river,” he told AFP by phone. “Others don’t even bother with that and just throw the bodies in as they are. It has become common practice here,” he added. “Some are just burying their dead in shallow graves and not even waiting to see if crows or dogs feed on them.” In the past month no medical team has visited the village. The sick are staying at home taking “herbal concoctions”, Ahmad said. Clinics, if people can travel to them, are low on beds, medicines and oxygen. “People have been left to die,” he added. “This is the India which is hidden from everyone.” Indian health ministry data show 4,000 deaths and 343,144 infections over the last 24 hours. But a lack of testing in many places meant the official count omits many deaths and infections, prompting experts to estimate the real figures could be five to ten times higher.Read more here: Washington Post – Leana Wen: The CDC shouldn’t have removed restrictions without requiring proof of vaccinationAFP report that the Irish attack has been blamed on international criminals and was said to be targeting healthcare records, but officials said patient safety was not at risk. While Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) has said that coronavirus vaccinations are going ahead as planned, there have been some knock-on effects in the healthcare system.  The Rotunda maternity hospital in Dublin said that “due to a serious IT issue”, it was only admitting emergency cases and women who are at least 36 weeks pregnant. Hospital chief Fergal Malone said the attack had targeted computers storing patient records. Life-saving equipment is operating fine, “there’s no problem for patient safety”, and the hospital has switched to backup paper records, he told RTE. “But obviously throughput will be much slower,” he said, urging out-patients with routine appointments to stay away. HSE chief executive Paul Reid said the attack in Ireland was “an internationally operated criminal operation”, and the authority was working with police, the army and its major IT security providers. “We are at the very early stages of fully understanding the threat,” he told Irish broadcaster RTE, adding it was trying to “contain” the issue.The San Francisco-based company said the recovery in bookings is being led by families and small groups, as opposed to solo travellers, while there has also been a jump in bookings for longer-term stays. “Increasing numbers of guests are discovering that they do not need to be tethered to one location to live and work,” Airbnb said.

It is business as usual for China – the country says it carried out about 12.6m vaccinations yesterday.  The number from Russia stands out slightly though. I normally don’t blog it every day as the case numbers are nearly always the same, in a range of 7,000 to 8,000 cases. But it has caught my eye this morning with a slight tip up to a reported 9,462 new Covid-19 cases. Reuters report that the government coronavirus task force said 393 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 115,116. However, it is worth noting that the federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and says Russia recorded about 250,000 deaths related to Covid-19 from April 2020 to March 2021.“We have taken the precaution of shutting down all our IT systems in order to protect them from this attack and to allow us to fully assess the situation with our own security partners,” the Health Service Executive said on Twitter, AFP report. “We apologise for inconvenience caused to patients and to the public and will give further information as it becomes available,” it added, stressing Ireland’s coronavirus vaccination programme was unaffected and “going ahead as planned”.He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “Within your own household bubble or extended household you’ll be able to make decisions about who you hug and who you cwtch. “But we’re not yet thinking, largely because of the Indian variant, we’re not going to change the rules about people more generally. We expect the two-metre social distance to be sustained.” PA Media reports that asked whether people will be able to hug a family member outside of their household bubble or extended household, Drakeford replied: “I’m afraid you have to wait a little bit longer. We can change the rules, we don’t have to wait two or three weeks. If we get advice that says it’s safe to move ahead on that, we’ll do so as soon as we get that advice. “But we are just pausing to make sure that we have the best possible evidence about the newly emerging risks that there may be because of (the) Indian variant.”"},{"url":null,"title":"academic on 154 000 salary with no work to do accuses president of maynooth","story":"Maynooth University president Prof Philip Nolan, who is also chairman of Nphet’s modelling group on Covid-19. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins President of Maynooth University Philip Nolan has been accused of acting as “judge, jury and executioner” in dealing with a row between two senior academics which has left one professor on an annual salary of €154,000 without work for almost five years.Prof Robert Galavan told the Labour Court on Thursday that Prof Nolan – who is also chairman of the National Public Health Emergency Team’s modelling group on Covid-19 – decided the dispute would be resolved by moving him into an area of academia where he had no expertise and did not support his suggestion for mediation between the parties.Prof Galavan, who holds the chair in strategic management in the college’s school of business, claims he has had no effective work since 2016 after being placed on secondment by the president to the Kennedy Institute for Conflict Intervention, despite having no expertise in mediation.Unfair processHe told a resumed hearing in the case that he was “dragged through a process that only the president had control of” and was subject to an unfair process.The senior academic is appealing a ruling by the Workplace Relations Commission that he had not made a protected disclosure under the terms of the relevant legislation.Prof Galavan (55) claims he is being penalised for making protected disclosures in 2014 in which he raised concerns with the head of the school of business, Prof Peter McNamara, about governance and health and safety issues.The hearing was told that Prof McNamara, who had succeeded Prof Galavan in the role, had made a formal complaint that his predecessor’s combative and intimidating behaviour was undermining the work of the school.Prof Galavan said he only became aware of the complaint when he received a letter “out of the blue” from Prof Nolan in December 2014 and there had been no attempt to resolve the issues between him and Prof McNamara informally.Done nothing wrongProf Galavan said the president told him in May 2016 he had done nothing wrong but the only way to resolve the dispute was by moving him to the Kennedy Institute for three years.Although Prof Nolan had subsequently promised to meet him annually to review the situation, Prof Galavan said he had not met him since.The hearing resumes on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"A new model for Irish agriculture \u0026ndash based on the understanding that farming has to change \u0026ndash is now requiredDublin Climate Dialogues will produce recommendations for UK, host of COP26Europe Letter: More than 50 green laws and reforms on EU schedule in next 18 months"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.

Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: PA Wire UK research has found that giving the PfizerBioNTech booster after 12 weeks rather than three produced a much stronger antibody response in older people.A study led by the University of Birmingham in collaboration with Public Health England found that antibodies against the virus were three-and-a-half times higher in those who had the second shot after 12 weeks compared with those who had it after a three-week interval.Most people who have both shots of the vaccine will be well protected regardless of the timing, but the stronger response from the extra delay might prolong protection because antibody levels naturally wane over time.Dr Helen Parry, a senior author on the study at Birmingham, said: “We’ve shown that peak antibody responses after the second Pfizer vaccination are really strongly boosted in older people when this is delayed to 11 to 12 weeks. There is a marked difference between these two schedules in terms of antibody responses we see.”In the first weeks of the vaccine programme the UK took the bold decision to delay administering booster shots so that more elderly and vulnerable people could more quickly receive their first shots. The move was controversial because medicines regulators approved both the PfizerBioNTech and OxfordAstraZeneca vaccines on the basis of clinical trials that spaced out the doses by only three or four weeks.Researchers from Oxford University showed in February that antibody responses were more than twice as strong when boosters of their vaccine were delayed for 12 weeks. But the latest study is the first to compare immune responses after different timings with the PfizerBioNTech jab.The scientists analysed blood samples from 175 over-80s after their first vaccine and again two to three weeks after the booster. Among the participants 99 had the second shot after three weeks, while 73 waited 12 weeks. After the second dose, all had antibodies against the virus’s spike protein, but the level was 3.5 times higher in the 12-week group.The researchers then looked at another arm of the immune system, the T cells that destroy infected cells. They found that T cell responses were weaker when the booster was delayed, but settled down to similar levels when people were tested more than three months after the first shot. Details are published in pre-print form and have yet to be peer reviewed.“This study further supports the growing body of evidence that the approach taken in the UK of delaying that second dose has really paid off,” said Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England. “Iniduals need to really complete their second dose when it’s offered to them because it not only provides additional protection but potentially longer lasting protection against Covid-19.”–  News and Media "},{"url":null,"title":"kildare replaces donegal as county with highest rate of covid 19","story":"Dublin has the third highest incidence rate at 198 per 100,000 people. Photograph: Alan BetsonKildare now has the highest incidence rate of Covid-19 in the State, following a drop in the spread of the virus in Co Donegal over the last two weeks. Donegal previously had a 14-day incidence rate of 300 per 100,000 people, close to double the national rate at the time. Co Kildare has since overtaken Donegal as the county with the highest infection rate of Covid-19, with an incidence of 251 per 100,000. The current 14-day incidence in Donegal, which is the rate the virus is spreading at, stands at 240 per 100,000. Dublin has the third highest incidence rate at 198 per 100,000 people, and the national incidence is currently 129, according to figures up to May 11th. Last week, Newbridge, Co Kildare had the fourth highest local Covid-19 incidence, 484 per 100,000, according to figures broken down by local electoral area. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the recent fall in the rate of the virus in Donegal had been a result of a “strong response” from local communities. Previously public health officials had expressed concern at growing rates of the virus in Donegal. In late April, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan criticised clear non-compliance with public health measures in the county. He said people were doing “the kind of things that even the dogs on the street in Donegal know shouldn’t be happening.” Catherine Murphy, Social Democrats co-leader and Kildare North TD, said the rate in Kildare had been “consistently high” throughout much of the pandemic. There had been a number of outbreaks in recent weeks, one traced to a school, and another to a construction site for Intel’s new manufacturing facility in Leixlip, which was linked to 70 cases. “We know there was a big outbreak in Intel, and we know it takes time to break the chain, it takes time for it to be contained,” Ms Murphy said. There was a need for a “targeted approach” from public health to the high rates in the county, she said. Kildare also had a “disproportionately young population,” with rates of Covid-19 generally higher among younger cohorts, she added. Cathal Berry, Independent TD for Kildare South, said the county had always had a “background high level” of Covid-19, due to several reasons. There were a number of meat processing plants in the county, and its proximity to Dublin and large commuter population was also a factor in the high incidence rate.There had been some delays getting the mass vaccination centre in Punchestown up and running, meaning it was “a little later than others” vaccinating people, he said. Mr Berry called for pharmacists in Kildare to be brought into the vaccine rollout on a trial basis, ahead of a decision to utilise pharmacies in the vaccine programme nationwide.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"opening of travel bubble between britain and ireland planned","story":"Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin is to present to Government a tourism advisory group’s report  aimed at getting the State ready to restart the tourism sector. It also recommends the removal of restrictions on UK visitors, thus effectively also allowing residents of the Republic to travel freely to Britain. Photograph :Gareth ChaneyCollinsIrish residents could be allowed to travel to Britain on holiday without restrictions within weeks as part of plans to open a travel bubble between Ireland and Britain. It is understood that Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin is due next week to present to Government a tourism advisory group’s report that contains a number of recommendations aimed at getting the State ready to restart the embattled inbound tourism sector. The report by the Recovery Oversight Group for Tourism calls for the Government to publish a plan no later than the end of May that would specify when curbs on inbound travel would be relaxed. It also recommends the removal of restrictions on UK visitors, thus effectively also allowing residents of the Republic to travel freely to Britain. Foreign travelThe plan would sit independently of any European Union “green certificate” travel scheme, which is due to be discussed at Cabinet next Tuesday. It is thought likely that this scheme could open up foreign travel to participating countries by Irish citizens by the end of June or possibly mid-July. The rationale being considered by the Government for British travel is that from May 17th, non-essential travel between Britain and the North will resume under UK rules in any event. With an open border between the Republic and the North, those visitors would be able to freely travel throughout the island anyway.Meanwhile, the Department of Transport indicated that the Government is expected to consider plans next week for the revision of mandatory hotel quarantine arrangements as well as moves to ease restrictions on travel.A spokeswoman for Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said last night that he and his departmental officials were working closely with other departments “on plans to open up international travel including aviation”.More than 120 people in mandatory hotel quarantine have tested positive for Covid-19 since it was introduced, according to new figures. Of the 127 detected cases, 42 involved a variant of concern, according to the Department of Health. This week, the variant first discovered in India was officially designated a variant of concern. Up to last week, 20 cases had been identified in Ireland.However, rapidly increasing increasing rates of vaccination mean more people are protected against serious illness. The vaccine rollout continues to accelerate and passed the two-millionth dose milestone yesterday. HSE chief executive Paul Reid expects up to 280,000 people to be immunised next week. He said at the HSE’s weekly Covid-19 briefing yesterday that “joy and confidence emerging” was emerging from vaccination centres.One in seven adults are now vaccinated fully, while 37 per cent have received one dose.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"portobello plaza closed for weekend to prevent unacceptable behaviour","story":"Rubbish in the Portobello area of Dublin last Satuday after crowds were enjoying the good weather and drinking in the area.

Photograph: iStockEradicating vulture funds. Freezing rents. Thousands of affordable homes costing under €230,000 in Dublin. Each of the Opposition parties have made eye-catching promises about how they would solve the housing crisis if they were in Government. Are these policies credible or doable? The  went through the main pledges with a number of experts and academics.Affordable and social housingSinn Féin’s success in last year’s general election can partially be attributed to its strong stance on addressing the housing crisis.On affordable and social housing, the party has promised to significantly increase capital investment in public housing to “deliver the largest social and affordable housing programme in the history of the State”.This would involve delivering 20,000 public homes each year, prioritising the use of public land. Is this feasible? Sinn Féin has been considering the impact of the pandemic on the targets it set during the election last year. Housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin says the figure of 20,000 may not be reached in the first year but whatever is lost initially would be made up in subsequent years.Under their plans, affordable rents would be set at prices of between €700 and €900 per month in Dublin and lower elsewhere. Affordable purchases would be set at prices of €230,000 or less in Dublin and lower elsewhere. Eligibility for affordable housing would be set at a gross income of €55,000 for a single person and €85,000 for a couple and would be reviewed annually. Public housing would be delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.Experts who spoke to The  said that while the policies are ambitious, there are many pitfalls and potential problems.They can be summarised as follows:All of these complex problems present major stumbling blocks to the plans, they say.The issue of the overall costings for the Sinn Féin plan was also raised a number of times.Sinn Féin has promised an additional €6.5 billion for the construction of these 100,000 homes.Half of those homes are already budgeted for under the National Development Plan. Sinn Féin also propose to add another 10,000 social homes to this lot and then a further 40,000 affordable homes, split evenly between affordable sale and rental, from that pot of cash.The party says the cost to the exchequer for the 20,000 affordable sale homes will be €40,000 per unit.These figures are based on calculations from sites such as the Ó Cualann development in Ballymun, Dublin. In an example such as this, a site is provided by the State, for a low and nominal cost. It is often also serviced, meaning connected to utilities, at no cost to the builder although there is a cost to the exchequer. Development levies are also waived.Multiple housing experts raised concerns about the feasibility of replicating this across the country. Some say developments like Ó Cualann may not be scalable nationally because it is not a given that the site can or will be provided on the same terms and at the same density. The “waived” fees still effectively have to be paid for by the taxpayer, they say.The remaining 20,000 homes, the affordable rental homes, could be built for €236,000 on average under information used by the party. Taken in the round and including inflation the total plan comes to just under €6.5 billion but experts have said given the number of pitfalls and complexities already outlined, sticking within budget could be a tall order indeed.There is another aspect of the party’s policy that rankles with those who keep a keen eye on the market. Sinn Féin says that when it comes to buying a €230,000 affordable home, it will be a leasehold, not freehold. So you might own the property but the council owns the land and will have a say over the future sale of the property.The question has been posed: why would a family buy a house knowing that they could never sell or rent it on the private market?“You own the house. You renovate it, extend it, amend it, pass it to your kids. They pass it to their kids. But the land on which the house rests is not your property. It is not just the first purchaser than gets the affordability, every subsequent purchaser gets it. Some people say that is not real home ownership. What I say is who else is offering you a home in Dublin for €230,000?” Ó Broin asks.RentalWhen it comes to the rental market, almost all of the Opposition parties were united last year in calls for rent freezes. Labour also favoured a scheme which would count rent payments towards deposits for houses which was proposed by Labour. Experts believe the latter proposal should be doable.Academics and housing policy wonks differ on whether any move for across the board rent freezes would be constitutional. Many agree, however, that linking rents to inflation and providing increased security of tenure could provide an adequate middle ground.‘Cuckoo’ fundsThe big issue of the month has been the existence of so-called “cuckoo funds”. Sinn Féin has said it would remove tax exemptions ued by investment funds. “They would have to pay capital gains tax. We’d also increase their stamp duty,” Ó’Broin said. Labour has also said it believes a targeted increase to the stamp duty rate would act as a deterrent once the rate increase was big enough. Industry sources are sceptical and say the rate would have to be quite high and going beyond a certain level could potentially leave the State in a legally tricky position.Some experts point towards a 2019 Department of Finance study which states that “at a local level there have been instances of investors purchasing large blocks of stock, removing some of those units from the owner-occupier segment of the market.However, at a national level, or in terms of the broader Dublin market, the advantages of institutional investment are manifold, broad-based and beginning to yield positive outcomes for the Irish housing system.” Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is expected to bring proposals to this end next week.Other promisesThe People Before Profit housing policy says that housing should be treated as a universal public service the same as health and education. They would abolish the income threshold limits to “make public housing available to more people on a broad range of incomes with rents set at a percentage of take home pay”. Experts say the ultimate problem with such a system would be the cost attached to it with higher taxes being necessary across society. That, they say, is a whole other debate."},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry royal life a mix of being in the truman show and the zoo","story":"The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, (pictured with wife Meghan and son Archie) has appeared to criticise the way he was raised by his father Prince Charles. Photograph: Henk KrugerAFP via Getty Images.The Duke of Sussex has appeared to criticise the way he was raised by his father Prince Charles, discussing the “genetic pain and suffering” in the British royal family and stressing that he wanted to “break the cycle” for his children.In a wide-ranging 90-minute interview, Prince Harry, who is expecting a daughter with Meghan Markle and is already father to Archie, likened life in the royal family to a mix between being in The Truman Show and being in a zoo.Speaking to the American actor Dax Shepard for his Armchair Expert podcast, Harry was promoting his new Apple TV+ series about mental health, The Me You Can’t See, with Oprah Winfrey, which launches next week.Discussing his childhood, Harry said: “There is no blame. I don’t think we should be pointing the finger or blaming anybody, but certainly when it comes to parenting, if I’ve experienced some form of pain or suffering because of the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered, I’m going to make sure I break that cycle so that I don’t pass it on, basically.“It’s a lot of genetic pain and suffering that gets passed on anyway so we as parents should be doing the most we can to try and say: ‘You know what, that happened to me, I’m going to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.’”He said that in his 20s, he realised he did not want the royal “job”, having seen what it did to his mother, Princess Diana.Business modelHe said he had been forced to “grin and bear it”, but added: “I’ve seen behind the curtain, I’ve seen the business model, I know how this operation runs and how it works. I don’t want to be part of this.“It’s a mix of being in The Truman Show and being in the zoo.”The Truman Show is a 1998 satirical film starring Jim Carrey, where the main character becomes aware he is secretly the star of international hit reality TV show. Harry also told how he started therapy after a conversation with his wife, Meghan, who “saw it straight away”.“She could tell that I was hurting and that some of the stuff that was out of my control would make me really angry, it would make my blood boil.”He said therapy had helped him “pluck his head out of the sand” and made him realise he needed to use his privileged position to help others.Of Prince Charles, he said: “Suddenly I started to piece it together and go ‘OK, so this is where he went to school, this is what happened, I know this about his life, I also know that is connected to his parents so that means he’s treated me the way he was treated, so how can I change that for my own kids?’“And well here I am, I moved my whole family to the US, that wasn’t the plan but sometimes you’ve got make decisions and put your family first and put your mental health first.”He added that Meghan, now knowing the life of a royal, would say: “You don’t need to be a princess, you can create the life that will be better than any princess.”IncognitoHarry also revealed that he met up with his future wife in a London supermarket in the early days of their relationship and the couple pretended not to know each other. “It was nice with a baseball cap on looking down at the floor, walking along the street and trying to stay incognito.”He described the freedom he felt living in Los Angeles: “I can actually lift my head and I feel different, my shoulders have dropped, so have hers, you can walk around feeling a little bit more free, I can take Archie on the back of my bicycle, I would never have had the chance to do that.”As the podcast was released, it emerged that Madame Tussauds had moved waxwork models of Harry and Meghan away from other members of the House of Windsor and placed them in the attraction’s Hollywood zone with waxworks of other celebrities. - Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view uk election can things get better for labour","story":"Are the UK\u0027s Labour Party facing an existential crisis?

Senior judges have given Natalia Potanina, his ex-wife, the green light to pursue the 60-year-old through the English courts – despite the fact the Russian courts orced them seven years ago.If her financial claim is successful, the orce payout will be the most lucrative in British legal history and worth up to £10 billion.The  understands that Mrs Potanina is seeking half her ex-husband’s fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at just under £20 billion, making Mr Portanin the world’s 55th richest man and, according to reports, the wealthiest documented billionaire in Russia.Mrs Potanina, 59, was awarded in the region of £30 million by a Russian orce court in 2014 but the Court of Appeal, sitting in London, ruled that she is entitled to bring a new claim here.“Everything is, however, relative. The wife\u0027s settlement represented only a tiny proportion of the vast wealth of this family, all of which had been accumulated during this very long marriage.”She said that since Mrs Potanina was still in her 50s at the time, then “arguably the sum she received would nowhere near meet her long-term needs when considered by reference to the lifestyle to which she had long been accustomed”.Mrs Potanina, who made London her permanent home in 2017, could be in line for a payout of as much as £10 billion if she wins the orce battle.That sum would easily dwarf the previous English record for a orce settlement of £453 million that another Russian billionaire, Farkhad Akhmedov, was ordered to pay his ex-wife. The world’s biggest payout is the $38 billion that Jeff Bezos reportedly paid to his ex-wife MacKenzie.The court heard that Mr Potanin and Mrs Potanina were childhood sweethearts who met as teenagers and married in their homeland in 1983 when both were in their early 20s. The couple, who have three children together, began married life impoverished but, in her ruling, Lady Justice King noted that Mr Potanin “accumulated vast wealth” in the 1990s at the fall of communism.Mr Potanin, according to Forbes, is worth just under £20 billion having made his fortune acquiring a stake in Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of refined nickel, during Russia’s privatisation in 1995. He currently owns a little over a third of the company, according to Forbes, as well as other assets. Mr Portanin reportedly owns three luxury yachts and spent $10 million on his daughter’s wedding in the south of France. He is described as an “ice hockey buddy” of President Putin.The Potanins’ long marriage faltered with Mr Potanin claiming the couple separated in 2007 although Mrs Potanina insists they did not split up until 2013, by which time “unbeknown to her”, Mr Potanin had a child with another woman – now his second wife. Mrs Potanina said her husband’s announcement that the marriage was over was a “devastating bolt out of the blue” and led to a Russian orce in 2014 and a further “blizzard of litigation”.In the English stage of their long-running court battle, Mr Potanin had won the first round by blocking his ex-wife\u0027s attempt to bring a case against him in London in November 2019, when a High Court judge ruled that her claim was an example of orce tourism.But, in Thursday’s ruling, the Court of Appeal cleared the way for Mrs Potanina to bring what could be the highest-value orce case in English legal history.Lady Justice King ruled the decision to prevent Mrs Potanina from making an application for financial relief in England should be overturned, saying: The matter will therefore proceed to trial.The judge added: The fact that the appeal has been allowed and that the wife may therefore proceed to make an application... for financial relief should not be taken by either party as an expression by this court of any view as to the merits or otherwise of that application.Mrs Potanina previously argued she was the victim of a grave injustice and was not given a fair share of the marital wealth because of her ex-husband\u0027s wealth, power and influence in Russia.Her lawyers told the Court of Appeal in January that Russian courts deal with orce settlements by equally iding the parties\u0027 assets, but do not share any assets owned through trusts or other corporate vehicles.This meant Mrs Potanina\u0027s attempts to get half of the assets ultimately owned by her ex-husband have been fruitless, the Court of Appeal said.In the court\u0027s ruling, Lady Justice King – sitting with Lords Justice David Richards and Moyland – said the High Court wrongly overturned a previous decision allowing Mrs Potanina to bring a claim for financial relief in the English courts.Lady Justice King concluded: In the event that the parties cannot reach some sort of compromise in this long-running and expensive litigation, the case will be determined with the benefit of oral and, I anticipate, expert evidence by a High Court judge in due course.The legal battle pits the two doyennes of orce lawyers against each other. Baroness Shackleton, who represented Sir Paul McCartney, is acting for Mr Potanin while Frances Hughes, who has spearheaded a number of groundbreaking orce cases, has been hired by Mrs Potanina.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dame cressida dick admits streets london not safe everyone time","story":"The Met Commissioner has admitted the streets of London are not safe for everyone all of the time and has said there is far too much violence against women and girls.Dame Cressida Dick said she would like the capital to be much safer but insisted her officers were working hard to drive down violence.Asked whether she agreed with Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, who said in March that the streets were not safe for women and girls, Dame Cressida told LBC\u0027s Nick Ferrari: I wouldn\u0027t put it as strongly as that.She went on: I think we have been hearing from women and girls not just in the past few months but for years. I have made dealing with violence against women and girls a core part of my service as a woman ever since I joined...I care deeply about thisI absolutely understand that many women feel fearful and also that on occasions we see horrible, horrible events in which serious crimes are committed against women when they are simply out.She went on: I think there is far too  much violence against women and girls, of course there is, I would like them to be very much safer of course I would.The streets are not completely safe for everybody all of the time and we would love to live in that world. Unfortunately there is far too much violence against women and girls.

but many questions remain regarding their optimal delivery for provision of effective and sustained immunity.This is the first time antibody and cellular responses have been studied when the second vaccine is given after an extended interval.This research is crucial, particularly in older people, as immune responses to vaccination deteriorate with age.Understanding how to optimise Covid-19 vaccine schedules and maximise immune responses within this age group is vitally important.Corresponding author Paul Moss, professor of haematology at the University of Birmingham and principal investigator of the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, said: The enhanced antibody responses seen after an extended interval may help to sustain immunity against Covid-19 over the longer term and further improve the clinical efficacy of this powerful vaccine platform.Our research findings may be important in the development of global vaccination strategy as extension of interval of the second vaccine dose in older people may potentially reduce the need for subsequent booster vaccines.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz has replaced anneliese dodds labours","story":"In the week that Boris Johnson confirmed that the next step in England\u0027s roadmap out of lockdown can go ahead, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines.It\u0027s been a tough week for Sir Keir Starmer after a disastrous defeat in the Hartlepool by-election and the loss of more than 300 English council seats in last week\u0027s local elections.

He said: “We will share the data with the nation, to demonstrate that those tests have either been met or otherwise. That is what data, evidence-driven policy is about.” The four tests are:That the vaccine deployment programme continues successfully That evidence shows jabs are sufficiently effective in reducing hospitalisations and deaths in those vaccinated That infection rates do not risk a surge in hospitalisations which puts unsustainable pressure on the NHS That the Government’s assessment of the risks is not fundamentally changed by new iants of concern Mr Zahawi said trials of vaccinating all adults in multi-generational households have been successful and could be a tool for use in areas where the iant is surging. The multigenerational household trials, in Luton and in Slough and where, have been good, they have been successful, which is why I think itaposs a tool in our armoury, he told BBC Breakfast. Asked why this was not being implemented now, he said: The clinicians will make those sorts of recommendations, the decisions, and we will flex the vaccination programme accordingly.  He said Mondayaposs easing of restrictions in England will still go ahead. We think that the road map for Monday remains in place, because the vaccines are delivering, and vaccines are keeping people out of hospital and, of course, away from severe infection, he told Sky News. He added that the Government was confident this could continue but said officials would continue to monitor the situation.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSBBCPaul HunterNadhim ZahawiBBC BreakfastHospitalsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"decision portugal letting british tourists","story":"NewsDecision on Portugal letting British tourists in should be made immediately says MPHoliday hopefuls face uncertainty after the nations government decided to extend its \"state of calamity\" until at least May mirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He said: Itaposs really important that this year whether you are planning a holiday in Portugal or where is to also check both our foreign office advice but also the destination - whether itaposs Portugal or Iceland or any of the other green list countries, to check that.Because it is a rapidly changing situation. UK holidaymakers are currently prohibited from entering the European Union. Holiday firms have reported huge demand for trips to Portugal following the publication of the green list. This morning, Portuguese MP Cristovao Norte told the BBC: We are today going to make an urgent inquiry asking thegovernment whether or not the English travel can come to Portugal next Monday because we are three days ahead from th and no one is sure what is going to happen. Our vaccination process is going steadily and it is important a decision is taken immediately. The message is clear: there are no reasons, nor political or scientic reasons to maintain restrictions for travel from the UK to Portugal.  EasyJet has added , extra seat to its flights serving green tier destinations, while Tui plans to use aircraft which normally operate long-haul routes to accommodate the surge of people booked to fly to Portugal. Thousands of British football fans are hoping to travel to the city of Porto for the all-English Champions League final between Manchester City and Cha on May . Uefa previously confirmed that , tickets would be made available to each of the finalists, with the final capacity limit at the Estadio do Dragao still to be fixed. Portuguese cabinet office minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said in a briefing on Thursday she had no information to give yet when askedrestrictions on travel from the UK would soon be lted. Ms Vieira da Silva said under current plans for the Champions League final, a series of restrictions to British fans would apply. As well as the limit on ticket sales, fans will have to fly in on charter planes, arriving and leaving on the same day, the BBC said.Ms Vieira da Silva described the plans as a bubble situation, with fans passing through a separate zone at the airport and needing a negative coronavirus test before travelling. Guidance from the Department of Transport warns that many green list countries still have restrictions on UK travellers. It advises passengers to check all entry and testing requirements and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Officetravel advice for Portugal before booking travel. It is understood the UK Government has been in discussion with Portuguese representatives this week to discuss plans to unlock travel between the two countries.

During the state of calamity, entry to Portugal is only allowedyou are a ing resident, according to information on the FCDO website.  Entry to non-residents is limited to essential purposes from the UK and other non-EU countries, and EU or European Economic Area countries where the case rate is above  cases per , residents. Essential purposes are defined as travelling to live with immediate family members or professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons. To enter Portugal, proof of a negative Covid- test taken with  hours of departure is required.

This could very quickly amount to millions of people, with cases of the iant having more than doubled in the last week, with prevalence highest in the North West and London. The government on Thursday night published an action plan to battle the iant, which experts fear is % more transmissible than the Kent strain that plunged the UK into fresh lockdowns in December. It came after Boris Johnson conceded that the government were anxious about the new iant.Data from Public Health Englandshows a rise in cases from  to , this week in the UK, with the agency saying cases were rising in the community and it was assessing the impact and severity of the iant.Are you worried by the Indian iant  Let us know in the comments below One response being considered is bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the situation was being monitored carefully and the Government will not hesitate to take further actionnecessary. The Prime Minister has not ruled out local lockdowns being necessary to contain the spread of the virus.There have also been calls to widen the rollout to all adults over  in badly-affected areas. Dr Susan Hopkins, Covid- strategic response director at PHE, said: We need to act collectively and responsibly to ensure that iants do not impact on the progress we have all made to drive down levels of Covid- and the increased freedom that brings.  In Bolton, which has one of the highest case rates of the iant in the country, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR Covid testing has been offered to , residents. A vaccine bus has been set up to increase uptake among those who are eligible and a rapid response team of  nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has been sent in. Meanwhile, surge testing has been deployed in Sefton, Merseyside, after cases of the Indian iant were confirmed in the Formby area, with anyone over  who lives, works or studies in the area urged to take a PCR test. Measures have also been brought in where, including in parts of London. Mr Hancock said: We are monitoring the situation very carefully and will not hesitate to take further actionnecessary.  It is imperative we all continue to be vigilant, andyou live in one of the  areas where weaposve introduced surge testing, make sure you get a free PCR test. And everyone whoaposs eligible needs to come forward and get a jab. Mr Johnson said the Government was anxious about the iant and there is a range of things we could do, we are ruling nothing out. Despite the spread of the Indian iant, Mr Johnson said there was nothing that dissuades me from easing Englandaposs lockdown on Monday or the further steps towards normality on June . But he added there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do themthat is the advice we get. Local lockdowns are only expected to be usedevidence suggests they are necessary to contain or suppress a iant which escapes the vaccine.  Although the Indian iant is thought to be highly transmissible, vaccines are expected to be effective against it. Any attempt to impose new restrictions is likely to meet with fierce resistance. Tory Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of MPs, said: Why on earth would we lock down when the vaccines continue to break the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham warned against attempts to impose local measures. Mr Burnham, who battled the Government over Manchesteraposs restrictions last year, told the BBCaposs Newscast: We would be very concerned about the Government putting Blackburn, Bolton, anywhere to be honest, under local restrictions when the rest of the country is unlocking. PHE said cases of the iant and any clusters are being rapidly investigated by local PHE teams, councils and NHS Test and Trace to identy the contacts of those who test positive.

Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. People are being encouraged to go for testing and to self-isolateneeded. PHE said there were many small dispersed clusters in London and it was working with borough councils on a local approach, which had already been effective at driving down iants. Dr Hopkins urged people to follow local public health advice and said: Cases of this iant are rising in the community and we are continuously monitoring its spread and severity to ensure we take rapid public health action.

It is calculated to be % more transmissible than the dominant form of the virus and has taken root in a growing number of areas across the country. Unless checked, there are fears that it could delay the lting of the final lockdown restrictions in England, due on June . To try to contain the iant, one idea is for mass vaccinations in the affected areas for everyone aged  and over. This was a demand made by Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, more than  hours ago. It is not the first time the Government has been behind the curve when it comes to Covid.  It took over a month after the Indian iant became a cause for concern for the country to be added to the red list of banned travel destinations. If we want to protect people’s lives and save our summer then everything must be done to prevent this strain from spreading. Cam off it.. David Cameron today provided a reminder of why few will regret that he is no longer Prime Minister. His evidence to the Treasury select committee was glib, slippery and unconvincing.  He asked MPs to believe that his relentless lobbying was for the public good rather than a greedy attempt to get rich quick. He claimed the lobbying rules he introduced had proven to be satisfactory when the reality is that his behaviour only came to light thanks to diligent journalism. And he denied any knowledge that the company he was working for was on the brink of collapse. He either knew about the state of Greensill’s finances or he could not be bothered to find out. Either way he looks a fool. His record in Government was inglorious and ignominious his record since leaving office is even more shameful.

Chemo and radiotherapy can really damage your chances of becoming a natural birth parent. I remember, my younger brother Sean needing to go to St Mary’s in Manchester when he was just  to ‘supply’ some of his sperm. The fact that he didn’t drive yet and our mum and dad had to take him absolutely broke my heart in two. I hated that he was so bloody young and the fact that mum and dad knew what he was going to be doing in that room, it felt so utterly s***. Poor Sean. I’ve spoken with ladies who have been left infertile, or without a womb or oies to create a little human. It’s just so unfair - and the treatment is barbaric in some ways.  Before Ivy, I had miscarried with my first ever pregnancy at  weeks.  weeks probably sounds early to some people, but I had literally known from week  and was delirious with excitement. Trying to contain myself when it came to telling people and buying things and eyeing up new prams. But then one day at work, sitting at my desk I felt it My teeny tiny human was gone already. It’s awful to go through this and yet so many of us do without ever really talking about it. When we fell pregnant again months later, the joy I’d had the first time round was definitely still there, but it was tinged with a big dark cloud of fear, in case it happened again. Thankfully, Ivy was born perfectly healthy in spite of my cancer diagnosis just two weeks earlier. Because we had to move pretty quickly to have my mastectomy and bring Ivy’s birth on early, we weren’t given an option to freeze any of my eggs - plus we wouldn’t have qualied for financial help as we already now had a child.  To be honest, another baby wasn’t important to me in the slightest at that moment in time, all I wanted was to live so that I could love the baby I already had. Plus, my labour had been horric and I remember telling Michael “I’m glad I can’t have any more because I am never going through that again!!” Before long though, I had that yearning for another baby. I missed Ivy’s kicks in my tum and the peachy fuzz of a newborn babe. Trying again for another baby was scary but I’ll save that conversation for another day. Ultimately though, we decided we were too scared to get pregnant again as my breast cancer had been fuelled by my pregnancy hormones. I couldn’t bear to go through nine months of fear and then potentially my cancer ing so we decided to do something we had always talked about - adopt!  After a pretty long process, we were finally approved in November . In January  whilst waiting to be matched with a little boy, my cancer came back and this time, I was told it was no longer curable. Obviously, I refused to accept that and after a second opinion, more treatment, surgeries, diet changes etc, I somehow got to ‘no evidence of disease’ and although I still have an incurable diagnosis, we’re hoping that by staying on lelong chemo, the bugger won’t come back! So we were given the flippin’ go ahead to adopt!!! We were finally matched with a baby boy who was literally our light at the end of the most terrying tunnel. Something we had been told was no longer possible WAS possible - I still pinch myself now! Some of the things I’d really like to try and get across to anyone reading this is the language used around adopted adoptive families. I spoke with Adoption UK recently and some of the terminology used around adopted families is just not okay. Here’s a few we’ve encountered: At least you didn’t have to go through labour!Some women would do anything to experience a natural birth, myself included. It’s hard not to make light of it sometimes, i know. But instead, you could simply congratulate them as you would any other new parents.Send him back!This is unreal. Can you imagine year child hearing this and feeling a sense of not belonging or feeling as though he doesn’t belong. If you feel the need to say something about their behaviour, just go with whatever you would say to a child who isn’t adopted - easy!My sister’s a weirdo, I think she must be adopted!So many of us are guilty of using this phrase and it’s clearly not meant as an insult - but think about how an adopted child overhearing this might feel  “Am I a weirdo  Am I strange  Is that why I was put up for adoption ” There are so many scenarios they could have going on in their little heads, so just try to keep it at “my sister’s a weirdo.”His birth parents didn’t deserve him anywayWe have heard this so many times - it doesn’t make us mad, we just hate the idea of Bill feeling somehow ashamed of where he came from. When strangers are passing judgement on the people that brought him into the world, it can bring a sense of stigma with it. We never want him to feel like his birth parents were bad people - and that he’s ‘lucky’ to have us. We’re bloody lucky to have him!Can we see some photos of his birth parents.Nope! They’re very private to us. We know how easy it is to judge a book by its cover. People might try to see similarities in his birth parents or think they look a certain way and therefore - they judge! This is something we never want Bill to experience, so the photos are for our eyes only, thank you very much.There are so many reasons children are taken into care but what we learned in our training was that almost every single parent doesn’t want to give their child up.And that is heartbreaking, no matter what the circumstances are. For a parent to have a child taken from them is horric. We obviously have to look at the bigger picture and remind ourselves that it was in the best interests of the child. Just because a birth parent can’t look after a child, doesn’t always make them bad people. They could be too young, or have learning dficulties which prevent them from taking good care of their baby. They could be a product of their environment addicted to drugs or alcohol, violent, homeless. So please try not to wonder too much about the background of our children, because all you need to know is, he’s our child and we love each other.

The travel industry has been left in limbo after the Portuguese government opted to extend its state of calamity until at least May . There was a surge of bookings to the popular holiday hotspot after Downing Street announced it was one of  destinations on its aposgreen listapos this time last week. It meant quarantining for  days was not necessary onhome from May  when non-essential foreign travel is no longer banned.But guidance published on the Portuguese Governmentaposs website yesterday stated ministers had approved a move to continue the current level of lockdown. The situation is set to be cleared up later today. There are scores of direct flights from the UK to Faro, Lisbon, Porto and Madeira all departing on Monday, which are now all in doubt. Tui has  flights due to depart for Portugal between May  and . These include  to the Algarve, a popular destination for UK summer holidays.Are you booked to travel to Portugal next week  Let us know at webnews@mirror Skyscanner, the flight booking , said that ticket sales had surged  per cent, with most reservations for flights this month. TUI has said: We will only take people on holidayFCDO travel advice allows and borders are open. We therefore await an update from Portuguese officials. Should both of the above not be in place on the th May we will cancel flights and offer customers a full refund, or let them change to another holiday for free. Flights to Portuguese airports from Britain were its top three bestsellers at the weekend. Britons are currently banned from travelling to any EU countries for non-essential reasons. Portuguese officials were under the impression that was being lted by Brussels on Sunday- but the European Commission is reportedly not meeting until next week to discuss it, according to the Times. According to the BBC, Portuguese Cabinet office minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said in a briefing on Thursday she had no information to give yet when askedrestrictions on travel from the UK would soon be lted.Work is going on and as soon as there is a decision it will be announced, but no decision was taken in this cabinet meeting, she said. Ms Vieira da Silva said under current plans for the Champions League final - due to take place in Porto on May  - a series of restrictions to British fans would apply.  As well as the limit on ticket sales, fans will have to fly in on charter planes, arriving and leaving on the same day, the BBC said.Ms Vieira da Silva described the plans as a bubble situation, with fans passing through a separate zone at the airport and needing a negative coronavirus test before travelling.Guidance from the Department of Transport warns that many green list countries still have restrictions on UK travellers. It advises passengers to check all entry and testing requirements and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Officetravel advice for Portugal before booking travel.  It is understood the UK Government has been in discussion with Portuguese representatives this week to discuss plans to unlock travel between the two countries. The Government is also in talks with the European Commission on how to safely reopen travel routes on the continent, the PA news agency understands. During the state of calamity, entry to Portugal is only allowedyou are a ing resident, according to information on the FCDO website. Entry to non-residents is limited to essential purposes from the UK and other non-EU countries, and EU or European Economic Area countries where the case rate is above  cases per , residents. Essential purposes are defined as travelling to live with immediate family members or professional, educational, health or humanitarian reasons. To enter Portugal, proof of a negative Covid- test taken with  hours of departure is required. Those without proof of a negative test can be refused permission to board a flight, or may be forced to quarantine in government-approved accommodation upon arrival.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonEuropean UnionBBCDepartment for TransportEuropean CommissionUEFA Champions League FinalPoliticsCoronavirusHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"amazing lottery winner finds out","story":"AdvertorialAmazing!!!

Kash Mahmood, , was described as audacious, corrupt and criminal after confiscating hundreds of thousands of pounds from traffickers during fake stops. Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday Judge David Tomlinson said Mahmood abused his position of power, trust and responsibility. Mahmood remained impassive as he was led to the cells in blue shirt and black facemask. Judge Tomlinson said he would have known he was putting iniduals in danger by leaving those he stole from vulnerable to reprisals from their underworld bosses.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. Addressing the former PC and his co-defendants, the judge said: “aposIt must have been plain to all of you that these couriers were being put in harmaposs way.” Mahmood was allegedly tipped off about who to target by the Dubai based mastermind of the organised crime group who was using an encrypted EncroChat phone. Mujtaba Neazmand, an Afghani national, left the UK in  after being made the subject of a proceeds of crime order and is believed to be there now.  Detectives would not be drawn on whether he is wanted in the UK. Hundreds of top and middle level organised crime figures have been arrested after the EncroChat phone network was hacked by European law enforcement last year. The court heard how Mahmood had become the first in his family to go to university, after avoiding the pull of criminal gangs while growing up in east London.  He had been stabbed as a teenager for refusing to get involved in crime, his barrister Bill Emlyn Jones said. But after ten years as a successful officer with five commendations his “background caught up with him”, the court heard. Mr Emlyn Jones said: “He thought he had escaped it, but it pulled him back in.”  Mahmood jetted off to Dubai where he was pictured with his co-defendants and splashed out on a £, Rolex watch. The court heard he was a longtime associate of gangster twins Shabaz Khan, , and Shazad Khan, , and their brother Moshin Khan, . He misused police computers to check what intelligence was held about the brothers and Neazmand.

He was kicked out of the Met last year after a disciplinary  found he had driven a police car while his associate posed as a police officer to seize cash which was due to be laundered or was payment for drugs. Mohsin Khan was sentenced to  years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and conspiracy to acquire criminal property.  Shabaz Khan was jailed for  years for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property, conspiracy to acquire criminal property and possession of a controlled drug of class B with intent to supply. Shazad Khan was sentenced to  years and five years and four months in jail respectively for conspiracy to supply class A drugs, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Ioan Gherghel, who dressed as an officer while accompanying his friend Mahmood on the raids, was jailed six years for conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Moshin Khanaposs ex-partner Maria Shah, , admitted supplying class A drugs and conspiracy to acquire criminal property and was sentenced to five years and four months. Scotland Yardaposs Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid, Directorate of Professionalism, said: “Mahmood may have been a police constable in name, but he was nothing more than a criminal who abused his position to look after the interests of organised crime.” Steve Noonan, of the Independent Office of Police Conduct, said: “This officer’s behaviour was audacious, corrupt and criminal. His actions were a complete betrayal of public trust and confidence and have no place in policing.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMohsin KhanScotland YardCourt caseCrown courtPolice carCrimeTeenagersTwinsKne crime"},{"url":null,"title":"gp surgeries must offer face","story":"NewsAll GP surgeries must offer face-to-face appointments from Monday with receptions openA letter sent out to GPs on Thursday has said the use of telephone and online consultations can remain where patients benefit from them, but physical appointments must also be available from May mirrorShareCommentsByTess de la MareJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY NewsCurrently around half of consultations in general practice are being delivered face to face \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The process - which saw patients remotely screened - was put in place during the pandemic to minimise the spread of infection. There had been talk of the system being adopted even after le ed to normal - a move criticised by some medical groups. A letter sent out to GPs on Thursday has now said the use of telephone and online consultations can remain where patients benefit from them, but physical appointments must also be available from May . All practice reception desks must also be open to patients in a Covid-safe manner so those who do not have easy access to phones or the internet are not disadvantaged when accessing care, it added. Do you have a view on this story  Email webnews@mirror.  Currently around half of consultations in general practice are being delivered face to face. Before the pandemic, some  per cent of appointments were face-to-face and  per cent were phone, video or online, but this switched to around  per cent face-to-face and  per cent remote at the height of the crisis. Total triage, introduced in March , saw patients being remotely screened and directed to the most appropriate health service for their problems. GP appointments were also conducted by telephone, video or online unless it was clinically necessary for a consultation to take place in person. In the joint letter from Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director for primary care at NHS England and director of primary care Ed Waller, doctors were told patientsapos preferences must be respected. Patients and clinicians have a choice of consultation mode, they said. They added: Patientsapos input into this choice should be sought and practices should respect preferences for face-to-face care unless there are good clinical reasons to the contrary.

Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.Dr Kanani and Mr Waller cited the presence of Covid- symptoms as an example of a reason to refuse a face-to-face appointment.Patients should be treated consistently regardless of mode of access, they said.Ideally, a patient attending the practice reception should be triaged on the same basis as they would be via phone or via an online consultation system. Dr Kanani and Mr Waller added that to ensure receptions can open safely, patients might be asked to queue outside. The letter to GPs comes just two days after a report by the Royal College of General Practitionersheavily criticised plans to embed total triage into general practice post-pandemic. The report noted that complex conditions or those of a sensitive nature where a GP might need to pick up on non-verbal queues such as signs of anxiety or indicators of substance abuse can be easily missed remotely. Professor Martin Marshall, chairman of the RCGP, welcomed the news that the option of in-person services should be available to everyone. He said: This is good news and is what patients and GPs want to see. It removes ambiguity and we are particularly pleased that our calls for shared decision-making between GP and patient on the most appropriate method of consultation have been heard. We now have a flexible approach decided upon by clinicians and their patients.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds travellers descend tiny cotswold","story":"NewsHundreds of travellers descend on tiny Cotswold town for -year-old horse festivalThe Stow Horse Fair has ed to Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire today after being cancelled twice last year due to the pandemic, with travellers from across the country attending the eventmirrorShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY NewsThe biannual Stow Horse Fair has ed to Stow-on-the-Wold for the first time in over a year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Based on the information provided by the organisers and extremely low infection rates there is insufficient evidence to warrant action under the regulations. “Officers from Cotswold District Council and the Police, supported by Covid support officers, will be on site throughout the event to monitor compliance. Testing will also be available in the area.” The Fair dates back almost five hundred years and originally began as a sheep fair for the Cotswold wool trade.

The baby fox soon started to grow and now eats a diet of meat and dog biscuits.  “He is adorable,” Belinda said. “But he has always had an attitude. “Once I lost him for seven hours and he had crawled behind a bathroom .  “When I found him he came straight for a cuddle.” He is now lapping up milk and eating for himself and gets on well with Belinda’s rescue poodle, Arthur. “They snuggle up next to each other all the time,” she said.

It is certainly possible the Indian iant could overtake the Kent iant and become the countryaposs dominant strain, expert Dr Duncan Robertson told the Mirror.By region in England, London had the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases of the mutant iant -  as of Wednesday, accounting for almost a third of total Covid cases in the capital.The North West was not far behind, with its total of  infections making up a quarter of all confirmed and probable cases of coronavirus in the region, which includes Greater Manchester. Have you tested positive for the Indian coronavirus iant  Email your story to webnews@mirror.  Given the rapid spread of the iant, the Government is facing calls to consider postponing the easing of most Covid restrictions in England in June.Local lockdowns  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out local lockdowns being necessary to contain the spread of the virus. Surge testing has been launched in  areas, including Bolton, Formby and parts of London, while increased genomic sequencing and enhanced contact tracing are among other measures being used to prevent the spread of the iant, the Government said. The Government is also considering bringing forward the date for a second dose of vaccine for eligible groups to increase protection.  Data from Public Health Englandshows a rise in cases of the Indian iant from  to , this week in the UK, with the agency saying cases were “rising in the community” and it was assessing the impact and severity of the iant. Three types of the B.. iant, first detected in India, are circulating within the UK, and it is B... that is spreading fast and causing concern. London and the North West have reported the highest number of cases of that strain, which the World Health Organisation has classied as a iant of global concern. In London, the proportion of confirmed and probable cases caused by the B... iant has surged to just under  per cent, while it is . per cent in the North West.  About a quarter of the  total cases in London were people who had travelled. In the North West, where there is widespread community transmission, the proportion of travellers among the  cases was much lower . The number of cases linked to people who had travelled to the UK from India soared in April, figures show. Here is a regional breakdown of the PHE data :London - North West - East - East Midlands - South East - West Midlands - South West - Yorkshire and Humber - North East -  In Bolton, which has one of the highest case rates of the iant in the country, mobile testing units have been deployed and door-to-door PCR Covid testing has been offered to , residents.

Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. A vaccine bus has been set up to increase uptake among those who are eligible and a rapid response team of  nurses, public health advisers and environmental health officers has been sent in Surge testing has been deployed in Sefton, Merseyside, after cases of the Indian iant were confirmed in the Formby area, with anyone over  who lives, works or studies in the area urged to take a PCR test. Measures have also been brought in where, including in parts of London. In a tweet, Professor Christina Pagel, a mathematician and professor of operational research at University College London, said the iant might already be dominant in London and the North West, based on the PHE figures and using S gene detection as a proxy.  Professor Pagel, a member of Independent Sage, added: I thinkwe just know too little about B... except that itaposs spreading rapidly and the risks are quite high. Dr Robertson, a coronavirus modeller at Loughborough University, told the Mirror that experts cannot be certain where the iant is becoming dominant as it takes time for conclusive sequencing of samples. He added: B... cases appear to be rising in North West England and London and cases have been detected in Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, and Sefton. Some of these cases can be traced back to travellers, but many appear to be due to transmission within the community.  On Thursday, Professor James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, warned the Indian iant should be viewed as a country-wide problem, telling BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.” It is too soon to predict whether the Indian iant could overtake the Kent strain and become the dominant iant across the whole of the nation. Dr Robertson said: We saw that the Kent iant - B... - became dominant in the new year, and we are seeing signs that some areas are now having cases dominated by B.... It’s finely balanced. The so-called secondary attack rate is very similar between B...and B... .  Basically, we need more time and more data to be more certain. But the high numbers of cases and the high levels of transmissibility mean that it is certainly possible for B... to become dominant – although there may be other iants that emerge that also compete. Dr Robertson said PHE is doing an excellent job collecting and analysing data, and surge testing is helping to gather better data. The Government on Friday said Boris Johnsonaposs June  lockdown roadmap easing – when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted – was still on track despite the latest figures. Dr Robertson said the Government must be cautious as any risk-taking could increase the likelihood of tougher lockdowns at a national or local level down the road. He added: With all unlocking decisions, it is a balance of risk and reward – the rewards of being able to meet people indoors more easily but the risk of that causing increased transmission and case rates increasing. “We are in a dferent position to late last year. Much of the population is now vaccinated but by no means all. The virus will find the most vulnerable and will causes cases to be found. The question is how many of these cases go on to be hospitalised and die. It is a real risk, and one that only the Government can take. But taking that risk does mean that the potential for reintroduction of more stringent lockdown measures, either at a local or a national level, increases. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the Government was “anxious” about the iant and “there is a range of things we could doas he refused to rule out the possibility of local lockdowns. Despite the spread of the Indian iant, Mr Johnson said there was “nothing that dissuades me” from easing England’s lockdown on Monday or the further steps towards normality on June . But he added “there may be things we have to do locally and we will not hesitate to do themthat is the advice we get”.

As experts say vaccines have saved , lives, a surge in cases in Bolton threatens to scupper progress. Scientists and government figures are holding urgent talks amid fears it could delay the end of lockdown rules. Boris Johnson today said he was anxious about the B.. strain, which almost tripled in a week to  UK cases as of May .But there is good news and bad news - and itaposs important to be aware of the facts. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  But how did we get here - and why are authorities so worried  Here are all your key questions answered. . Why are we concerned about the Indian iant  Public Health England believes the iant spreads at least as well as the Kent iant still dominant in the UK. Analysis is ongoing butit turns out to have higher transmissibility then that would give it competitive advantage and it could start to take over. . How has this happened   The original India iant - officially known as B.. - was first detected in October and cases have been imported from abroad. It is now known to be spreading in clusters in some communities. . Is there more than one Indian iant  It has been re-characterised as three dferent subtypes, all with slightly dferent genetic mutations. The UK has seen a sharp increase in one subtype known as B... which now makes up the majority of our cases and appears to be growing faster than others. . Why does it spread easier than previous iants   It contains two key mutations to the outer “spike” protein of the virus that attaches to human cells. Some experts believe it may be overpowering prior immunity from natural infections in some people who had caught earlier iants. . But the good news is... There is no indication yet that it evades the protection offered by current vaccines. This means evenit becomes more prevalent across the UK it should not make most people seriously ill. Widespread vaccinations and natural immunity mean it should not trigger death spikes seen during earlier waves and put hospitals under pressure again. . Why does it put the June  reopening at risk   Increasing Covid- rates with any iant would still kill some unvaccinated people - take-up is lower in ethnic minority communities - or those for whom immune protection has waned. Higher viral prevalence also increases the chances that the virus will mutate again to stop vaccines working as well. . What can the UK do about it  Make use of our world leading genetic sequencing to detect clusters and deploy surge testing. The fact that we are hearing about this increase actually shows the system at work. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email.

But for locals enjoying the sunshine in front of the huge Covid information sign in the town hall square, testing simply isn’t going far enough to tackle the new surge in cases making Bolton one of the country’s virus hotspots. Residents here want the whole town vaccinated - and fast - to prevent another local lockdown like they had last year when most of the rest of the country saw restrictions begin to lt. The infection rate in the town was the second highest in the UK at . cases per , people last week and cases of the Indian iant have risen dramatically in the area. This and the fact infections are also increasing in the under s in the town has led to both Greater Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham and Bolton North East MP Mark Logan to call for vaccinations for all over s. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Shopkeeper Mohsin Nazir, , saw his business shut during lockdown and urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “I’ve just heard about this new iant that has come from India or somewhere. I think they need to be vaccinating everyone now. I’ve had my vaccine. We just want to get back to some sort of normal le, no more lockdowns, everyone working again.” Carol and Peter Marsden have both been vaccinated but are still very worried about the surge in cases in Bolton.  Retired cook Carol, , says: “They definitely need to start vaccinating the younger people. It is the younger people we see not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing. If people refuse the vaccine they should have to stay at home.” The sudden rise in infections in Bolton is believed to be driven by the B... strain of the virus, often called the Indian iant. It is thought to have been brought into the town by people travelling back and forth from India and Pakistan. There is also a spike in London while an outbreak is Glasgow is also thought to be linked to the iant. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.Just days before the next lting of lockdown in England is due to take place on Monday, PM Boris Johnson admitted on Thursday he was “anxious” about the new strain.Speaking at a primary school in Ferryhill, Co Durham, the Prime Minister said: “It is a iant of concern, we are anxious about it. At the moment there is a very wide range of scientic opinion about what could happen. “We want to make sure we take all the prudential, cautious steps now that we could take, so there are meetings going on today to consider exactly what we need to do. “There is a range of things we could do, we are ruling nothing out.”  Askedlocal lockdowns were possible, Mr Johnson insisted: “We want to make sure we grip it.” He added: “Obviously there’s surge testing, there’s surge tracing. If we have to do other things, then of course the public would want us to rule nothing out.” But he was confident a spike would not derail Monday’s latest planned unlocking, with Step Three of the Government’s “roadmap” due to be triggered – allowing households to mix indoors, and pubs, restaurants and cafes to serve customers inside.Government scientists were expected to meet on Thursday to discuss the rising coronavirus threat from the Indian iant in Britain. Some members of Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesare believed to be pushing for a delay to the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown set for June . Leading expert Prof James Naismith, of Oxford University, said the iant may spread “way beyond” the local areas where it has been detected. “I think we should view it as a country-wide problem,” he said. “It will get everywhere. We keep learning this lesson, but we know that this will be the case.”  Prof Naismith said he did not believe local restrictions would work to contain the iant, adding: “When we tried locally having dferent restrictions in dferent regions that didn’t really make any dference. “So I don’t think thinking about a localised strategy for containment will really work.” The prospect of a potential future local lockdown is the last thing the people of Bolton want resident Carol adds. “I will be annoyedthey lock us older ones down again when we have stuck by the rules.” Her husband Peter agrees. The retired sheet metal worker, , said: “I heard that people travelled from India. But surely they should have been isolating I don’t understand why international travel hasn’t been banned - this new iant has to have come from somewhere.  “Also I think public transport is a problem in Bolton. When you get on the bus there are a lot of people not wearing masks. The drivers don’t seem to be enforcing it. The older people do, but the younger ones aren’t.” Fishmonger Lee Morris, , who works on Bolton Market, added: “I’m very worried about it - rates in Bolton are now among the highest in the country.I’ve had the vaccine and I feel more confident now that I’ve had it because I work with the public every day. “I think rates in Bolton are high because young people aren’t sticking to the rules - socialising, parties. I do think they should offer younger people the vaccine but that only worksthey take it.I think people are dodging it because they are scared of it. “If they lock us down again I will be devastated. It will have a massive impact on the market.” Students Reia Raichura and Jamiee Patel disagreed that young people were to blame for the spread of the virus - but also had quite dfering views on what to do to stop it.  Jaimee, , had Covid herself last November and lost her grandma to the virus. She has had both vaccines and believes that all young people should be offered it. She said: “I was quite ill and my grandma passed away. I had to isolate for four weeks to see her in her last days. I think everyone should be offered the vaccine now as well as antibody tests.” Her friend Reia Raichura though is still worried about the vaccine - even though cases are rising at their sixth form college. Reia, , said: “We have been sticking to the rules. But I feel it is getting out of hand now. I think they need to think about closing the schools and colleges as well. There have been people testing positive and having to isolate at our sixth form. “I’m still not sure about the vaccine though.” Yesterday the Office for National Statistics announced that seven in ten people in England now test positive for Covid- antibodies, suggesting either vaccination or prior infection. The number was closer to six in ten for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The European Medicines Agency said on Wednesday that it was “pretty confident” that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant. Prof Steven Riley, of Imperial College London, who runs the UK’s biggest Covid- surveillance study, said there was no indication that the iant was increasing hospitalisations. He said: “I think there’s two key things that have got to be kind of evaluated -infections go up, how quickly will they go up  But then after that, are they linked to the hospitalisations  “The top-line Government policy is driven by protecting the NHS, so eveninfection starts to go up, we then need to assess whether that’s bringing a lot of new cases into hospitals, and there’s certainly no sign of that at the moment.” The B... iant is now claiming around , lives a day in India where vaccination rates are much lower.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPoliticsCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"inside stunning country pub being","story":"NewsInside the stunning country pub being raffled off - and it could be yours for a tennerPub owners William and Judith Brown are raffling off their country pub, which comes with four-bedroom accommodation and all the stockmirrorShareCommentsByEmma Grimshaw:,  MAY NewsJudith and William Brown have run the pub for more than six years - and are ready to pass it on \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Cambridge University researchers say that maggots, mealworms, flies, seaweed and algae are among “future foods” that must be “mass-farmed” to combat malnutrition. The researchers claim that reservations about eating new foods such as insects could be overcome by using them as ingredients rather than eating them whole. They say current menu staples such as burgers, pasta and energy bars can all contain ground insect larvae and processed micro- and macro- algae. Their new report calls for “radical changes” to safeguard our food supply and combat malnutrition in the face of climate change, environmental degradation and epidemics.Would you have maggots for dinner  Join the debate in our comments They claim our future global food supply can’t be safeguarded by traditional approaches to improving food production. Instead, they suggest state-of-the-art, controlled-environment systems, producing new foods, should be integrated into the current system to reduce vulnerability to environmental changes, pests and diseases. The Cambridge research team, whose findings were published in the journal Nature Food, say that global malnutrition could be ‘eradicated’ by farming foods including larvae of insects such as the house fly, mycoprotein - protein derived from fungi, and macro-algae such as sugar kelp. They say such foods have already attracted interest as “nutritious” and “more sustainable” alternatives to traditional plant and animal-based foods. The ‘future foods’ can be easily grown on an industrial scale suitable for urban settings as well as isolated communities such as those on remote islands, according to the report.  In an approach the researchers call ‘polycentric food networks’, nutritional dishes could be produced locally and consistently by communities - reducing reliance on global supply chains. The Cambridge team analysed around  published scientic papers on dferent future food production systems. The most promising, including microalgae photo-bioreactors - devices that use a light source to grow microorganisms - and insect breeding greenhouses, reduce exposure to the hazards of the natural environment by farming in controlled environments. Study first author Dr Asaf Tzachor, a researcher at the Centre for the Study of Existential Riskat Cambridge University, said: “Foods like sugar kelp, flies, mealworm and single-celled algae such as chlorella, have the potential to provide healthy, risk-resilient diets that can address malnutrition around the world.  “Our current food system is vulnerable. It’s exposed to a litany of risks - floods and frosts, droughts and dry spells, pathogens and parasites - which marginal improvements in productivity won’t change. “To future-proof our food supply we need to integrate completely new ways of farming into the current system.” The report argues it is dangerous to rely on food produced through conventional farming and supply systems, which are at risk of serious disruption from several factors beyond human control. The researchers say that the Covid pandemic highlighted the vulnerability with Government-imposed restrictions on travel disrupting food production and supply chains across the world. Recent environmental challenges to food systems include wildfires and droughts in North America, outbreaks of African swine fever affecting pigs in Asia and Europe, and swarms of desert locust in East Africa.

Catherine Richards, a doctoral researcher at CSER, said: “Advances in technology open up many possibilities for alternative food supply systems that are more risk-resilient, and can efficiently supply sustainable nutrition to billions of people.”She added: “The coronavirus pandemic is just one example of increasing threats to our globalised food system.“Diversying our diet with these future foods will be important in achieving food security for all.” The report states that two billion people currently experience food insecurity, including more than  million people undernourished and  million children suffering micro-nutrient deficiencies.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUniversity of CambridgeEducationClimate changeFishingFloods"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Met Office has said that miserable May is not likely to get any better in the coming days with heavy rain and thunderstorms set to batter the country.While Friday will see downpours staying largely along the coast, as the weekend gets under way most parts of the UK will see torrential downpours. Forecaster Alex Deakin said: The weather continues a messy pattern across the UK with most places looking fairly cloudy for much of Friday.  But a few spots will see some sunshine. There will again be some heavy showers developing but not as many as recent days and for quite a few Friday should be a dry day. He added: There is more wet weather in the offing towards towards the weekend. On Friday temperatures will begin in single digits for much of the day and there will be sporadic showers, mostly hitting coastal regions all across the south and west of the country. Highs will reach  C in the south towards the end of the day.  But by the weekend forecasters have warned of torrential weather for many parts of the UK, with only Scotland spared the full force of the downpour. Forecasters at the Met Office warned Brits to expect aposa lot of showersapos which will be aposheavy and thundery.apos Temperatures are also expected to be below average and just barely rising into double digits across the UK. It comes after forecasters warned that the unsettled weather, which has marred much of spring, will drag on for at least the next  days, and possibly even beyond then. Heavy showers and more thunderstorms are likely to be a fixture for a few weeks with the mercury reaching no higher than C, the Met Office said.  Forecaster Marco Petagna earlier told the Mirror: The longer range forecast suggests that by early June thereaposs a hint of things becoming drier and more settled. Before that, temperatures could reach close to or above the average. Most likely it will be the mid to high teens -  or C. It looks unsettled for the next week or so. The next  days are quite mixed. That means showers and longer spells of rain. Today A cloudy start for all with some sunny spells developing by day. Staying dry for most in the north and east but across southern England, Wales and particularly Northern Ireland some showers breaking out by day. Tonight Rain arriving from the southwest with some heavy bursts and moving northeast overnight. Much of Scotland and northern England staying dry. Cool in the far north. Saturday Cloudy with rain across much of the UK to start. This breaking down to showers again by day, heaviest in the south and west. Northern Scotland faring best. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday Remaining changeable with sunny spells and scattered showers which will be locally heavy with a risk of hail and thunder, particularly in the south. Remaining rather cool.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet OfficeWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"wales pauses relaxing covid rules","story":"NewsWales pauses relaxing Covid rules next week due to fears over Indian iantFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision had to be taken because of fears that the Indian iant could spread further after  cases in Wales were confirmedmirrorShareCommentsByNilufer Atik:,  MAY NewsWales will not ease all of its restrictions and is being more cautious \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The rule stating that those meeting up in public must stay two-metres apart will still have to be adhered to, despite no longer applying in Scotland and England. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the decision was taken because of concerns over the Indian iant of the virus. There have been  cases of the iant in Wales so far, with a concentration in the north-west of England causing concern due to its proximity and link with the Welsh north-east. Wales will move to alert level two on Monday with the reopening of indoor hospitality and entertainment venues, but Mr Drakeford said his Government would pause further easementsthe risks in doing so would be too great.  He told BBC Radio  Live: Within your own household bubble or extended household youaposll be able to make decisions about who you hug and who you cwtch. But weaposre not yet thinking, largely because of the Indian iant, weaposre not going to change the rules about people more generally. We expect the two-metre social distance to be sustained. Wales will move to alert level two on Monday with the reopening of indoor hospitality and entertainment venues, but Mr Drakeford said his Government would pause further easementsthe risks in doing so would be too great. We can change the rules, we donapost have to wait two or three weeks. If we get advice that says itaposs safe to move ahead on that, weaposll do so as soon as we get that advice.  But we are just pausing to make sure that we have the best possible evidence about the newly emerging risks that there may be because ofIndian iant. Since the start of the pandemic, the government in England has insisted close contact with other people is one of the easiest ways to spread Covid- and has advised against it. From Monday however, this advice will end and people will be allowed to hug their grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, friends and anyone  who is close to them again. They will have the choice whether to socially distancethey want to. People in England and Scotland will also be allowed to go to the pub or restaurant with up to six people or two households, sit indoors and enjoy a meal and some drinks. All indoor entertainment venues including cinemas, museums and childrenaposs play areas will also be allowed to reopen. But Wales has held back relaxing restrictions on allowing small events and meeting people for fears it could prompt the Indian iant of Covid to spread.  On Friday, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: We were considering a small number of further easements from Monday but have decided to hold back on those until we get the advice from Sagewho met yesterday, our own scientic advice which weaposll receive imminently, just to make sure that we are continuing to take a precautionary approach in case the Indian iant is on the march, and therefore Wales would be vulnerable to it as well. Askedhe would be prepared to delay further steps in his road mapadvice from Sage suggests it is necessary, Mr Drakeford said: Yes, we would. We tried our best to follow the scientic advice at every step andthe advice were to be that we should hold back on some further easements because the risks in doing so would be too great then certainly that is what we would do.

Mr Drakeford told Sky News ministers had thought about moving ahead with the reopening of smaller events as well as liberalising the rules in the way in which people can meet together, not just in their extended household but beyond that, with both now on hold. If the advice on the Indian iant is that it is safe to move ahead, we wonapost need to wait for the end of our next three-week cycle to do those things, but the Indian iant is giving us cause for concern, he said. We donapost know enough about whether it is more transmissible than the Kent iant, we donapost know enough about whether the vaccination programme is as effective in dealing with it as it is with other iants we have in Wales, and until weaposre a bit clearer on that I think it is sensible to take a precautionary approach.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBBC Radio  LiveRadio R TodayFoodCoronavirusIndia"},{"url":null,"title":"woman left note 22 year","story":"NewsWoman left note on -year-olds grave reading ‘hahaha, looks like diabetes won’Simona Julius daubed the vile message on the headstone of -year-old Liam Scarman, who died of diabetes on Boxing Day in  - leaving the deceased mans relatives devastatedmirrorShareCommentsByOllie Buckley:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSimona Julius was jailed for the vandalism \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Looks like diabetes won again. Simona Julius, , daubed paint on the headstone of Liam Scarman - leaving his family devastated. Liam died of diabetes aged  on Boxing Day in  after a suffering a diabetic hypo. Julius wrote the words P*ssyhole bruv on the grave in paint and also left a note saying: Ha Ha Ha Liam. Looks like diabetes won again. It is unclear why she did it - but his family previously said they suspected the culprit was associated with a former love rival. She carried out the attack overnight between November  and  last year.  She was jailed for eight weeks at Bristol Magistrates Court on Wednesday over the damage to the headstone at Westerleigh Crematorium in Bristol. She had admitted criminal damage and two counts of malicious communications at an earlier hearing. She was also ordered to pay £ compensation to the family and handed a three-year restraining order. District Judge Lynne Matthews described Juliusapos actions as perplexing and wicked and struck at the very heart of the family. The crimes, just before the three-year anniversary of Liamaposs death in December , caused his family great distress. In a personal statement to the court, Liamaposs mother Sue Witt described how Juliusapos actions took over family membersapos lives.  She said: Losing a child is the worst possible grief you could imagine. It has consumed my le. Having found out that somebody had damaged Liamaposs grave just compounded all those emotions and undid the progress I had made in dealing with his death. aposI think people are wondering what kind of person Liam was, how horrible a person he must have been for somebody to damage his grave the way they did, when in reality everybody who knew him loved him. I never knew him to do anything nasty or horrible to anybody. I donapost understand why she did it. Some of the notes were addressed to Liamaposs father, plumber and heating engineer Trevor Scarman, , who said in his statement: When I found out Liamaposs headstone had been vandalised, I had a numb feeling that went through my body. My initial reaction was why   Why had someone damaged it  Why just Liamaposs was targeted  How anyone can write such disgusting things about my son I just cannot believe. The physical damage has been repaired but the emotional damage will take far longer to repair. Itaposs like someone is sticking a kne in and twisting it. Our family are completely distraught. To commit an act of criminal damage like this along with vile notes addressed to me has left me feeling devastated. Investigating officer PC Kyle Maywood of the said: Iaposm glad that we were able to identy the culprit and bring some relief to the family, but Julius has never answered the question of what motivated her to act as she did and cause such distress.

I hope the sentence will help Liamaposs family to put this behind them so they are able to remember him as their much-loved son and brother and not Juliusapos hateful actions. I also hope the case gives other victims of disability hate crime the confidence to report incidents to us. PC Maywood added: I would like to thank the members of the public who provided crucial information after seeing the appeals for information and calling in. Liam, who worked in insurance sales, died at his dadaposs house in Winterbourne Down., Glos, while living with his brother Oliver and girlfriend.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMcDonalds CorporationBoxing DayCourt caseCriminal damageCrimeCocaineDiabetesHate crime"},{"url":null,"title":"dads disappointment over having girl","story":"NewsDads disappointment over having a girl in gender reveal sparks debateA dad who shared a video of the moment the gender of his new baby was revealed was called out for his \"disappointed\" reaction - but others saw the funny side of itmirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video dads-disappointment-over-gender-reveal-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IzVTtRgj,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice A group of leading scientists has said the possibility that coronavirus accidentally escaped from the Wuhan lab in China remains viable. In a letter published in the journal Science,  researchers from Stanford, Hard, MIT and Cambridge blasted the World Health Organizationand scientists who followed it for failing to consider that there may have may been an accidental lab escape of the virus.The Wuhan Institute of Virology is where the case of coronavirus was first detected in December . But a WHO task force spent four weeks investigating the outbreak in Wuhan in January and February and concluded it was extremely unlikely that it was caused by a lab leak.  It instead found there was more chance the outbreak occurred due to “zoonotic spillover” from bats to humans through another animals. Covid-, which emerged in China in late , has killed . million people, cost the world trillions of dollars in lost income and upended normal le for billions of people. The latest letter said the WHO investigation didnapost make a balanced consideration of the theory that it may have come from the Wuhan lab and called for a proper investigation into the matter.  We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data, the letter reads. In this time of unfortunate anti-Asian sentiment in some countries, we note that at the beginning of the pandemic, it was Chinese doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizens who shared with the world crucial information about the spread of the virus—often at great personal cost. David Relman, the Stanford microbiologist who organised the letter, said: We know that laboratory accidents happen far more often than anyone would like to admit.” “And that includes the very best labs, including those here in the United States.” He goes on saying: Theories of accidental release from a lab and zoonotic spillover both remain viable. The WHO task force investigating the origin of the virus said in March that it was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal. It was further reported that the facilities had high-quality biosafety levels, and there had been no reports of similar illnesses among staff during the months before the pandemic hit. Employees had also not tested positive for Covid in subsequent blood screening for antibodies, the report said. In view of the above, a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely, it said.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMassachusetts Institute of Technology Hard UniversityWorld Health OrganizationCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"israel drag gaza to depths","story":"NewsIsrael will drag Gaza to depths of hell with plan for ground war against militantsAs the Palestinian death toll passed , with  children, Christian Aid warned they will take us into the depths of hellIsrael conducts a threatened ground warmirrorShareCommentsByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsA ball of fire engulfing the Al-Walid building which was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza city early in the morning \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A ground offensive plan will be presented to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu today as the Palestinian death toll passed , with  children, this week. The number of injured Palestinians is approaching , including  children. Despite campaign groups calling for a ceasefire, there is little sign of either side halting the cross-border barrage. Tonight the charity Christian Aid said: “Even without a threatened ground invasion these figures will go up with one, they will take us into the depths of hell. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The international community cannot afford to continue failing in their responsibility to use every possible measure to stop the violence.” Yesterday sirens blared in southern Israel as a barrage of  rockets screamed out of Gaza almost simultaneously. Israeli sources said the government was determined to avoid a ground war, mindful of the  Gaza War that killed more than , Palestinians and  Israelis.  One source said: “Plans are being drawn up for a ground offensive, even though the Israeli Defence Force has inflicted serious damage on the Hamas military leadership. There is only so much Israeli intelligence can do in terms of picking out Hamas buildings to hit. “A ground offensive... unthinkable just days ago, remains nevertheless on the table.”  Israel declined a ceasefire offer from Hamas yesterday, “back-channelled” via Russia. It came despite the group launching , rockets at Israel since Monday, killing six civilians and a soldier. Among those killed by Israel are nine senior Hamas leaders.  Many of the Palestinian group’s bases are ruined. As Israeli troops gathered at the Gaza border on Thursday, one Israeli minister said after a meeting with Mr Netanyahu: “The campaign is still far from over.

He also shared the secret with four friends who collectively took a combined total of £, worth of food before they were caught.Ordering a takeaway via KFC’s phone app, Xu was using a voucher in April  when he discovered the glitch.Xu was jailed for two and a half years and fined £ while his friends were jailed for a period between  months and two years.  Between April and October that year, he effectively managed to generate endless free food vouchers by switching between the KFC app and the company’s store on WeChat, China’s equivalent of WhatsApp. Using this method, he found he could place an order using the voucher but it would also still remain in his account. Xu was using the hack to make money by selling on meals to friends. Xu then sold on some of the meals for a cut-price to his classmates while also eating them himself. His friends, who exploited the glitch in a similar fashion got away with free food worth between £, and £, each. The group was eventually caught and they admitted committing fraud.

to Dens Park on Saturday.Dundee#s biggest name player, Adam, turned up on the big night, with two trademark through balls cutting the home defence wide open.His precision, combined with the timing of McGhee’s running and cool finishing, saw the Dark Blues take a two-goal lead.More than setting up the goals, though, Adam was a leader in the middle of the park.Not only by talking his team-mates through the contest and taking charge when needed but by dishing out the verbals to the opposition players when the chance came too.Dundee’s captain hasn’t had the best few months, being out of the team for ious reasons.However, with promotion chances on the line, he’s the man for Dundee in the big moments.It’s only one game in a potential four but so far he’s delivering for his team.And boy did he deliver for the barnstorming runs of McGhee.Moving the defender into an all-action midfield role has worked an absolute treat for James McPake.In fact, Dundee have never lost a football match with McGhee in that role.A remarkable stat # but maybe not so remarkable when he puts in performances like Wednesday.He most certainly didn’t finish his chances like a defender.The first was anything but easy # but McGhee made it look simple.And when the goal was gaping in front of him in the second half, there was no fluffing of the lines.Along with Shaun Byrne anchoring the midfield, that’s where Dundee won this first leg.James McPake went for the ‘-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it’ approach to his tactics on the night.The last time the teams met, the Dark Blues came out on top.The Kirkcaldy side were far better this time around in possession early on but as the Dark Blues grew into the game, Raith shrank.Then Dundee’s quality told.Raith got most joy in the opening period down the flanks.Dan Armstrong certainly caused problems for left-back Cammy Kerr early onAfter fearing he’d be out for the season, the hope was first choice Jordan Marshall wouldin time for the play-off push.However, he managed just two training sessions prior to Wednesday night’s contest and was only fit enough to take a place on the bench.Kerr has been a more than able stand-in recently but he was up against something dferent this time around – for  minutes anyway.The first nutmeg was too heavy for Armstrong to catch but the winger pulled another off before the half-time whistle.Christie Elliott, an attacker throughout much of his career, can be caught out defensively too.Raith got a bit of joy in those areas in the first half but Dundee shut that door after the break.Their quality further up the pitch saw the Dark Blues take control of the scoreline.With it, the pressure was taken off the backline, with both Kerr and Christie subsequently playing a huge role in earning their clean sheet.Dundee most certainly have the tie in their hands ahead of the second leg at Dens Park on Saturday night.Raith, though, have shown all season they are too good a side to just go away.The first leg is in the bag for James McPake and his team – however, there can be no complacency despite their three-goal lead.There is still work to be done.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox

#Hilarity Report#, showed that Dundonians laugh  times a day # six times more than the national average.Younger Dundonians have an even higher chance of cracking up on a daily basis, with statistics showing that children often laugh more than  times in  hours.Comedian Andy Bullick, who was born in Northern Ireland but performs in Dundee, claims that the city#s easy attitude may add to locals# sense of humour.He said: #What I#ve heard from other comedians who have performed here at shows we#ve done is that they love to come and perform in Dundee.#It seems like, as a comedian, you can get away with a bit more in Dundee, maybe use some jokes that might not go over as well in Edinburgh or Glasgow.#It#s a good attitude from the crowd.#I think that you also have to think a bit more when you tell jokes here.#It#s easy to make jokes about posh people from Edinburgh or do a Glaswegian accent, but here you have to try a bit harder.#The comedian has also had his fair share of comical moments in the city, saying: #There was once a time here when I asked a woman in the crowd when she was due.#It turns out that she wasn#t pregnant at all!#It was only the goodness of the crowd in Dundee that allowed me to turn that around and let everyone see the funny side.#The report named Sunderland as the UK#s funniest city, followed by Wrexham, Bath and, of course, Dundee.The only other Scottish city to earn a spot in the top ten was Aberdeen, coming in at seventh.Actors were found to be the funniest profession, followed by cabbies.Gregor Ross, a taxi driver from Dundee, said: #Well, some taxi drivers do have a good sense of humour.#I think that it#s because you#ll get all sorts of people in your car and you get used to talking to them and that.#Also, you get a lot of drunks who can be quite humorous and laugh easily, so that might help.#When you meet a lot of people you can come away with something quite funny to tell people about.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your

Premiership play-off semi-final with a - win at Raith Rovers.A Jordan McGhee double either side of the break and an Osman Sow strike six minutes from time left Rovers with a mountain to climb going into Saturday#s second leg at Dens Park.Instead, it is the Dark Blues who can dream of a top-flightafter a dominant display.There was a lack of energy about Raith in the opening exchanges as the home side lacked the zip in their play that saw them ease past Dunfermline in their Fe derby quarter-final.Their early play was littered with misplaced passes and they were lucky not to go behind in the first minute.Iain Davidson was slack with a ball to Kyle Benedictus and they were fortunate when Paul McMullan screwed his shot wide.Dundee, fresh from the break they earned by finishing above their hosts in second in the Championship table, were content to allow Rovers possession before pressing hard when they could.But they were forced into more desperate defending in the sixth minute.Brad Spencer found room for a shot that Charlie Adam threw himself in front of to block.Cammy Kerr then repelled a Dan Armstrong effort as Rovers recycled possession.Adam then set up the opener with a piece of vintage skill in the nd minute. A magnicent diagonal pass picked out the run of McGhee and the midfielder side-footed his volley beyond the exposed Jamie MacDonald.Raith slowly recovered and built up a head of stead as the half-time whistle approached.And they thought they had hauled themselves back level in the nd minute only to be left cursing a mistaken offside flag.Rovers built up brilliantly down the left to buy Ross Matthews space. His cutback was swept into the six-yard box by Lewis Vaughan and Reghan Tumilty hammered in from close range.However, referee Nick Walsh cut short the celebrations.Raith would have harboured a sense of injustice as they came out for the second-half, but their task got even harder just nine minutes after the break.Again, Adam was the creator with another stunning pass from the centre of the pitch and once more it was McGhee who was the willing runner.The midfielder outstripped the Rovers rearguard and slid a composed finish beyond MacDonald.With Raith forced to desperately seek a way back into the tie, Dundee hit them with a sucker punch.Adams fed Max Anderson and he picked out the run of fellow substitute Sow, who fired high into the net.Fans will be back inside Dens Park NEXT WEEK #Dundee find a way past Raith Rovers\" title\"#Fans will be back inside Dens Park NEXT WEEK #Dundee find a way past Raith Rovers# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp fans-will-be-back-inside-dens-park-next-week--dundee-find-a-way-past-raith-rovers embed # secretDuHoygWtO\" data-secret\"DuHoygWtO\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-memories-milton-couples-love-lasted-lifetime","story":"A PICTURE paints a thousand words, the old saying goes."},{"url":null,"title":"louisa-jordan-katherine-watt---great-glasgow-nurses-celebrated-international-nurses-day","story":"WE all have a reason to be grateful for nurses and today is all about a celebration in their honour."},{"url":null,"title":"kenmure-street-nicola-sturgeon-condemns-glasgow-immigration-removals","story":"NICOLA Sturgeon has expressed her consternation after police were called to a Glasgow street where protesters are trying to prevent immigration officers from removing people from a property."},{"url":null,"title":"green-msp-elected-holyroods-new-presiding-officer","story":"SCOTTISH Green MSP Alison Johnstone has been elected as Holyroodrsquos new Presiding Officer."},{"url":null,"title":"call-main-govan-roads-redesigned","story":"A GREEN councillor is calling for main roads in Govan to be redesigned to improve walking and cycling routes."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-touching-hugging-much-needed-part-life","story":"I asked my  year old patient last week about what was the thing they missed most and that they couldnrsquot wait to do once things went back to normal.

in a coastal Aberdeen suburb will begin this month.Stewart Milne Homes is preparing to build the properties for social rent on land overlooking the North Sea beside Falkland Avenue in Cove Bay, locally referred to as Stationfields.The firm says the homes will help to meet the “signicant demand” in the city, but the scheme has sparked anger from nearby residents.More than  objections were lodged by locals, urging council officers not to green-light the plans over concerns including overdevelopment and the impact on school spaces.Others were worried more homes were being proposed for the site than allowed for in the local development plan, and that they would appear “alien” to their surroundings.Council officers addressed some of these fears in a -page document granting planning permission for the proposals.They said the move from  allocated homes to  is not signicant enough to “constitute a departure” from the previously laid plans.It has also been determined the development will provide an #adequate and appropriate# level of open space, without impacting wildle or the popular nearby coastal path.The council document says the scheme “takes into account, but does not replicate” the character of surrounding houses, and will not affect the nearby Cove Bay conservation area.A total of  conditions for the scheme have also been stipulated, which Stewart Milne must now meet.These include the provision of full-fibre broadband, electric vehicle charging points and #trespass-proof# fences along the boundary with the Aberdeen-Dundee railway line.Once the houses have been built by Stewart Milne, they will be handed over to Hillcrest Homes for social rent.Richard Fawcus, the land director for Stewart Milne Homes, said: “This development is the outcome of a partnership approach, working closely with Aberdeen City Council, the Scottish Government and Hillcrest to provide much-needed affordable housing in this popular part of the city.“These homes will ensure that the many people who wish to remain in Cove will now have the opportunity to do so.“We’ve a strong working relationship with Hillcrest, having recently completed homes for them at Countesswells, Kingswells and Abbotswell Road.“On completion of these homes at Falkland Avenue, we will have delivered over  homes in Aberdeen with Hillcrest since Autumn .“These developments not only provide affordable housing, to meet the signicant demand in Aberdeen, but also create and safeguard construction jobs.”Fiona Morrison, Hillcrest deputy chief executive, said: #We are delighted to be bringing much needed social and mid-market rent homes to Cove in partnership with Stewart Milne Homes, Aberdeen City Council and the Scottish Government.“These will be more than just new affordable properties for the area # they will be homes that people with a range of needs can thrive and take pride in.”While not referenced in the planning documents, it has been hoped that the land at Stationfields could also house a new train station for Cove.It is one of several potential sites which have been identied to the south of Aberdeen, with others including Altens and Newtonhill.Last year regional transport body Nestrans launched an £, study to consider whether the proposals could be feasible.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

lead city centre businesses through the next five years and the Covid recovery kicked off last night as a ballot opened on the future of Aberdeen Inspired.A month-long ballot of premise owners within business improvement districtlaunched yesterday, as the current five-year term comes to an end for Aberdeen Inspired.Leading businessmen last night praised the organisation and urged people to back the initiative for another five years # while others demanded its demise.The Bid covers theof Union Street, up to John Street in the north to Union Square in the south.By charging a mandatory extra % on business rates for qualying firms, the trade association has taken in around £ million annually from around  businesses within its footprint.Aberdeen Inspired was the driving force behind bringing the Nuart street art festival – and with it around , visitors and £m #marketing value# – to the city in recent years as well as Restaurant Week, which recently bolstered hospitality takings by %, and Aberdeen’s comedy and jazz festivals.And due to the #challenging times# brought about by the pandemic, the levy has been halved to only .% between  and .In the last year alone, Aberdeen Inspired brought £m into the city centre in additional funding.If ed for another five years, owners of all premises with a rateable value of more than £, will have to pay # but they will get a vote for each qualying property.The % levy is already claimed to be the lowest in the country, around £ a week on average, or # as Aberdeen Inspired stated earlier in the week # the price of two cups of coffee.But Mike Wilson, head of Epic Group which owns Chaophraya, the Monkey House, Prohibition and The Priory in the city centre, said they will be culpable for much more.He said: “If it’s only a few cups of coffee, I’ll buy them two cups of coffee every weekthey pay my Bid levy.#Every business is struggling and this is burdening them with additional financial impediments that could be make or break.“My view is Aberdeen city centre without a shadow of a doubt needs support and TLC but we need professionals doing that.“Not painting buildings – long term structural change as opposed to a quango skimming % on top of everyone’s rates.#Mr Wilson added: #I urge businesses not to support the renewal of the bid, without structural change.#A simple % majority is required for its renewal, with voting closing at pm on June .Meanwhile, while the anti-Bid brigade urged people to vote no, a leading figure in Scottish business threw his weight behind Aberdeen Inspired#s Back the Bid campaign.Former chief executive of Aberdeen Standards Investments Martin Gilbert said the importance of the trade body should not be lost on people.“We cannot underestimate the importance that Aberdeen city centre holds to the wider city and region,” he said.“It provides employment for many thousands and its state of health is often taken as a measure of the wider north-east economic well-being.“As a proud Aberdonian, I naturally want to see our city centre thrive, but this will require even more of a focus by the private and public sectors to effectively work together through the demanding period that lies ahead.“Aberdeen Inspired has already demonstrated the value it brings to the heart of our city and moving forward it has a crucial role in bringing about the required change.”And John Michie, who started the Aberdeen Bid in , said he could not think of #better value for money# than thefirms get on the levy.He told us: #I am very anxious, on behalf of the Union Street and the Bid area at the heart of the city.#It impacts everyone, not just those who live in Aberdeen but in Aberdeenshire too.#The board#s goal is the maintenance and development of our city centre and I cannot see a downside, except of course that we have to pay some money.#But in terms of marketing and advertising I cannot think of better value for money than contributing to the Bid and in practice this year they are offering a discount.#We are all strapped for cash just now with uncertainty over the customer base and this partnership is incredibly important.#City councillors will meet in just over a month to debate the local authority#s stance on the Bid.With so many properties within the city centre zone, their several votes could prove crucial in determining the outcome # and the future path for traders, publicans, hoteliers and restaurateurs in Aberdeen.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

celebrating rural creative talent from across Aberdeenshire will open in Turrf this weekend.AB Creatives will be in the grounds of Delgatie Castle in Turrf for two weeks, starting from Saturday, May . It can be enjoyed at any time of day.The exhibit is being run by Megan Thores, final year student from Gray#s School of Art in Aberdeen.AB started as a series of podcast episodes aimed at connecting artists in rural areas.Miss Thores was inspired to organise this event to show that creatives didn#t need to move to the #big city# to be successful. She said: “I found through my time at uni there was a lot of mention about moving to the big city. This was something I never saw on my cards and led me to create ‘AB Creatives’.#I want to show just how much creativity can be found in Aberdeenshire and how successful people are doing.#https:www.instagram p CKRMCQpFn The event is free to enter and showcases a wide range of creative talent from florists to weavers. All the artists at the event are from rural communities in Aberdeenshire.The student added: “I really hope as many people can come along to the event. It’s free to enter and all the artists involved are using locally sourced wood to show their work, which they’ll hang in the grounds of the castle.”Miss Thores is in her final year of communication design at the art school.Iain Morrison, Stage  coordinator for communication design at Gray’s School of Art, highlighted the importance of supporting rural talent following the pandemic.He said: “It is fantastic that the ‘AB Creatives’ is opening to the public this weekend. It has been a dficult time for artists across the north east but this exciting exhibition showcases their creativity in the face of COVID- and brings together artists working in challenging

part of the effort to tackle the transmission of the virus, NHS Grampian accelerated vaccine rollout in Moray, which will still include second doses being administered within  weeks of the first

politics and more action is needed to increase access to those who continue to experience barriers, women#s groups claim.The May  election marks a historic moment in women#s representation at parliament with a record  women MSPs elected, making up % of the members at Holyrood.However, the last parliamentary session saw several female MSPs step away from politics because of the challenges in juggling political le with the demands of a young family.Former MSPs Gail Ross and Jenny Marra both made the decision to quit parliament in part because of the conflict between their personal and professional lives.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, they were vocal in calling for digital technology to be used to allow MSPs to participate virtually in parliament but were told the capability was not there.However, now with digital working the norm for so many, calls have been made to allow it to continue beyond the crisis and into the future.Talat Yaqoob, co-founder of Women :, which campaigns for % representation for women in the Scottish Parliament, local councils and public boards, says while progress #should be celebrated#, it has been #too long coming#.She believes political parties should continue to use mechanisms to #create a level playing field# and argues for the introduction of legislated candidate quotas to #embed fair representation of women into law#.She adds: #There are still too many women, particularly from working class backgrounds and BAME communities, who remain excluded from politics.#We saw many women leave politics in  and they cited the unrealistic pressure of being an MSP, having caring responsibilities and being expected to travel to, and remain in, Edinburgh to participate in parliamentary work.#We need the Scottish Parliament to embrace a more modern democracy which allows remote working and flexibility, taking into account that this would signicantly increase access to political roles for those who continue to experience barriers.#Research tells us that more representative politics can deliver more inclusive policy, which in our Covid- recovery is critical in creating a fairer Scotland however, we cannot take this for granted, so we must continue to participate in politics beyond the election and hold power to account.#Ken Macintosh, former presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament, said the decision on whether to continue with virtual participation would be #one of the first# decisions new presiding officer Alison Johnstone will have to make.He told BBC Good Morning Scotland on Thursday that #you wouldn#t wish to uninvent these new technologies and the access that gives to all parts of Scotland# and added it had been a #real boon in many ways#.However, he said when MSPs participate online they #can#t give and take interventions in a debate, you miss the mood, you can#t read the chamber#. #It#s all anchored about a pm decision time. That by itself makes it, and limiting our hours to make sure parliament meets on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday but politics is not family-friendly.#People want access to you at all times of day and night so the business is not family-friendly but the parliament and the institution and its workings can be made as family-friendly as possible.#Emma Ritch, executive director of Engender, Scotland’s feminist policy and advocacy organisation, says while the record in the number of women at Holyrood is to be celebrated, the #fight for women#s equal representation is far from over#.She adds there are #deeply ingrained sexist attitudes and traditions# in democratic processes which need tackled to #avoid recreating the situation we saw earlier this year where signicant numbers of female MSPs stood down due to issues around lack of appropriate childcare, excessive workload, and harassment#.Ms Ritch adds: #The pandemic has shown us that many seemingly intractable problems can be solved home working , greater use of technology, remote appointments.#This has made a huge dference to people traditionally excluded from politics due to disability, caring responsibilities, poverty and poor transport links.#Let’s not rush ‘back to business as usual’ but instead take this learning and think critically about how we can make elected office work for women.#A family-friendly parliament  MSPs, including former party leaders, tell us why Holyrood has to change\" title\"#A family-friendly parliament  MSPs, including former party leaders, tell us why Holyrood has to change# # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news politics scottish-politics  a-family-friendly-parliament-msps-including-former-party-leaders-tells-us-why-holyrood-has-to-change embed # secretsJbpDAH\" data-secret\"sJbpDAH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/demographics-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

million investment programme, which took place over the course of three months.A number of important projects were successfully completed, including the replacement of the low-pressure turbine rotor, turbine valve inspections and detailed inspections of the graphite core.At its peak, more than  people were present on site including visiting contractors.Despite this, both industrial and Covid- safety were maintained.Tam Albishawi, station director at the power station to the east of Dunbar, was pleased with how the outage had gone.He said: ldquoOutages are always planned scrupulously to ensure they run well and we took the same approach to managing Covid during an outage.ldquoAs well as putting in place a strict testing regime, we ensured the enforcement of social distancing, regular hand washing and mandatory mask wearing on site.ldquoI am glad that the measures we put in place kept rates so low, keeping people on site and in the community safe.ldquoIn addition to tackling the usual big maintenance projects, the team have also inspected the reactorrsquos graphite core as part on an ongoing inspection programme happening at each of our stations and these checks have confirmed that all is as expected.ldquoEveryone involved worked really hard to make sure we were able to deliver one of our best ever outages and I am delighted that the unit is back online and helping Britain achieve net zero.Covid was a particular focus of the outage, which had been postponed from summer last year to allow for better arrangements to be introduced nationally and at the site.EDF acted early to introduce ldquostringent protective measures including social distancing, mandatory face masks, thermographic cameras and working from home, where possible, which helped keep on-site rates consistently low.The company also invested in mass testing capability and required visiting contractors to register a negative test before entering the site, as well as at least weekly testing for all those working there.A spokeswoman for EDF said: ldquoOver the -week outage period, we carried out almost , tests and recorded  Covid positive cases.ldquoAlmost all of these cases were asymptomatic and detected due to the rigorous testing regime put in place by EDF to protect those on site and in the wider community.ldquoThe ability to identy these cases meant that workers were able to immediately self-isolate while close contacts were traced and asked not to come to site. All cases were reported to public health authorities.The outage, which got under way in January, also boosted the local economy, with a number of the key workers staying in local hotels.Last year, Torness generated enough low-carbon electricity to power . million homes more than the number of households in Scotland.The station employs more than  full-time staff and about  full-time contract partners to ensure the safe reliable generation of electricity."},{"url":null,"title":"call-donate-carrier-bags-faside-community-pantry","story":"Volunteer Centre East Lothian is based on the townrsquos High Street and is home to Farsquoside Community Pantry.The pantry is open Mondays-Fridays, am-pm.While all donations are gratefully accepted, it is on the lookout for carrier bags which will be used to hand out items to the iniduals and families it helps.Pre-made bags are handed out at the centre door as visitors are not able to enter the building due to coronavirus restrictions.

Bees and other pollinating insects will be on the hunt at other times of year too,\" says Perry. \"Spring nectar sources can help pollinators to refuel after their hibernation period, and in autumn it can help them build energy reserves for the winter months. Be sure to plant with the widest range of blooming periods in mind, so the wildle never goes hungry.\"The calendar is designed to help gardeners of all abilities turn their outdoor spaces into a pollinator paradise all year round, buzzing with a riot of colour, texture and scent and a perfect way to contribute to World Bee Day .These are some of the plants which Perry recommends to help bees through all four seasons...SPRINGLungwort - the lovely lungwort flower grows low to the ground, and blooms early to bring food to the first pollinators of spring. They grow best in containers, so theyre great for planting in a small space.Peony - these pink beauties are rich in pollen, and pollinating insects love their single blooms. Plant your peonies in rich, dry soil in the sun.Magnolia - our buzzing buddies are drawn to the magnicent magnolias saucer-sized blooms, and love to snack on their sweet nectar. Magnolias love sun and acid soil with lots of moisture.Pussy willow - pussy willow pollen is high in protein, and the spring bloom provides an early source of nutrition for our busy friends.SUMMERLavender - At home in a Mediterranean style garden and also in pots or as a low hedge for potagers, lavender produces both pollen and nectar, making it a great food source for honey bees. They even create lavender-flavoured honey from the plant. Lavender does well in full sun in sandy or chalky, well-drained soil - nothing thats too rich.Foxglove - honey bees and bumblebees work together to pollinate this classic cottage garden favourite. The bumblebee creates holes in the side of the flower to make it easier for the honey bee to swoop in and access the flowers pollen.Hawthorn - our hive heroes can make dark and rich honey from hawthorn nectar. This flower grows best in sunny conditions and is tolerant of all soil types.Marjoram - marjoram is a favourite of humans and our pollinating pals alike - these nectar-rich flowers are actually a perennial herb and close relative of oregano.AUTUMNAster - these pretty perennials with daisy-like flowers ying from purple, violet, and lavender to pink with orange-yellow centres, need lots of water. Its worth adding a mulch to retain the moisture, but theyre worth it to keep the bees happy and help honey bees build up reserves of pollen for winter to get them through the cold months. Plant asters in full sun for them to shine.Honeysuckle - This fast-growing climber, which can be deciduous or evergreen, bearing blooms ranging from creamy-white through yellow to red, is famed for its powerful scent and is a magnet for bees. It starts to flower in the summer but can continue to autumn, given the right conditions. It prefers a sunny spot and isnt fussy about the soil.Single-bloom dahlias - If youre wanting to attract bees, go for the single bloom types of dahlia such as the Happy Single Series over the other ieties such as pompoms or balls, which are less accessible to insects.Sedum - Their pretty flowerheads are full of nectar which makes these low-growing perennials perfect for the front of a border or in prairie plantings, flowering right through to October. Sedum flowers are perfect for honey bees as a late source of pollen and nectar, helping to build up honey stores for the colder winter.WINTERWinter aconite - these low-growing small tuberous perennials from the buttercup family produce bright yellow cup-shaped flowers which are good for ground cover and provide a burst of winter and spring colour under shrubs and roses.Mahonia - Clusters of highly scented bright yellow flowers appear in winter on these tough, spiky evergreen shrubs which are easy to grow, produce lots of nectar and also provide purple to black berries in the autumn, a feast for the birds.Helleborus - hellebores provide sugar-rich nectar and high-protein pollen to help keep the bees energetic and strong through the middle of winter. They thrive in alkaline soil and their subtle shades ranging from cream to deep purple will bring le to a darker area, as they are tolerant of shade.Snowdrop - these pint-sized beauties are among the first bulbs to emerge in winter, providing rich nectar when other food is hard to find. Plant dferent ieties which flower at dferent times in winter to give the bees a longer foraging season.Crocus - these hardy flowers can break through ice and snow to bring food to winter honey bees. Plant them in the sun so that the flowers will fully open and make it easier for the bees to forage on the nectar. Crocuses naturalise well so can create carpets of colourful flowers in winter.For more information on the Hives For Lives programme visit rowsehoney."},{"url":null,"title":"recipe-rhubarb-strawberry-double-crust-pie---perfect-alfresco-tea-party","story":"Ingredientsg rhubarb tablespoons muscovado sugarZest of an unwaxed lemon and a squeeze of juice teaspoon grated fresh ginger strawberriesFor the pastryg self-rising flour, sievedg ground almondsg caster sugarPinch of saltg cold unsalted butter, cubed free range egg yolk-  tablespoons iced waterA little milk to wash.A -cm oven-proof plate, well butteredPrepare the fillingWash and trim the rhubarb and cut into pieces.

In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence. On taking back control,you like. Rather than fleeing from a perceived threat.That is why SNP Ministers have been so keen to govern moderately and sensibly, within existing devolved powers, while simultaneously promoting independence.Read more from Brian Taylor: Why Nicola Sturgeon offers her supporters Paradise DeferredBrexit, in particular, may create the conditions for revisiting the independence prospect, not least because Scotland was told that staying in the UK was the only way to retain EU membership.However, add Brexit to the virus and economic worries.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year. May we never see its likes again."},{"url":null,"title":"pro-union-parties-indyref2-obsession-fuelling-debate","story":"In part, this obsession has led to the SNP being let off the hook for its failures in government as was reflected in this weekendrsquos election results and perpetuated by every media outlet across the country zoning in on constitutional questions.Over the past few weeks, the majority of pro-Union politicians have used every sound clip offered to them to exclaim their anti-independence thoughts rather than explain how they propose to get this country back on its feet and how they could work with the Government to put recovery first.With all eyes focused on the constitution, it has worked in the favour of the SNP who have managed to be elected to Government with a record number of votes, despite their failings over the past  years in charge.The First Minister herself admitted during the campaign that she had taken her ldquoeye off the ball as Scotland racked up the highest drugs death in Europe. But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons. Local businesses desperate to rebuild and get customers in their doors.Economic recovery is what matters to so many, yet we are so embroiled in constitutional questions that we lose sight of the ramications the past year has had for so many businesses and iniduals who have lost their jobs and families living below thepoverty line.There is no denying the fact that there is indeed an appetite to reopen the debate around independence, the recent vote shows an almost   split down the middle, but I do not believe it should be up to the media to frame the discussion.There is a huge job ahead for the next Scottish Government to deliver on a national recovery and all opposition politicians and members of the press must be focused on holding them accountable for the measures they are taking to get the country back on its feet.Letrsquos not do Alex Salmondrsquos job for him by inadvertently holding the SNPrsquos feet to the fire over independence but instead hold their feet to the fire over the nationrsquos recovery from the pandemic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It didnrsquot even rain. Alba failed to register even % in the election ndash yet because of defections it has representatives in the House of Commons and Scottish councils.The two MPs are Kenny MacAskill and Neale Hanvey. The case around Hanvey is a little more complicated than MacAskill, whorsquos a straightforward defector from the SNP to Alba.In , Hanvey was the SNPrsquos candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. He was dropped in November over using anti-semitic language on social media. Despite his suspension, Hanvey appeared on the ballot next to the SNP name as the deadline for candidates to be nominated had passed.After election, he initially sat as an independent. He apologised for anti-semitic language and was readmitted to the SNP. In , he was appointed the SNPrsquos spokesperson for the Westminster Health and Social Care Select Committee. This March, Hanvey, together with Kenny MacAskill who was elected as the SNP MP for East Lothian, and a number of SNP councillors, defected to Alba. NEIL MACKAY: The Alba effectClearly, voters represented by Hanvey, MacAskill and others ndash such as the Inverclyde councillor Christopher McEleny ndash didnrsquot vote for them as members of Alba. So surely, the only honourable course of action is for these defectors to stand down immediately and submit themselves to by-elections. If the people they currently represent still find them suitable as representatives, then all well and good. However, to cling on to position, power and a public pay cheque in the current circumstances is surely morally untenable, even cowardly.This week Neale Hanvey denounced the SNP as toxic, aggressive and hostile, saying he ldquodetested what the party had become. It would evidently be best policy, perhaps, for all concernedhe makes a clear and irrevocable split with the SNP, putting himself up for re-election on an Alba ticket so he cannot be accused of riding into a job on the coattails of a party he evidently loathes.On a wider stage, matters are currently going very badly for prominent Alba supporters. Craig Murray, a former British diplomat who became a blogger and cheerleader for Alex Salmond, was sentenced to eight months in prison this week for contempt of court relating to the trial of the former First Minister. Judges ruled Murray in contempt relating to material capable of identying four complainers in the case.The future looks shaky too for the nationalist marching organisation All Under One Banner. One of its key figures, Neil MacKay , made great play on social media of showing support for the Alba Party, attracting ridicule and rage from mainstream Yes voters. Some people who previously took part in the rallies have sworn never to attend again, seeing the organisation tainted by Alba support.Itrsquos also a rather embarrassing time for whatrsquos been termed the lsquoalt-nat blogospherersquo which rallied to Salmondrsquos party. Their role was seen as a major turn-off factor when it came to Alba, with ordinary voters repelled by a toxic mix of conspiracy theories, hate and bigotry.Therersquos speculation that Salmond could have done somewhat better at the polls ndash despite his own low approval ratings ndashhersquod wisely kept clear of such characters.Kenny MacAskillThese online voices are really left with nowhere to go now, but further down the rabbit holes theyrsquove been digging for themselves and their diminishing bands of followers for years. They imagined Nicola Sturgeon ousted from office in the wake of the Salmond inquiries and Alba holding seats in Holyrood. Theyrsquove been repeatedly proved wrong.The more tricky question regarding the aftermath of Alba is what Sturgeon should do about those thorns in her side, and the side of the SNP, who many suspected of planning to jump ship to Alba, but when the crunch came seemingly lacked the courage to defect.Although it was all rumour and zero proof, there was intense speculation MPs Angus MacNeil and Joanna Cherry would defect. Both dismissed the idea.However, previous interventions by Cherry and MacNeil have made le dficult for the SNP and Nicola Sturgeon. Both are seen as having undermined Sturgeonrsquos leadership, and ndash whether they like it or not ndash perceived as central to the long-running civil war within the ranks of the SNP which caused considerable damage to the party.Whatrsquos clear now, though, is that with the defeat of Alba and its rejection by the electorate, Sturgeon is in a strong position to crack down on any dissent in the ranks. It might well become a rather tough season for the SNPrsquos erstwhile awkward squad.There were recent reports that Alex Salmond claimed he could have lsquodestroyedrsquo Nicola Sturgeon. The only thing which has been destroyed is Albarsquos hopes of gaining any traction with the Scottish people. Salmond, however, insists that his party will ldquobloom. The former First Minister is entitled to think what he wishes, but his hopes seem unlikely to be fulfilled. NEIL MACKAY: Salmonds Trumpian circusSalmond is on much firmer ground with his recent warning that ldquoonline warriors are a problem in modern politics. Hersquos undoubtedly correct. So it was a little discomfiting to see him in a online discussion say ndash in jest, it appeared ndash that ldquoone day Irsquom going to unleash myself on Twitter now that Donald Trump has created a vacuum for me.Salmond still casts a long shadow. The husband of one of the women in the Salmond case recently said that the former First Ministerrsquosto the political spotlight had left his we ldquoincapacitated by depression. We must remember Salmond was cleared of all charges.Salmond could change a lothe took just a few simple steps. Apologise for his past behaviour as Nicola Sturgeon has advised him to do, and distance himself from the coterie of extremist voices which surround him. He could also advise the defectors from the SNP to Alba to show the courage of their convictions and face by-election.

It looks like the UK announcement means whatever is set up will take a four-nations approach, or at least there will be consultation across governments to see how viable that is.This announcement is welcome but overdue, as groups including the Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice group have been calling for an inquiry since last July.Public inquiries take time to set up and then to gather evidence and report. This process is likely to take years rather than months. Findings will help longer term planning but will not change much,anything, soon.:Covid Glasgow: Spike in the city needs a robust response, says Prof Linda BauldIn the meantime we are beginning to see other review mechanisms be established internationally that are already aiming to learn lessons from recent months. Their findings should help us here in Scotland to try and chart a steady course in the short term and also point to issues that need examined in our own inquiries.The first formal review of the global response to Covid- was published this week. This was a report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response . It was convened in September  and made up of  members from dferent countries, co-chaired by Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia. The  reviewed a range of evidence and spoke to many experts and dferent groups. They reflected on the fact that the pandemic has been the worst health, social and economic crisis in living memory, with  million people infected and over three million deaths up to the end of April , although this is likely an underestimate.What the IPPPR report makes clear is that the pandemic was preventable, and argues that there hasnrsquot been sufficient learning from previous infectious disease epidemics like Ebola and SARS. While experts have mapped out how to plan for, prevent, or at least mitigate the impact of these crises, their recommendations have not been taken seriously enough.The report has a strong focus on the global level but also makes recommendations for countries, how they can contribute internationally, and what they need to do within their own borders. This has implications for Scotland and indeed how any enquiry is conducted here or at UK level.The report is an example of the benefits of conducting an inquiry early, because some of its recommendations need to be implemented now to accelerate recovery and prevent more deaths globally. It also includes longer term recommendations. Immediate priorities are around vaccines.The report recommends that high income countries like the UK that have already secured enough vaccines to protect their own populations should, while still delivering jags into arms domestically, provide low and middle income countries with at least one billion vaccine doses by the autumn of this year, with more to follow in .The mechanism for this is Covax, the Covid- vaccines global access facility which the UK joined in September last year. They also recommend waiving intellectual property rights on vaccinesto allow more countries to manufacture vaccines themselves.:Westminster sketch: Boris Johnson calms down about Scotland and promises Duchy courage from GoveLooking ahead, IPPPR also sets out what needs to change in global health governance. They call for more funding for the World Health Organisation from inidual countries, rather than forcing the WHO to rely on big philanthropic organisations. Plus they ask the United Nations to set up a global threats council to coordinate international and national pandemic preparedness, and call for a new international pandemic financing facility.The  praises some countries for their response to Covid- and roundly criticises others, without naming names. Some countries suffered from poor leadership and slow and insufficient action, downplayed risks and didnrsquot take sufficient account of evidence on whatto do.Looking ahead, they point to some key lessons. The first is the need for strong leadership and coordination ndash a lsquowhole of governmentrsquo response to continue to address Covid-. Investing in preparation now for future crises with access to rapid and accurate data and knowing who is accountable for which actions. Having national plans in place for supplies , diagnostics, medicines and vaccines. Plus, setting aside funds for preparation that can be quickly accessed to deal with outbreaks or future threats. These issues will undoubtedly come up in an inquiry into the pandemic here in Scotland and across the UK.There is a final point from this report that is worth emphasising. It isnrsquot enough for international or national authorities to simply instruct people how to behave when a crisis hits. Itrsquos much more effectivepeople can get involved, be listened to and feel they have a stake in a collective response.As we look ahead to a public inquiry on Covid-, the most important voices will be those of the people of Scotland. Not just the families who have lost loved ones but also those working on the front line, and those affected by the measures taken to address the pandemic. It is their experiences that can help us learn lessons and prevent this from happening again.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of EdinburghOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Good judgment and circumstance can mean that they survive for many years but, usually, the longer the same party stays in power, the harder things get.Events happen and problems multiply, which, like chained balls, progressively weigh the incumbents down. Familiarity begins to breed contempt with disgruntled voters while political enemies increase, particularly on the governing partyrsquos benches and especially among those colleagues sacked or overlooked. Divisions deepen and voters realise the once all-conquering heroes have become tired, out-dated failures and so turf them out.The other side of the equation involves an Opposition, heavily defeated and lost for direction.Read more:Will Boris announce Indyref It can be in the political wilderness for years, changing leaders as it struggles to find a core message that resonates with voters.Riven by factions, the would-be government canrsquot seem to understand what the public wants and lurches from defeat to defeat. Then, after yet another humiliating loss, it peers nervously over the abyss and, seeing what oblivion looks like, sharply steps back and begins the slow and painful process of reinvention.It admits its failures, begins to listen again to the public. Hungry for ideas, it talks to focus groups, calls in all manner of experts, think-tanks and voluntary organisations. Gradually, the Dr Who-like transmogrication occurs.A new party with a fresh outlook emerges. Brimming with ideas, enthusiasm and energy, it puts itself forward and the public like what they see. The cycle of democracy repeats itself over again.It is often in defeat that the seeds of victory are sown and, indeed, vice versa.In February , less than two years after Tony Blairrsquos second landslide victory, an embattled Iain Duncan Smith appealed to his ided party to ldquounite or die. He urged the Tories to change or face annihilation. They did change they changed him.His successor, Michael Howard, failed to make a breakthrough in the  election but saw Mr Blairrsquos majority fall sharply, by  to , and the Tories, three-time losers, reached out for change and found the fresh-faced, relatively unknown liberal Conservative David Cameron.Meanwhile in Downing Street, an impatient Gordon Brown finally prised out Mr Blair, got the job he felt he should have had in  but lost the election in .As Mr Cameron and countless party leaders have found reinvention is a tortuous but essential process of democratic politics it is now what Sir Keir and his colleagues have to undertakethey are to stand any chance of taking power at Westminster in   and prevent a fth Conservative government.Following last weekrsquos Super Thursday elections, when Labour made some gains, most notably in the English mayoral contests, but more prominently lost the Hartlepool by-election and hundreds of council seats to the Tories, the party leader compounded the overall poor performance by first ldquoscapegoating Angela Rayner and then over-compensating for his failure to sack his deputy by showering her with an abundance of new positions from shadow first secretary of state, and shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to shadow secretary of state for the future of work. It looked like what it was: Sir Keir acting out of weakness.The episode enabled the normally beleaguered Boris Johnson to make hay at the Labour knightrsquos expense.Read more:Sir Keir Starmer now faces a major rethink and resetNoting how the most dangerous beast in the pack was the lioness not the lion, he told Sir Keir: ldquoThe more titles he feeds her, the hungrier I fear she is likely to become.Following what she euphemistically labelled ldquorobust conversations with the party leader, Ms Rayner, a Manchester MP tasked with rekindling Labourrsquos relationship with northern England, admitted voters said ldquothey didnrsquot know what Keir Starmer stood for, so thatrsquos what our challenge is.

Quite an indictment.Helpfully, on cue, the Corbynite old guard appeared and trashed the party leader for abandoning their approach, which  months ago led to Labourrsquos worst defeat since .John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said Labour faced a struggle for its ldquosoul and future, and, clearly fearing a move towards the centre, urged supporters to join a campaign to ensure it remained a ldquosocialist party, that would win the next election on a socialist manesto.Time is not on Labourrsquos side, however. It does not have the luxury of spending months indulging in ision and recrimination. It cannot afford to engage in old Left-Right battles of the past that crippled the party during the s.Mr Blair, who unlike Jeremy Corbyn led Labour to not one but three consecutive General Election victories, said what Labour now needed was ldquototal deconstruction and reconstruction nothing less will do.Interestingly, he noted: ldquoAt present, Labour expresses perfectly the progressive dilemma: Corbyn was radical but not sensible Keir seems sensible but not radical. He lacks a compelling economic message.Borisrsquos ldquojabs and jobs mantra is clearly breaking through with voters south of the Border, most notably in those areas where traditional loyalties to Labour, as in Scotland, have become frayed or broken.Labour needs to find a compelling mission statement based on optimism, community and jobs the only problem is, this is the tune the Tories are singing. Labourrsquos has to sound sweeter.As Britain emerges from the blight of the pandemic and seeks to chart its post-Brexit future, it will need a strong opposition at Westminster, a forceful alternative to hold the incumbent government in Whitehall to account.Itrsquos time for Labour to step up and reinvent itself for the health of our democracy.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Itrsquos recognising that Doric, Scots, Gaelic and Orcadian, indigenous languages which have for so long been looked down on as second-class, as markers of an educational deficit, are fit for purpose and deserve their place in our parliament. Itrsquos telling speakers of Urdu, Punjabi, Arabic, Shona, German, Welsh and Canadian French that they are valued members of our society and itrsquos telling users of British Sign Language that they, too are recognised, visible and acknowledged.Looking in particular at the indigenous languages of Scotland, elected representatives using them in parliament, even in this small way, is important for those of us who speak one of them as our first language. It provides a counter-narrative to the idea that these languages, and by extension their speakers, are somehow deficient. Gaelic and Scots did not become minority languages because their speakers fancied a change.Itrsquos not that English is an inherently superior language, itrsquos that English became the only means by which people could access an education. The  EducationAct provided education for all the children of Scotland, but provided it only in English. Between  and , Gaelic wasnrsquot even taught as a subject in areas where it was the first language of the majority of the population. Instead of being taught to read and write in their mother tongue, children were physically punished for speaking it. Parents were told that persisting in speaking Gaelic or Scots to their children was preventing them from becoming fluent in English, and thereby hampering their education.This isnrsquot in the dim and distant past, it was happening less than a century ago. Even now, although the SQA has a Scots language award, there is no National  or Higher available. These things are important for the status of a language. Gaelic is in a stronger position in this regard, with Gaelic-medium education available from pre-school to postgraduate study, but only in a minority of schools and universities, my own institution being one of them. This is why it is signicant that six of the MSPs representing the Highlands and Islandschose to include Gaelic when being sworn in. They said a lot more by doing that than the few words needed for the oath or affirmation.What was particularly heartening, looking at the list of MSPs who chose to use languages other than English in Holyrood yesterday was that they came from a iety of political stances. Representatives of the Scottish Greens, Scottish Labour, Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish National Party all stood and raised their right hand and affirmed that a language other than English was valid. lsquoS math a rinn iad uile.Dr Anne Frater is a senior lecturer in the Gaelic Section of the University of Highlands and Islands, and is the programme leader of BAH Gaelic Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-scottish-tories-play-rules","story":"Today we know it is part of the brain, with some people being able to exert more self-control in their anger management than others.

A leaflet from the SNP candidate came through my letterbox. It invited me to get in contact and so on Monday, May  I sent a question by email. There was no reply so I chased up a response with further emails on Wednesday, May  and Monday, May . I have still heard nothing.Perhaps only sycophantic questions are permitted or only ones that SNP staff approve of. Or perhaps the SNP has been dominant in Scottish politics for so long that voters are simply taken for granted. It may be that horrible entitled arrogance that the SNPused to accuse other political parties of, before becoming the establishment itself.My question was quite simple. I am keen to see ethics prevail in politics. Why should I compromise my principles by voting for a candidate whose party leader was found to have misled the Scottish Parliament  I would feel very uncomfortable voting for someone guilty of serious deceit. There may be many responses to this, but I am left none the wiser.I really wish candidates wouldnt ask us voters to get in touch when they have no interest in our views.David Kennedy, Airdrie.THE GLOOM OF A NEW DAWNTHE new intake at Holyrood has just started and already the problems are piling up: huge potential taxpayers bills and an essential ferry service that is not working, especially at the start of the SNPs \"staycation\" drive .

However, I fear that he is missing the point, in that many Scots were only voting to push for that event alone, and not a vote for independence.The SNP needs to have a clear, concise and robust plan laid out in front of the electorate, prior to any referendum, as to how independence is going to operate and be funded. I have this nagging doubt in my mind, thata referendum goes against the nationalist movement, they will immediately still behave like a dog with a bone, and never let go. Discussions must be arranged, so that vitally important and mutually agreed terms on the operation of a referendum, and its final result, can be set up.George Dale, Beith.IT WONT BE WORTH ITDURING the election, one broadcaster described Andrew Wilson, author of the now ldquoout of date Sustainable Growth Commission, as ldquothe brains behind the SNP. On at least two occasions on the run-up to the election Mr Wilson stated that independence ldquowill not be easy but will be worth it. The majority of Scots whose votes outnumbered those of the SNP and Greens are earnestly waiting for evidence that the massive disruption of separation will be worth it.Once the people of Scotland are made aware of what is in store with SNP proposals, I doubt very muchthey will agree that it will be worth it. The SNP also has to explain what ldquowill not be easy. Since , Nicola Sturgeon has failed to offer any analysis or research into the economic implications of independence.

For every school in every local authority area across Scotland. Its the worst day of the year.Yet the league tables are astonishingly well read. Parents love them. I wonder how they use them. I find it hard to believe that parents make a choice of school based on the league tables, given the tiny fluctuations between those at the top, and given the logistics involved in securing a placement.It seems entirely to be for bragging rights as much as anything. But boasting about \"good schools\" is the most base endeavour, along with taking pride in your schools place on the list.Schools that top the league table have low levels of deprivation. The have high levels of children with middle class, engaged parents private tutors their young people are less likely to face the barrage of challenges that confront teenagers in the schools at the other end of the table.Its gauche, taking delight in your schools place in the charts. Its a front for boasting about your own material success in le. Well done.Even with a signicant amount of contextual padding round the sides, ranking schools from \"best to worst\" is nothing but an insult to the majority of schools there - and it tells you very little of value.The phrase \"good school\" should come with a mandatory prison term for anyone who utters it sincerely.Lets not even get in to the complex issue of using five plus awards at SCQF Level . All Highers are at SCQF Level , but not all qualications at that level are Highers so the league tables become squfier still.This year, for the Glasgow Times, we didnt produce league tables. We took the same decision last year too. Firstly, during the pandemic, it would have been a particularly slight to rank schools on such a narrow measure when they were adapting to extreme circumstances.Now, a year on, given everything schools, teachers and pupils have endured over the past  months, it would feel like a sucker punch.Thats not to say the performance of schools shouldnt be rigorously examined by journalists and failures highlighted. Thats not what league tables are for, though.They exist for the gratication of middle class parents and as an affront to everyone .Recently I wrote about Lochend Community High School in the east end of Glasgow.Lochend is ordinarily at the bottom of the league table, three Highers or five Highers, it makes no odds. In this weeks tables it sits in the \"worst\" five schools.This year, though, the school has become the first in Scotland to have every pupil move on to a positive leaver destination. Thats  per cent of them.By that metric, its head teacher told me, Lochend should be the best school in the country. One of those positive leaver destinations is that of -year-old Rachel Macrae.Shes the first in her school to gain  Highers and the first to gain a place at an American university. She wants to study forensic science and perhaps join the FBI.Like Rachel, my ambition at school was the join the FBI but it was a dream developed due to an obsession with The X Files rather than anything based on wit, endeavour or talent.Rachel, who has all three, has future success hinging on whether she finds enough funding to help her pay for her tuition fees and living expenses. Perhapsshe went to a school at the top of the league tables she wouldnt have to have launched a Crowdfunder and be reliant on the kindness of strangers to fulfill her dream.On the issue of positive leaver destinations, another head teacher I spoke to said his school would have hit  per cent also, but one of the pupils, they felt, could move on to something better than what he had chosen.So, instead of pushing him one way in order to hit that magical round number, the school let itself come second in order to put its pupil first.Thats the mantra of teachers up and down the country though, isnt it  Putting themselves second in order to ensure their pupils come first.What a slap in the face these league tables must be, particularly now.Schools have been feeding pupils, providing care for them, going above and beyond every week. Theyve been trying to navigate the vagaries of the SQAs exams balls up last year and the opaque exams-that-arent-exams system this year. And on and on.You cant fit any of these things easily into raw data, they dont slide well into columns on a table.Five plus Highers is such an outdated measure of achievement. Absolutely, pupils who work hard and earn their qualications should be proud. Those who choose to take a dferent path, into an apprenticeship or work or college are no less successful than their peers who go to university.Theres a strong case to be made that positive leaver destinations are the more insightful metric, not that Im suggesting an alternative table.Who benefits from the rankings  No one. Who is harmed by them  Teachers and pupils.Next year how about they quietly die a death, a relic from less enlightened times."},{"url":null,"title":"kenmure-street-nicola-sturgeon-says-home-office-must-ask-hard-questions","story":"Police Scotland released the two Indian nationals detained by Border Force officials in the city after people surrounded their van and prevented it from leaving on Thursday.Demonstrators in Kenmure Street, Pollokshields, had blocked the immigration enforcement van for hours, with one lying underneath the vehicle.Around  protesters were at the scene, with chants of ldquoLeave our neighbours, let them go and ldquoCops go home being heard as a ring of police stood around the van.:Glasgow locals protest deportation at Pollokshields streetIn response to the scenes, the First Minister tweeted: ldquoThe Home Office needs to ask itself hard questions after today.ldquoDoing this on Eid, in the heart of our Muslim community, and in the midst of a serious Covid outbreak was staggeringly irresponsible ndash but the even deeper problem is an appalling asylum  immigration policy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Kenmure Street\",\"description\": \"Deportation protest\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media XYtikkgB poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests XYtikkgB.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": It is understood neither of the men is Muslim.Shortly after pm, Police Scotland released a statement saying the men would be released to protect public safety.Chief Superintendent Mark Sutherland added: ldquoPolice Scotland has, following a suitable risk assessment, taken the operational decision to release the men detained by UK Immigration Enforcement back into their community meantime.The Home Office needs to ask itself hard questions after today.

It began on Monday with a plea from reader Andrew Turnbull for Gaelic to be brought back into public le. He added: ldquoWhy should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names . I decided to illustrate the point with a picture from our files of a bilingual road sign. As fate would have it, I chose Auchinleck, or Achadh nan Leac. And thatrsquos where the trouble began.On Tuesday, Celia Judge retorted that the widespread use of Gaelic was a politically correct gesture, adding that Auchinleck is ldquoa town in the west of Scotland where Gaelic was not spoken and is as foreign a tongue to the locals as Romanian or Chinese. On Wednesday, we had a slew of responses affirming that Gaelic was once widely spoken in the area, with evidence going back as far as the th century. Doug Maughan wrote: ldquoIf we donrsquot use Gaelic and our dialects, they will die out or become museum pieces.There are areas of reporting where we do use the Gaelic. We wouldnrsquot dream of translating Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is now widely used it is becoming almost as familiar as Western Isles Council. Why not, then, say Na h-Eileanan for the area the local authority represents  After all, we have no qualms when it comes to munros: Aonach Mograver and Buachaille Etive Mograver, for example, may not trip off the tongue, but theyrsquore familiar to many. And The Herald reported last September on the growing campaign to change Fort William to An Gearasdan.That chimes with a theme in Mr Maughanrsquos letter: ldquoWe have no right to disrespect other cultures by disregarding their languages and names, he wrote, giving as an example Mount Everest: should it revert to being Nepali Sagarmatha or Tibetan Chomolungma He actually raises a fair point. There are many place names that we no longer anglicise as a matter of course. I used to harbour an ambition to visit Ayers Rock, now itrsquos Uluru.We donrsquot talk about Bombay any more, itrsquos Mumbai. Beijing, not Peking.But how far should we go  Itrsquos one thing to abandon colonial names that were used because we wanted them to sound British. That is as it should be. But sometimes, for a while at least, new usages cause confusion.

In regards to food supply issues, it could be used as an effective tool to predict what will happen in areas hit by climate change by showing the effects of growing dferent crops and using dferent techniques.As well as improving the resilience of crops, it could also help reduce pesticide use ndash improving the impact on the environment as well as increasing yields. Carbon emissions could also be reduced by accurately modelling how dferent crops could be grown effectively in dferent places so they are harvested nearer local markets, decreasing the need for transport.This digital twin would be a ldquogame-changer according to Jaime Reed, CGIrsquos vice president of space data s and applications in the UK. ldquoPeople have dreamed of modelling these really big, tricky problems for years and now, because of the computing power that is available, we are finally on the verge of being able to do it which is exciting, he said.ldquoWe hear a lot of negative things about companies using data for advertising and so on but we can take a lot of that technology and use it to make tangible dferences to peoplersquos lives.He said CGIrsquos digital twin was intended to be a proof of concept, to see whether it could be done. ldquoItrsquos a really good idea but it is a very big challenge, he said.ldquoNothing like this has ever been done before other than weather forecasting, which has taken  years using computers to get to where we are today. Everybody thinks it is feasible but we need to prove it so this project is really on that cutting edge to show it is possible.CGI will build the precursor using its digital data  technology incorporating Articial Intelligencetechniques. A model integration will bring together multiple data sets, including socio-economic and physical measurements to demonstrate how powerful these advanced technologies can be for solving todayrsquos most pressing challenges.The precursor will be developed by an industrial and scientic team including Oxford University Innovation, Trillium and IIASA. A wide ranging stakeholder group of scientists and users will support the precursor to ensure it is truly state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose and will build momentum towards ground-breaking digital innovation in Europe.Reed said it took ldquoa lot of hard work to win the project but there is now a first class team working on it, including stakeholders who could provide valuable input on the kind of problems they would like solved.ldquoThe aim is to build something that is useful, so that is why we need to have the stakeholders guiding us, he said. ldquoThere is a strong academic link there as well so it is really about the community coming together to deliver a game changer.CGI has, in fact, been delivering complex, mission-critical space software systems for clients across Europe, Asia and North America supporting satellite navigation, communications and operations, to space enabled applications for over  years.Reed said: ldquoThis builds on all the heritage we have in this area as we have been doing this kind of thing for quite a long time.The prototype will use satellite data that monitors crops and combines it with data on weather, climate and population movement and growth to produce holistic modelling.An example of how it would work would be to provide predictions of what will happen as a result of the UK changing its way of managing crops now that it has left the EU.ldquoThe aim is now to improve bioersity which is a big policy change but nobody really knows what is going to happen because there are no integrated simulation systems at present, Reed said. Modelling of crop production in climate stressed areas would be of interest to aid agencies, the World Bank and the UN, he pointed out.ldquoOne of the problems at the moment is that it is quite hard to evaluate what the solutions are because everything is done quite experimentally, said Reed.The Digital Twin Earth would be able to run through dferent scenarios to see what would work best in order to make more informed decisions on food production.Gordon Campbell at ESA said: lsquolsquoThis is an extremely challenging development activity, linking erse analysis capabilities to provide a step change in the information available to decision makers in domains such as food security, protecting ecosystems and bioersity, planning energy production and managing resource utilisation within the framework of the European Green Deal. The range of competencies within the team is well suited to addressing this challenge and developing a prototype system to enable target stakeholders to explore the opportunities afforded by these new analysis tools.Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI added: ldquoWe are excited to be part of the ESA Digital Twin Earth programme which will enable the scientic community to better understand the environmental changes impacting our global food supply. This project builds on our ongoing support to the European Space Agency and Thematic Exploitation Platforms.------------------------------------------------------High hopes of creating a better worldData gathering advances may not only assist with global food shortages but also improve climate change predictionsACCURATE data will be essential to enable the Digital Twin Earth to produce valid and precise modelling of the results of climate change and weather patterns on food production.Much of this data will be gleaned from the satellites that orbit the planet, monitoring its climate and weather.These observations could now be made much more accurate by a new project which also involves CGI.Called TRUTHS, it is a UK-led mission, designed to improve Earth observation data in order to drive improved climate change modelling.It is intended to increase the ability for climate benchmarking and satellite cross-calibration, enabling a metrology laboratory in space as well as providing measurements of the solar spectrum to address scientic questions.It is being led by Airbus in the UK and involves the UK Space Agencyand other ESA member states and will be delivered by the European Space Agencyto enable in-flight calibration of Earth Observationsatellites.If successful, it will help deliver improved confidence in Earth observation data gathered from space and the critical forecasts provided by this data.CGIrsquos role is to define the Payload Data Ground Systemfor the Traceable Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studiessatellite.ldquoAccuracy of data is vital in helping scientists understand the impact of climate change and we are proud to be supporting this mission with our strong heritage of ground segment control and space data exploitation, said Shaun Stretton, Senior Vice President for UK  Australia Space Control and Information Solutions at CGI."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : amBy Patricia Long Thanks to the internet, it is now possible to put together stories of how Orcadians have influenced the wider world.

This is an extended version of one of them.Michael Faraday was one of the world’s greatest scientists.He was also one of the first to recognise the importance of reaching a wider audience and he had the perfect venue for this, at the Royal Institution in London. The lecture theatre there is probably the most famous in the world, thanks to the Christmas Lectures he began in , which have been televised since . It was designed by an Orcadian, Thomas Webster.Thomas’s father Alexander was English, but his mother Mary was the daughter of Thomas Baikie, the minister at St Magnus Cathedral, and Thomas grew up in Orkney.According to his entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he attended Kirkwall Grammar School, and then went to Aberdeen University in , where “he assisted Professor Patrick Copland, a populariser of science.” Professor Copland was a pioneer of public education, whose extramural classes ran from  to . He also pioneered the use of demonstrations in his lectures, so Thomas may have taken a few new ideas with him when he went to London.Thomas Webster enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London as an architectural student in , and had his own business by . He began “a school for mechanics,” and this came to the attention of Count Rumford, one of the founders of what became the Royal Institution. Rumford’s aim was to encourage the use of mechanical inventions and improvements, and to encourage “the Application of Science to the Common Purposes of Le.”At the age of , Webster was engaged as treasurer and secretary of the Institution and, as Clerk of Works, superintended the transformation of a house into a suitable building. In January , he was told to prepare plans for a new lecture room. Many years later he wrote:The theatre of the Royal Institution is pronounced to be the most perfect room of the kind in the kingdom for possessing the properties of allowing the lecturer to be well heard and seen by the audience and for affording them easy entrance and exit, c . . . it has been stated by Faraday, in his late examination before a committee of the House of Commons, to be ‘almost perfect as a lecture room,’ and that ‘although architects are continually measuring and drawing it to copy from, and many other rooms have been built in imitation of it in which he has tried his voice, yet none of them proved equal to that in question.Sir Humphrey Davy was the first scientist to draw crowds to the lecture theatre, which could seat  people. He also made good use of the laboratory which Thomas Webster had installed, using electrolysis to discover sodium and potassium. Webster wrote later: “The chemical laboratory in which so many valuable discoveries have been made was not only designed and built by me, but owes to me its very existence, for, though I inserted it in my plans, the managers did not at first consider it necessary.”Count Rumford had assured Webster that he was going to establish a science school for workmen and, as he wrote to a friend:It was through the prospect of being employed in this way, which would have been as agreeable to my habits of thinking as useful to my interest, that I was induced to give up the school which I then kept and the other business in which I was engaged, and to accept of a situation and salary in the Institution by no means equivalent to what I should have considered myself as entitled to under other circumstances.Eighty years before compulsory education, he had found that new techniques in building needed better-educated workmen.Knowing from previous experience what it was possible to effect in their improvement, I conceived the idea of giving to mechanics for this purpose a species of scientic education suited to their condition, and I believe I was the first person in this country who took active steps for effecting so desirable an object. I was not unacquainted with the political feelings of that time, but I did not think a little learning was a dangerous thingjudiciously bestowed . . . My idea was to make good mechanics, not to force them like hot-bed plants out of the sphere in which they are so useful.Webster succeeded in convincing the managers that the school was a good idea. News of the school was published, and was very well received. Sadly, after all the preparations were made, ideas changed.I was asked rudely what I meant by instructing the lower classes in science. I was told likewise that it was resolved upon that the plan must be dropped as quietly as possible. It was thought to have a dangerous political tendency, and I was told thatI persisted, I would become a marked man!Webster decided to leave the institution and embark on another career, as a landscape artist.This somehow led to work on textbooks and a commission in , to draw one of the first geological maps of England. Geology was a very new science the Geological Society had only been founded in . Sir Henry Englefield, President of the Society, commissioned Webster to survey and draw the geology of the Isle of Wight. This was published in .Ten years later, Webster became the secretary of the Geological Society and curator of its museum. Soon, he was back at the Royal Institution.Notices of lecture courses in the s include Faraday on chemistry and Webster on geology. He gave the Christmas Lectures, “suitable for a juvenile auditory,” in .University College London was founded in , and Webster became its first professor of geology in .He is described as the first professional geologist, because it was then still seen as a gentleman’s hobby. Unfortunately, this meant that he was poorly paid and, although he was awarded a government pension of £ a year for services to geology, he had to find other sources of income.For the last ten years of his le, he worked on a commission from Longmans Publishing. The enormous  Encyclopedia of Domestic Economy brought together all “the information useful to persons who have to superintend domestic establishments.” It begins with where to build your house, and goes on to cover everything from the dferent options for heat and light to the preparation of every sort of beverage, from gin to coffee.It is now well known that Isabella Beeton stole material shamelessly for her Book of Household Management, published in .Her main source was Webster’s Encyclopedia: on the Arrangement of the Kitchen and General Observations, on beverages, bread, etc. Thomas Webster was unable to complain about her plagiarism.He had died aged  in December . He was a man ahead of his time, so got neither the payment nor recognition that he deserved but his writing, though uncredited, has stood on more bookshelves than all other Orcadian writers put together.Mrs Beeton’s Cookbook sold two million copies in its first decade alone.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Simply because until you have planning permission you don’t have a product.“And the market moves, so a figure now could be out of date in six month’s time. I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Before there was a space available for her I was away in college and my mother had to care for my grandmother as dementia caused her to become increasingly dficult to look after.“My mother had very little free time as she had to look after my younger siblings, manage the croft, work five days a week and care for my grandmother.

The consultation with the local community where most expressed a wish to have separate buildings for dferent local services appears to have been ignored by the decision makers in the comhairle and the Scottish Government.”One petitioner, known as Jeanne C, stated on the  degrees website: “Nothing about this ugly hub is right and there has been insufficient representation from Barra. All facilities will be smaller – with Covid distancing  We will have no care home and Eoligarry [Primary] School will be closed.“The comhairle is spending millions on decanting pupils instead of building the new school just near the old one.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1620825021322.jpg--covid_19___wed_12th_may_figures.jpg?1620825021000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210512newscovid 19 wed 12th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

It truly is a wonderful place and there is nowhere  Id rather be at this stage of Jessicas Journey.”Jessica also asked her mum to share pictures of her with her frame on, saying it will give people the chance to see what she looks like now.Mum Julie recalls the day of surgery, describing it a “bit of a blur” for her.“The Team came to the Ward to see me. Professor Dunaway, the lead surgeon, was smiling, they all were. He said they were finished and all went exceptionally well. I sobbed, happy tears, tears of sheer relief that it was over. He went on to say that there had been absolutely no complications. In fact Jessica had sailed through the surgery. She hadnt even needed a blood transfusion which is almost always a given with this type of surgery. The team advised that it would be another two hours before Jessica would be in recovery.”Julie said those last two hours “were definitely the longest of the day.”“Around pm the nurse took me to recovery, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see. Jessica bruised, swollen and had wires, tubes and drains everywhere. But there in the middle of it all her little voice said Mummy can I have something to eat,” recalled Julie.Mum explained that over the next seven days they had “good days and not so good days.”“But the staff on the High Dependency Ward were nothing short of amazing. They looked after me as much as they looked after Jessica. They actually made us feel like we were the only family on the ward, They are very special people who go above and beyond every day for families like ours.”Jessica has amazed staff, surgeons and family with her recovery.On Day  Professor Dunaway told Julie in his entire career he has never seen a recovery like it, describing it as “amazing.”“I replied Our God is amazing, it really has been nothing short of a miracle,” said Julie.As the week progressed the Surgical Team gradually informed Julie of what they had done in theatre.They explained that because Jessica was coping so well under the anaesthetic, they decided to do a little bit extra to ensure that Jessica had the best possible outcome from the surgery.“They didnt just fit the frame as planned, they bone grafted her a new nose, they gave her a cheek lt and plated her forehead. So, in light of all of this it made her recovery even more of a miracle,” smiled Julie“It also re-iterated to me that these surgeons are very special people, who go above and beyond on a daily basis for children like Jessica. They want the very best for them and they will do everything in their power to improve their quality of le. Thank you just doesnt go far enough, we will be eternally grateful to that Team.”Husband Lawrie was able to join Jessica and Julie for the weekend - “to help us with the move”, quipped Julie.“We’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of ‘stuff’ over the last seven days, but it was horrible having to say goodbye.”Julie reports that Jessica has started to eat and drink more orally so not requiring as many tube feeds, swelling is going down gradually and continuing to improve daily!Regarding her frame, the screws will be turned twice a day for the next few weeks, gradually changing the shape of Jessica’s face.Mum Julie is always very mindful to thank all those who have sent texts, cards gts and prayed for them.“It has been absolutely amazing and were so thankful to have the first week done with no major complications. As someone said to me ‘first week done , a road never to be traveled again’.“It was tough, there were tears . There were good days, there were not so good days but we’ve done it and know that God was with us and will continue to be with us in the days and weeks ahead,” said Julie.And Julie makes no secret of the fact that faith has got her through this very challenging time.“Obviously our faith has been a major factor in how we, as a family, have been able to cope with all of this. And the outpouring of prayer, practical and emotional support from our own church, Ballyloughan Presbyterian, Connor Presbyterian where Jessica attends GB and Youth Club and Woodlands Presbyterian in Carrick who have adopted us, along with many other churches and iniduals from every denomination has been special. And we would like to thank everyone whos been praying and offering practical support, it has meant so much to us and it has been wonderful to see so many people being the church.”Julie said they had every faith in the Surgical Team, and “and more importantly we knew that Jessica and that team were covered in prayer leading up to and for the duration of the surgery. Churches of all denominations, iniduals and groups of people from all faiths had prayer rotas going throughout the day, and so we had a peace about this surgery from the outset.”Indeed, a verse of scripture that was very poignant in the week leading up to this surgery was Isaiah : -  So do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God, I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.“This verse was in my head as I walked out of the anaesthetic room that morning, it was the most dficult thing I have ever had to do. But I knew that God was in complete control and would carry Jessica, the team and me through that day and in the days to come,”said Julie.The Jessicas Journey Facebook and Instagram pages have been a real source of encouragement to them as a family over the last couple of weeks.“We currently have .K followers and so I think we have achieved our aim of raising awareness of Craniofacial conditions. The comments, well wishes, prayers and support of thousands of people on the page have carried us through the dark days - thank you to each and every person whos taken the time to comment or message, you really have made a dference and you have restored our faith in humanity,” concluded Julie.

Chair of DTUC, Niall McCarroll, says that as a working class movement DTUC has provided a voice for workers and social justice campaigns. It aims to further reach out with the launch of a local workers survey, as it extends its solidarity with the people of Derry and District demanding an end to the many hardships which workers and their families experience and have experienced for far too long. Mr McCarroll says: Like everyone  I have listened to plenty of guff over the years. Hang in there is the message from all sections of the establishment, we are sympathetic and very empathetic we know things are dficult butyou keep working for nothing with no improvements things will improve. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, hotel workers, health care assistants, nursing home workers, shop workers, classroom assistants, retail workers, community, voluntary sector workers and indeed call centre staff have all heard this and still they wait, we all wait. We need to organise and begin to direct our own affairs, we need to represent ourselves because we are not being represented. He adds: Derry Trades Union Council call upon all local workers to join a trade union, get active in your local branch and shape your trade union into a fighting, working class organisation. This is how we will change our lives make our communities better, create a culture of solidarity across all workplaces, uniting all workers. Lets begin to create this new modern workers movement. googletag.cmd.push Unionised workers of the past, including our local factory workers championed the cause of labour and won many of the rights we take for granted today such as maternity pay,  hour days and weekends off. Todays demands are not being won, workers need decent pay and we must collectively mobilise to end the scourge of poverty pay, creating the situation were no worker needs to work two jobs to survive. By completing the DTUC survey we can commence the call to mobilise, use this survey to bring us together - together we can make a dference - together we can deliver for each other.     We are told by the privileged few that we must wait to gain the same privileges. Time is up.

This year more than ever, it is important to celebrate the incredible contributions that nurses make to our society. One such inidual who deserves a special mention is Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist Margaret Carlin who was named Cancer Nurse of the Year  at the Royal College of Nursing Awards NI. Margaret is from Magherafelt and is based at Antrim Area Hospital. She has been caring for local people for almost  years and has just retired from her full-time post. googletag.cmd.push Margaret took up her role as a Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialist in the Mid Ulster Hospital in . “My post was created as a result of collaboration between Macmillan Cancer Support and what is now the Northern Health and Social Care Trust,” recalls Margaret. “It was important to have a full-time nurse specialist who could provide expert advice, support and information to patients who were living with cancer or a le limiting illness.” Following Margaret’s appointment, her sterling work in the community was well known. Funds, however, were needed to continue to support her role and this inspired a group of iniduals in the Magherafelt area to form a fundraising committee. googletag.cmd.push In their time, Magherafelt Fundraising Committee raised over pound,, pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support in Northern Ireland. “Over the years I have met and cared for many people with cancer and other le limiting conditions, often at times of great distress for them, their families and loved ones,” explains Margaret. “They have allowed me into their lives and to be with them throughout their illness. They have shared their thoughts and feelings with me and told me about their hopes and fears for the future. We laughed together and sometimes we cried together. “Throughout the years, I continue to meet people who I met at the time when they were diagnosed with cancer.     “I am always glad to see them and it makes me really happy to see the quality of le they continue to have. I also meet many families whose loved ones I cared for, who sadly have died, and I am always touched that they remember me and the times we spent together. “They tell me about their lives now and changes there have been. “They tell me how their children and grandchildren have grown up and are doing well and this reminds me that I will always be part of their memories and how privileged I am to be a Macmillan nurse.” Margaret initially trained as a nursing student in Mid Ulster Hospital from - and following this worked as a staff nurse in the Mid Ulster Hospital. It was in October  that she became a Macmillan nurse, delivering chemotherapy to patients as well as helping to set up and establish palliative care services. In , Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital as Macmillan Lung Cancer Nurse Specialist. “Since Margaret moved to Antrim Area Hospital, she has worked tirelessly to raise the standards of the care delivered to patients diagnosed with lung cancer,” explains Sally Convery, Macmillan Service Lead for Palliative Care. “Margaret is passionate about caring for the inidual and is very focused on ensuring patients are recognised as people and not by their diagnosis. “She encourages them to focus on the positive aspects of le and not on their diagnosis. Margaret is an excellent role model to the other lung cancer nurses and demonstrates her passion for ensuring safe and effective care. “She continually strives to improve the patient’s quality of le and has shown outstanding commitment to the creation and delivery of a pulmonary prehabilitation self-management programme for patients with lung cancer. “Margaret believes it is important services are delivered with patients and relatives at the forefront and because of this she is involved in and promotes ious lung cancer support groups in the area as well as co-ordinating a support group that is regularly reviewed by patients. “As well as this, she has driven forward a campaign to increase the awareness of lung cancer symptoms and has lead a team of her colleagues to visit local shopping centres and share leaflets ensuring members of the public are aware of the signs and symptoms of lung cancer. She is always looking at ways to get the message out there in innovative ways.” Sally continued: “Margaret is a wonderful resource of expert knowledge and she has certainly shown outstanding leadership in cancer and palliative care for almost  years’ service. “We are delighted that she has agreed tofor a short time following her retirement to ensure the service continues to deliver high quality care and we wish her the very best in her future, we will miss her.” Margaret concluded: “Although I have officially retired from my full-time post, I will continue in my role as a Macmillan lung cancer nurse specialist two days a week for another year. “I will really miss my colleagues and all the people that I have met and cared for over the years.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

News of Down trailing in Cork filtered through to Brewster Park where Carlus McWilliams stoppage time point grabbed victory. But it wasnt enough. Jerome Johnston saved Down with a thminute equaliser. Derrys inferior score dference saw them drop below Clare and Down, to the drop zone, and out of the top half of Irelands football rankings. Of the six teams in Division  that weekend, Dublin, Kerry, Donegal, Tyrone and Monaghan remain there.

In the distance, Fermanagh and Ulster champions Cavan come down the tracks, but Saturdays trip to Longford will tell a lot in a -day period that will define Derrys season. Mention Longford to any Derry fan, and it will generate that sickening feeling in the pit of their stomach. Digging deeper, since the turn of the millennium, the sides have played eight times in league and championship, with Derry winning three of them. Of the five Derry played on their travels, you have to go back to a  All-Ireland series for their only win. It was a day when current Longford manager Padraic Davis kicked six points, as Derry hammered them in just the second year of the qualiers, thanks to two Anthony Tohill goals. googletag.cmd.push More recently Derry tanked them at Celtic Park last year, but they were without experienced trioMichael Quinn, Barry McKeon and David McGivney.

Of the current squad, only newcomers Conleth McShane and his Bellaghy teammate Ronan McFaul have yet to make their debut. The championship will take care of itself when it comes around. Before that, its hard to imagine it even being discussed in the group. Getting off to a winning start is the only show in town. Momentum is sports most useful tool. With it, so much of everything  follows. Derry are well-placed. Having almost everyone fit for selection is one plus. The squad are in tip top shape and there has to be positives from elements of the Armagh performance in last years championship. Defensively, there are vast improvements to be made. With McKinless in the mix and with Karl McKaigue ing, it will create more competition and with it, the standards will rise. Thats the first improvement. Those early exchanges left Armagh playing the game on their own terms. Any shot Longford get away this weekend, will need to be under more than token pressure. Longford have only failed to hit the net in six of the  games under Padraic Davis in the last two seasons. Secondly, getting a medium to long-range kick-out option is another thing Derry need to find. Working the ball out short is okay to an extent, but it is energy sapping and doesnt ask enough questions of the opposition. Half the Derry squad come from Glen , Slaughtneiland Magherafelt , teams with their goalkeepers going short more often than not. A more ied Derry at midfield, will give them so many more options up front. This is where many of the gains are to be had, but it plonks responsibility on Emmett Bradley and the untested Conor Glass. Yes, the former minor captain was a professional athlete, but he has been away from the game for the last five years. Thirdly, in attack, Shane McGuigan is the star of the show and getting him a regular wing-man up front is a must. If Derry can improve in these three areas, they can go one better than last season and gain promotion. But it will be far from easy.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With new movie Stealth due to premiere before the end of this month, the company is currently working on Grief, a film detailing the pain and loss caused by the Covid- pandemic. The second instalment of Long Shot, entitled Long Shot’s Letter, is also due for completion. After Grief is shot and edited by mid-June, its on to West Banksy which will deal with drug addiction and abuse. googletag.cmd.push The groups alternative news programme, It’s News To Me, will be launched in September and it is hoped three more short films by the end of the year, one of which will focus on bullying in the secondary sector. Joseph McCarthy, writer, director and producer with Black North, which he founded, said: “We have already sourced school ties and shirts and will need to source jumpers, trousers and skirts too. “In between times, we will complete the third part of our Troubles’ Trilogy, so we will be very busy for some time. We will also be casting for new members when the lockdown lts.” googletag.cmd.push Joseph said Black North Productions was formed to get the message out there that the North of Ireland is not a place to avoid, not a place of hate and despair. He added: “The North of Ireland is a beautul place, populated by friendly people who have been trapped by history that is not of our making. We aim to show the positive aspects of Northern Ireland, that is second to no other place in artistic talent.” Joe explained how Black North came into being. “We came about due to a marked lack of opportunity for people who had artistic ability, but in essence no real outlet. I began writing poetry and plays some years ago and I wrongly assumed that long established arts venues would nurture new talent.     “A good example of this was when I tried to get one of my plays performed in the city. I approached the then chief executive of that venue and spoke with a  of their governing body regarding getting some assistance to have my play produced. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there was an insular attitude and mercenary outlook, which left me both surprised and disappointed. “Needless to say, I have had no contact with either that venue or those art experts since. It’s interesting to note, that the play I approached them with which was called Enough is Enough won the University of Ulster’s Greer Garson Award for Theatre soon after that meeting. I formed the impression that I was being grilled on that occasion and that in itself, was an unpleasant experience. “I came up with idea of forming Black North Productions and at that particular time, the North of Ireland was being avoided by many people from the Republic of Ireland and the UK. The Nordies were cast in a dark light that we simply did not deserve to be in that position. I set out to show that we in the North, and in particular our city, can produce poetry, plays and short films that can be deemed as artistic works of the highest quality. “There was never any formal meeting or expressions of interest highlighted at that time. I came up with idea, developed the idea, enlisted the help of others who were of the same mind-set, both regarding the attitudes of outsiders to the North of Ireland and the dismal lack of assistance that prevailed in the city and unfortunately still does to a large extent.” Black Norths first film was Wish You Were Here. Joe explained its storyline: “It revolved around a writer played by Greta McTeague, who whilst writing a detective novel gets, side-tracked by the historic events that have happened in the city. The film opens in  and in her mind she imagines she is speaking with the people from that time. The central character is the likeable and fair- minded Michael Quinlivan. I intended to produce a Trouble’s Trilogy moving from  to  and then to present day. “The theme was in essence about the Trouble’s children, who lived through that period, suffered so much and yet seamlessly formed bonds with total strangers who shared the same experiences and through those experience formed bonds that still exist today.” To date, Black North has made six films – as well as Wish You Were Here, there has been Right Reasons For Wrong, Long Shot, F-, Unlucky Lucky and andSnowflake Generation. Joseph added: “We will premiere Stealth by the end of the month and have quite a lot of work completed on our final Troubles film, Half Ticket No Return. but due to such a large cast and the urrent restrictions, we have had to put that one onhold.” Joseph said Stealth was a really interesting piece. He added: “It is set in both present day and the future and shows our technical abilities and innovations through an intriguing storyline that will make people sit up and think. It is very much an Orwellian piece with a modern twist.” Black North is currently working on Grief, telling the story of loss due to the pandemic. Joe said it came about for a number of reasons. He added: “Having known so many people who have lost loved ones and listened to their heart-wrenching stories of not getting to say that final goodbye, or to be there when they felt they were most needed, made me feel that there needs to be some kind of closure. A chance to say that final farewell.” Joseph conceded the films topic was dficult topic to deal with it. He said: “As we all know, Covid- has had a devastating effect on so many people and has brought entire countries to a standstill. “It was a dficult topic to deal with in a sensitive and constructive way, I have done my best to alleviate the sense of loss and hurt that this terrible virus has caused. “I really hope that we, as a team, have done that. From our extras, who will play mourners, to the bikers who will escort the coffin into the city, to our choir and central characters played by Jamie Coll, Chantel Carlin, Gabriel White, Kieran Dallas, Corey Hanna and Dean O’Donnell, I really hope we have.” So, how did the bikers become involved  Joseph explained: “Gerry McGeady, a leading light with Centurions MC, is the main man when it came to organising bikers. “Gerry is a well-respected biker of many years and has strong connections to the world of bikers and, in particular, the local clubs. “I have to thank him for all his efforts in bringing together a dedicated bunch of bikers in the form of The Exiles RC and The Centurions MCC. “The bikers are a great team to work with and they are keen to become involved in Grief as they too understand the immense sense of loss felt by so many people.” Joseph said Black Norths was very proud of its wide range of cast members. He said: “The pandemic has made casting for parts very dficult for us, but we have done our best to continue to bring in new members and Grief will comprise of several new member and a younger cast. “Quite often, a member will suggest a family member who would suit a part or a friend or relative and once we give that person a piece to perform and have a chat with him her, we then film them and take it from there. “We are proud of our wide and ied cast members. “We have people from all backgrounds such as: bricklayers, plasterers, council workers, accountants, health care workers, secondary school pupils, students, basically from every walk of le. “Some people were hesitant and lacked confidence, those same people are now much more confident and outgoing. “Indeed, this has been one of greatest achievements to date, to see people develop and grow in confidence, people who would never have had an opportunity to become involved in film.”                                         --  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions.

Jade Bradley, who is originally from Hatmore Park in the Foyle Springs area of the city, is the founder of Restore Nutrition, a wellness company that specialises in helping people with their nutrition to deliver a better quality of le. Jade embarked on her own mental and physical health journey several years ago having struggled with anxiety. She used a blended approach which included yoga, meditation, music, therapy and the input from a kinesiologist that advised on food issues and intolerances. googletag.cmd.push Within two months of implementing these changes, Jade saw a massive change resulting in better sleep, more energy and a feeling of being more ‘restored.’ It was this that sparked her desire to educate herself in naturopathic nutrition. She moved to London and studied at the College of Naturopathic Medicine and became a member of the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council. She launched Restore Nutrition in  and the company has since gone from strength to strength. working with over  private clients and organisations including, Seagate, Business in the Community, Hurt, Waterside Neighbourhood Partnership, Belfast Food Network, Hillcrest, Culmore Hub, Foyle Women’s Information Group, Derry Well Woman and Youth Action. googletag.cmd.push Speaking about her new programme, Jade said: “We are living in a stressed out society, and having the main pillars of health and wellbeing in place is essential to help deal with stress and anxiety. If the fundamentals aren’t in place, it is impossible for us to excel.” Jade said these fundamentals were more important than ever given the challenging times we are all in. She added: “I centre our work around four pillars which we delve into on the ‘Kick Start’ programme namely: hydration, reducing toxic load, restoring with whole foods and managing stress and sleep.” She said she has found most people want a quick fix or a magic pill when it came to their health and wellbeing journey.     “Unfortunately, this does not exist,” she said. “It is best to make small changes incrementally and embark on this journey in stages starting off with the fundamentals which is exactly what we do in our new programme. “Furthermore, it is so important to tackle mental health issues with an all-round approach and this is why I have worked with local mental health therapist, Caroline McMenamin, on many projects over the past two years and plan to do more collaborations throughout the year.” The ‘Kick Start’ nutrition programme is available for business groups, charities, community groups and inidual attendees and runs over four weeks in one-hour sessions. You can obtain more information, costs and sign up by emailing Jade:info@ restorenutrition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The buildings at  and  Strand Road have been empty since a Boojum restaurant closed last March. Now, as business le in the city slowly restarts after the devastating impact of the pandemic, it has emerged that a new coffee house is to open in the Strand Road buildings which lie at the busy junction with Clarendon Street. Final preparations are being made for the opening of the Industry Deli  Coffee House. The owners of the business say it will be opening soon. googletag.cmd.push This will be seen as a huge boost for business le in the Strand Road area. Before Boojum, the Sandwich Company occupied the Strand Road building for many years. As business le in the city centre slowly s, Brian Tierney, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, has been visiting local shops to offer the councils support. He urged people to shop local as much as possible. I was glad to meet with some of the local businesses across our district this week and hear more about the positive steps forward now that many of those businesses have reopened or are preparing for a scheduled reopening in the coming weeks. googletag.cmd.push It was fantastic to see lots of people supporting those businesses while I was out and about and to see that all of the businesses have measures in place to instill confidence in all members of the public that they can support local and be assured that everything is in place to protect both themselves and staff. I can fully appreciate how much of a challenge the past year has been for our businesses across a wide range of sectors, and I look forward to the weeks ahead when we hope to see more of those sectors reopening and ing to a more normal operation of business,” said the Mayor.     Once again I would just like to encourage everyone to support local across the district as much as you can.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Strong partnership working, sharing information and joined up messaging are key across the North West was the message from the Mayors of Derry City, Strabane and Donegal, attending a meeting to discuss the Covid- response in the region. The meeting this week was co-chaired by the two Mayors, Cllr Brian Tierney Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council and An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey of Donegal County Council It was set up to discuss the cross border approach to the COVID  rates across the North West. googletag.cmd.push It was attended by the Chair and Vice Chair of the North West Regional Development Group, Cllr Sandra Duffyand Cllr Ciaran Brogan , as well as the Chief Executives of Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, John Kelpie and John McLaughlin, along with senior Council officials from both Councils. Those attending the meeting were provided with details of the current Covid- infection rates across their respective Council areas and heard about the proactive work being done by both Councils to support the statutory agencies in responding to the pandemic and how they are adapting services and providing support as the NW reopens at the ying stages of recovery. googletag.cmd.push While concern was expressed at the high infection rate in both Council areas, there was general acknowledgement that compliance was high across the region with the majority of the public adhering to the guidelines and taking all the necessary steps in order to keep each other safe. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Cllr Brian Tierney said the region faced challenges as a result of the iance in the lting of restrictions but that he was confident people on both sides of the border were acting responsibly. He thanked the public for their commitment and support to date urging them to continue to make good decisions.     As the restrictions are lted gradually on both sides of the border, he said it is important everyone continues to act cautiously and adhere to the messages around social distancing, wearing face coverings and regular hand sanitisation. He said: The people of the North West have been amazing throughout this pandemic. They have rallied around one another and supported each other in dficult times. However, its important that we understand that Covid hasnt gone away – its still here and its still spreading. Its still important that we dont let our guard down that we continue to look out for one another. There are small things we can do to protect each other – when we are out walking and see friends we must stand back and keep a distance, when we are going to the shops we must remember to take our face masks and our hand sanitiser and give other customers some space. An Cathaoirleach Cllr Rena Donaghey acknowledged the huge amount of work being done by the two councils, the statutory agencies and health bodies on both sides of the border. She said the strong partnership approach and collaborative work to respond to the Covid- numbers in the region was key in reducing the rate of infection. She said the roll out of the vaccination programmes was hugely positive in providing hope for the future and that all this was good news in providing support to businesses as the Councils work together to rebuild the NW economy. Cllr Donaghey said: We are a region that relies on one another. We have strong family and business connections and our lives are intertwined in everything that we do. It is important therefore in the days ahead and coming weeks and that we avoid attributing blame but work together towards a common goal of protecting our communities from this virus. The people of Donegal, Derry and Strabane are one community, we look out for one another and support one another through thick and thin. Lets continue to do that and work together to keep each other safe so that we can look forward to a better future for all of us. It was agreed at the meeting that the Councils and statutory agencies would continue to share information and work collectively in the weeks and months ahead as the North West region takes small cautious steps towards recovery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Before inter-county football shoehorned the club game into whatever orice it can find, the senior and reserve double header on a Sunday was set in stone across Derry. With cars filtering in the lane from after three oclock, stalwarts would perch themselves along the fence to run their eye over the reserve action. The senior managers ears would often be burning, as some doting Daddies would question their sons non-selection for the seniors. “That man hasnt a clue,” youd sometimes hear. A stellar showing in the reserve game would have you hauled ashore early, to stay fresh for a cameo senior appearance. Some saw it as elevation. The player himself would be frustrated at having his vintage display cut short. googletag.cmd.push Thats the problem with almost being on the senior team. Youre caught between two stools. Everyone  knows where they stand in the pecking order. Johnny must be in the seniors plans,” the auld hands would mumble as he trotted off. He might get five minutes in the senior game. He might get . He might get none. It just depended on how things were going. Thats how it was. If another player on the reserve team, lets call him Paddy, kicked the last two scores, made a goal line block or emptied some man out over the sideline, hed dine off legendary status. googletag.cmd.push “Youd some game Paddy,” somebody would tell him, over the wire, as he pulled on a senior sub jersey. “Youd be starting in the seniors every weekI was over that team.” By the time Paddy pulls up a stool at the bar later that night, and puts manners in his first pint, his bone crunching shoulder challenge has now exaggerated ten times over. “He put yer man through the wire,” would be the latest. And nobody is going to dampen a good story. That was Sunday every week in the club leagues. Tuesday night at training was the time to put in your shout for the senior team next week. And so the cycle continued.     The alternative is playing the reserve game afterwards, with anyone not getting a decentof time in the senior game will get their fill of football. But the self esteem must take an awful battering as almost everyone leaves after the senior game. It depends what your take is. As much as that model served the GAA well, it has its downfall. With the level of preparation at club level going through the roof, the whole weeks diet, rest and social le revolves around the Sunday. Social media went into meltdown last week, with everyone salivating over their Friday night slot for senior games, like Downs tried and tested formula. In theory, it is a great idea. Friday night pints. Saturday and Sunday to take your better half or family out for the day Training on a Monday and Wednesday night, ready to go again. There are two drawbacks. At the height of the Celtic Tiger, with players working in Dublin or further afield, it was a squeeze to get home for a training session at eight oclock, never mind racing home for six oclock to play a reserve game as part of a double header. Secondly, splitting the reserve and senior games to dferent days leaves twice the amount of travel, for the fringe senior players who will be on both squads, while leaving you back where you started with a reserve game on the Sunday. For me, Saturday six oclock and half seven is the answer. It is somewhere in between. It leaves Saturday night free for players to do as they please and get themselves in order for training the following week. The only people it will affect are those who are mixing their GAA with the local soccer or rugby team. But, maybe this is where a compromise needs to be reached. In some places, soccer and rugby keep players fitness ticking over during the off-season. And vice versa. Rather than going loggerheads, clubs could select a certain number of their games for Sunday until the soccer and rugby seasons are over, before moving to Saturday. It wouldnt be every club. In a way, it also gives local GAA clubs an advantage. How many times have you wanted to go and watch the crunch game of the weekend, but cant because you have a game of your own. I always use the example of going to watch Lavey and Ballinderry in a late Sunday evening game. The rest of Derry had the chance to call in on their way home. There was a bumper crowd and an electric atmosphere for players. Everybody is a winner. So of the  games in the Derry A and B leagues, have half on a Sunday, half on a Saturday and one on a Friday night. Set the dates in stone, which gives players six free Sundays they wouldnt normally have had. There is the option of taking your kids to the pool, book a weekend away, nurse a hangover or watch a county game. The licence to do any of those things will make GAA less of a strain on the weekend. The Sunday fixture does suit the supporter, but they arent obliged to go to a game every weekend andthey do, itll take up three hours at the most. Players are dferent. Theyll dedicate Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, with all the sacrices they make in between. Their voice should be heard above the rest. Imagine the weekend Paddy would have, living off kicking three points to win the reserve game and pummelling the oppositions hatchet man in the process.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Even so, he was also at pains to point out that he was not attacking the minister.ldquoThere are numerous issues regarding the Downe and Daisy Hill that need to be dealt with face to face with the minister, he said.ldquoWe have engaged with health trusts until we are blue in the face and we are getting nowhere. We need to put it up to the minister. We are in unprecedented times.Downpatrick councillor Oonagh Hanlon said she too was disappointed and urged Mr Swann to reconsider.ldquoThis is such an important issue, she said. ldquoWe are coming out of Covid and we need the restoration of services at the Downe. I am very disappointed, she remarked.Fellow Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin said he acknowledged that Mr Swann was under pressure, but suggested that a virtual meeting could easily be arranged.ldquoThe Downe Hospital is extremely important to the people I represent, he said. ldquoWe need the minister to come out and say he is as passionate about the Downe as we are.His SDLP colleague, John Trainor, said the council needed to ldquoexplore every avenue, adding that councillors should ask the Stormont Health Committee to interveneMr Swann was to refuse to meet then a second time.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who nursed in a Covid unit at the height of the pandemic, said she wished to ldquoput on record her disappointment.She added: Knowing how important these two hospitals are and having worked in them, it was a weak response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-45m.jpg","title":"£45m investment needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour  ","story":"INVESTMENT in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities, according to a major new report published on Monday.Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots has published the findings of the report which highlights the investment needed in Northern Irelandrsquos fishing industry and seafood sectors.The report was produced by the Fishing and Seafood Development Programmewhich was established by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsto conduct a strategic review of the opportunities for developing the sea fishing and seafood sectors across the province, including the potential role of new public investment in infrastructure.Focusing on recommendations in relation to capital investment at the main fishery harbours, the report highlights a number of challenges and opportunities for the wider industry that could be addressed through a future fisheries financial support scheme.The recommendations for Ardglass include enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses, while the development of Kilkeel harbour as a ldquopotential Irish Sea hub for the fishing and maritime economy by increasing port capacity and shore side facilities is highlighted.More generally, the detailed report highlights the need to create conditions resulting in investment in more modern fuel efficient vessels with low emissions and better facilities for crews, further reducing the environmental impact of the fishing fleet, adopting novel technology to expand marine aquaculture and taking advantage of EU exit opportunities to build exports of high value seafood.The report confirms that a recent survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass revealed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report says there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.A constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically.As a result, the Fishing and Seafood Development Programme proposes a poundm budget to purchase properties and prepare buildings and land within the harbour for redevelopment.With the cost of the work at the main harbour estimated at poundm, the report explains the figure can only be revised following the completion of a bathymetric survey.Ardglass councillor Dermot Curran said he was keen to meet with Mr Poots to discuss the detail of the report and the level of work required.ldquoThe report highlights the development of an lsquoIrish Sea hub in Kilkeel and I know that many in Ardglass will be keen to hear from the minister what exactly this means. Ardglass plays a critical role in the Co Down fishing industry and its contribution to this key sector must be expanded, he said.ldquoThere are two major processing factories in Ardglass and work to dredge the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is a critical component of the investment that is required.Cllr Curran said investment was required to meet the needs of the existing fleet and future vessels.He added: ldquoThe village fleet has increased over the years and those who work in the industry say while they are not necessarily expecting a huge increase in the number of boats, they do anticipate an increase in the quality of boats and for that to happen, the harbour must be fit for purpose.Mr Poots said he hoped the publication of the report ldquomarks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the provincersquos fishing industry.ldquoThe report highlights the considerable investment that is required to help the industry adapt to the challenges it faces and grasp the opportunities presented following the United Kingdomrsquos exit from the EU, he explained.ldquoWe need to build a stronger and more resilient fishing and seafood industry that can adapt to change. Of course, this will not be easy but I hope that with government and industry working together we can build new infrastructure, become more prosperous, improve the marine environment and enhance our reputation as suppliers of quality sustainable seafood.Mr Poots said his department will be engaging with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the report over the next few weeks and hopes that the next phase of work towards harbour investment can proceed shortly.He also confirmed that later in the year DAERA will be consulting on plans for a future fisheries fund to address the wider needs of the fishing industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Cara.jpg","title":"Cara opens first ever Irish Roots festival  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF schoolgirl was honoured at the weekend when she was asked to open the inaugural global Irish Roots online festival.Twelve year-old Cara Mailey is no stranger to appearing in television having appeared in several CBBC programmes over the last two years.However, on Sunday she became a storyteller for the festival which seeks to celebrate Irish people around the world with dferent skin colours.Along with Orla McKeating, the founder of Still I Rise Diversity Storytelling, Cara read two stories mdash Happy in Our Skin and I Am Whole.Both books celebrate dferent skin colours and celebrated the uniqueness of peoplesrsquo skin colours.Cara, who attends Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, was born with achonlasia, a form of dwarfism.She also had the opportunity to share her story, what she likes about her skin and then she also talked about what it was like being dferent to other children her age.Orla also read a third book called the The Little Crayon, a childrenrsquos story book written by -year-old Amelia Kai, also from Belfast.The daughter of Tricia Mailey, a teacher at Cedar Integrated Primary School in Crossgar, Cara has a big personality and has appeared on CBBCrsquos Dengineers and Crafty Party.Tricia said: ldquoCara has read for Still I Rise now for about a year. I think they are amazing. As a teacher myself I think its great to have such books for children showing ersity.Cara inspired a new fashion range earlier this year for girls and teens born with the same condition as her.She hopes to be a spokesperson and campaigner for people with dwarfism in the future.The Irish Roots Festival, created by Tipperary native Lorraine Maher, finishes today.Speaking about the festival, she said: ldquoMixed-race people are one of the fastest growing demographics in the western world, it is crucial to highlight the lives, achievements and struggles of mixed-race Irish people.ldquoThis is a great opportunity to give a shout out globally to those of Irish ancestry regardless of colour or location, she said. ldquoRepresentation is so important for a sense of well-being and belonging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-Developers.jpg","title":"Developers invited to enter bids for redevelopment site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will be asked within the next few weeks to submit their respective bids for the redevelopment of the former Irish Street police base in Downpatrick.The news was confirmed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee on Monday evening.Stretching back as far as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, the proposed development site includes the Irish Street car park and a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base.It is understood that five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand the local authorityThe development brief paves the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site and developers will be given up to  weeks to submit their respective proposals with a final assessment then made to select the preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, the company will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Councillors were due to discuss a motion at Monday nightrsquos meeting which urged the council to acquire land to create a road access through the development site on to St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of the redevelopment proposal and also upgrade and integrate three adjoining privately owned car parks into the proposal.Debate on the motion was adjourned, but in papers submitted prior to the committee meeting senior council staff made it clear that any change would result in the suspension of the development brief and changes to the projectrsquos business case.The local authority has been working on the Irish Street project in partnership with the DfC for some time and when the police base became available for sale, the local authority commissioned a feasibility study exploring options around how the site could be developed in tandem with the Irish Street car park.The study concluded that a so-called mixed use development of the sprawling site would be the most suitable option with the government department subsequently acquiring the land, with the local authority purchasing a strip of land between the Irish Street car park and the former police base.A project board was then set up comprising Downpatrick area councillors and a number of local stakeholders including business community representatives which sought the views of developers and the local community around the sitersquos potential uses and constraints.It was confirmed on Monday night that based on the feedback the development brief was worked up and will go to market in the coming weeks. Interested developers have already been informed of the pending opportunity to submit their proposals.Councillors were told that all of the work to date has focused on site access via current access routes from Market Street and Irish Street, with officials reaffirming that as part of the feasibility study, one option that was explored mdash but subsequently rejected mdash was providing a road access linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoTo explore the purchase of additional lands at this stage would mean that the development brief process would have to be suspended and the business case revisited in line with land valuations, councillors were told.ldquoThe development brief has been drafted in such a way to allow developers to bring additional lands that they may choose to acquire to enhance their plans.The council paper added: ldquoAs part of the development brief, car parking provision will have to be demonstrated and how it is achieved will again be up to the innovation of bids brought forward. Car parking will be a key requirement in the assessment process and indeed planning approval process.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car park is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.As part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics recently appeared on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.Downpatrick councillors say they are acutely aware that the opportunity to redevelop a huge area of town centre land will not happen again, with the redevelopment plan having the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-DundrumCricket.jpg","title":"Dundrum thirds make historic league debut  ","story":"SUNDAY was a momentous day in the history of Dundrum Cricket Club.For the first time the club have been able to enter a thirds team into league cricket and the Meadow was the venue as Dundrum took the field against Ards seconds with a team packed with experience and plenty of youth too.Dundrum captain Neil Reilly won the toss and elected to bat on a super wicket that the ground staff had prepared for the seconds the day before, but had not been used due to bad weather.In the first over, opener Eoin Moag nicked a gooddelivery which was caught frombehind by the Ards wicketkeeper,.This was followed in the second over by a Jack Calvert drive catching the edge of the bat and flying straight up to be caught, leaving Dundrum on  for .The tricky start was made worse when the captain was run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Ards, leaving the hosts on  for .This brought together a partnership between Keba Butler and Kristofer McNeill which finally found traction and started to produce a decent score.By the time Kristofer had been bowled for , the score had risen to  for  with some cracking shots by both batsman which on another day would have produced even more runs, but on a damp outfield restricted the number of fours.Andrew Hammond came in and produced a fast hitting nine to supplement Kebarsquos continued run chase which culminated in a not out score of  by the end of the allotted  overs.Ards came into bat and had a fast start, reaching  without loss after only three overs,.The captainrsquos second over proved to be a turning point in picking up two wickets for just a single run. This fired up Eoin Moag to produce another fine over and clean bowl A Lawther.Ards were now well on the back foot at  for . Captain Reilly took another wicket in the following over before handing the reins to Keba Butler, who promptly took a wicket with his fourth ball.Newcomer Matthew Douglas was introduced into the attack to replace Moag and was soon also among the wickets with only his fourth delivery for the club.This was followed up by Kristofer McNeill coming from behind the stumps to bowl mdash his two overs going for  runs, but also gaining wicket.With Dundrum now firmly in the driving seat, the bowling was passed around with youngsters Andrew Campbell and James Wright bowling well.Experienced clubmen Andrew Hammond and James Orr came on with James taking his first wicket of the season and Ardsrsquo last batsman to give Dundrum victory by  runs.A massive result for the club made possible by a dedicated ground staff, driven committee and some excellent work with young people in the surrounding area which has enabled the thirds to field five U- players, all of whom will be vying for a spot next week and maybe even the seconds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12thMay2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 16%2C 2001  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash The project to transfer one of Ballynahinchrsquos most prestigious buildings was officially launched last week.The historic Market House in Ballynahinch is to get a new lease of le and over the coming months will be transformed into a new civic building during a near poundm redevelopment project.The scheme will complete the Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committeersquos plans to transform the heart of the town and complement the redeveloped square.Local planning chiefs are expected to give the scheme the green light within the next few weeks and preliminary work to strip plaster from the building has revealed ornate stone work and archways which are to be incorporated in the design of the new civic facility.The chairman of the Regeneration Committee, Mr Vincent Fullam, said the public launch of the Market House project marks the end of a long crusade which involved numerous meetings.KILLYLEAGH ndash The future of a multi-million pound marina and housing project for Killyleagh is expected to be known next month.Local planning officials are expected to announcethey are prepared to allow the controversial scheme planned for the Gocean area in the town when they meet local politicians.Speculation is mounting the poundm plan will be refused, but planners have confirmed they have still not reached a final decision on the issue, explaining they are still heavily involved in discussions with a number of organisations.They say it would be wrong to draw any conclusion at this stage as the consultation process is far from complete.It had been widely predicted a public inquiry would be ordered into the project but after its detail was scrutinised by senior planners in Belfast, they passed it back to planners based at Rathkeltair House in Downpatrick and told them there would be no public scrutiny of the scheme.DUNDRUM mdash A call has been made for a review of planning in Dundrum before the beauty of the village is ldquolost forever.The request has been made by SDLP candidate, Mr Charlie McGrath, who says the pace of new housing developments in the area raises a number of issues which need to be addressed.Mr McGrath, a candidate in the Newcastle area, has said it will be too late for locals to complain about the shape of the area after the developers and planners had finished with the village. He has called for a debate into the problem ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Mr McGrath, who is also concerned about the lack of facilities for local residents, said he has written to the local banks about providing cash points and is ldquovery encouraged by the response. He is also pleased that replacement pubic toilets are again to be provided in the village.He said that with the influx of young families in the area there is a ldquoglaring need for youths facilities such as playgrounds and has commended the work of the Dundrum Forum for Play in raising the profile of what he called an ldquounderestimated need.DOWNPATRICK mdash The Great Hall at the Downshire

billed as a prestigious community facility following the extensive renovation programme.It is hoped that once the hall, which boasts state-of-the-art sound and lighting equipment, opens for business, it will be widely used for a number of events for patients, staff and local people.SAINTFIELD mdash A Rowallane area councillor has said the development of a town park in Saintfield is still at the top of his agenda.The DUPrsquos William Dick, who is seeking re-election when voters go to the polls next month, said the creation of a town park is already included in Down Councilrsquos capital development programme.But he wants to see it moved further up the list so people in the Saintfield and surrounding area can have use of the much-needed facility.Mr Dick has already identied a site he

Down District and it is vital future development is sustainable and managed in a sensitive way, he said.Mr Dick said thatre-elected, one of his main priorities will be to have the town park moved up

fishing fleet is not being treated fairly under the new scheme, it has been claimed that just pound.m will be available to decommission prawn boats compared with pound.m for the white fleet boat.Fisherman have reacted angrily to the figures, primarily because they are over three times as many prawn boats fishing in the Irish Sea as white fish trawlers.The figures have been confirmed by

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityNearly halfof staff who work with pre-school children believe the attainment gap between poorer under-fives and their more affluent peers has grown during the pandemic, the Early Years Alliancefound.A poll of more than , workers in nurseries, pre-schools and childminding settings in England found that % say fewer children from all backgrounds are meeting the expected level of attainment in the prime areas of learning and development since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.More than halfsaid they had observed negative changes in childrenrsquos learning and development when they ed after the first lockdown.One respondent said youngsters had forgotten how to put on their own shoes, while another said some pre-schoolers now look at toys ldquoblankly and do not know how to use their imaginations and play.Of those who saw negative changes, % said these were more evident in children from more economically disadvantaged backgrounds.Childrenrsquos personal, social and emotional development, as well as their communication and language development, have been particularly affected by the pandemic, according to early years workers.One respondent to the survey said youngsters are now ldquoclingy, upset and afraid of strangers following lockdown periods.They added: ldquoThey have lost the ability to play independently. They are taking a long time to settle away from their parents.ldquoSome have ed with very good literacy and numeracy skills but are nowhere near where they should be with personal, social and emotional development, or physical and self-care skills.ldquoThey are lacking in gross motor skills because they have been indoors a lot, and some who could put on their own shoes before lockdown have forgotten how.     Another respondent said: ldquoThey look at toys and loose parts blankly, with no idea how to explore and use their imaginations.ldquoThey often ask for the TV or to play with my phone and are confused when I tell them lsquonorsquo.ldquoI worry about what this year has done to their development and how long it will take to make up for lost learning.One respondent said: ldquoThe only thing preventing us from delivering all the interventions we would like to be able to deliver is a lack of finances.ldquoWe are running with the minimum level of staff to meet the statutory requirements, because we cannot afford to pay additional staff.ldquoMore staff would enable more, and more effective, interventions which would have a huge impact on the learning and development of all our children but particularly those that are currently under-achieving.More than four in fiverespondents said the Government is not doing enough to support early years providers to tackle the impact of the pandemic on under-fives, with many citing a lack of adequate financial resources and an inability to invest in additional staff to offer targeted support.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already made pound. billion of catch-up funding available in England to help children who have faced disruption to their education due to Covid-.Only pound million of this package will go towards supporting early language development in pre-reception settings, while a further pound million will be available to schools for children in reception classes.EYA chief executive Neil Leitch said: ldquoPractitioners responding to the survey said they know exactly what children at their settings most need to recover lost skills and confidence, and that the only thing stopping them from taking action is a lack of resources.ldquoIt is therefore vital that nurseries, pre-schools and childminders are given dedicated financial support for recovery, and the autonomy to use it as they see fit.ldquoProper funding would enable the targeted interventions needed to improve childrenrsquos personal, social and emotional development alongside their physical development, which many respondents noted have suffered as a result of being cut off from their friends and opportunities to play and explore.ldquoGiven the proven link between investment in early years and better educational and social outcomes, especially for the most disadvantaged children, a failure to invest now would be unforgivable.On Friday, the Department for Educationencouraged all state schools in England with a reception class to apply for resources and training as part of its pound million early years catch-up programme.It is hoped the scheme will raise the outcomes in Reception-age childrenrsquos early language, communication and speech skills.Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said: ldquoWe know the first years of a childrsquos le can be the most formative, which is why this Government is making it a priority to make sure all children have the best start in le.ldquoSpeaking and communicating with confidence sets a child up for success in le, so itrsquos vital that we support children to grow in confidence with these skills ndash especially those for whom English is not their first language or who have been more isolated during the pandemic than their peers..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Three in five workers say pre-school children are behind with early development article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This meant thatGFG sold a product to a dferent company, it could send the invoice to Greensill and be paid right away, rather than having to wait potentially months for the customer to pay its bills.Bringing in money this way can be useful for companies with tight cash flows.However, how Greensill and GFG did business together is being investigated by fraud investigators.It is likely to spark renewed fears for the future of GFGrsquos employees.     .push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Who is Sanjeev Gupta, the owner of GFG Alliance  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

After researching alternative therapy to try and prolong her le, she is planning to travel to Mexico - but she needs at least pound, to do so. On Thursday morning, over pound, had been raised on her Go Fund Me page. In an update, Jemma said: My husband Clive and I have been just so overwhelmed by the generosity of family and friends and the whole community over the past few days. It really has brought a sense of hope back to me since I got my scan results on Monday, to have not only achieved my target figure but surpassed it by an insane amount - my miracle. I have received thousands of messages from people that are in similar situations, people that have battled and are winning as well as family members of the unlucky victims of this indiscriminate disease. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone that has donated, shared my story and prayed for me and my family, I am truly blessed to have had this unimaginable support in such a short period of time.
