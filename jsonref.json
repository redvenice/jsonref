What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.

My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"Fleetwood Mac tour Tickets dates announced Lindsey Buckinghams departure","story":"Some Kardashians and Kylie Jenner unfollow Kanye West\u0026#8217s Twitter after Trump postsWho was Fanny Blankers-Koen?

Danish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming poolDanish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.Perched on a rotor, they will sweep an area the size of three football pitches and — according to the manufacturer — pull the same weight as 16 African elephants, and each year produce electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of \u0027around 10,000 homes — that\u0027s a whole town\u0027.Which may sound like a lot except that you would require about 7,500 such turbines to supply the UK at peak time, and in any case, the intermittent nature of wind can\u0027t generate an uninterrupted supply to a single house.These monsters, however, will shortly be dwarfed by the world\u0027s biggest turbine model — the Haliade-X 12 MW — which will soon be tested by GE Renewable Energy at Blyth, Northumberland.Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homes. The size of such a turbine will make it too obtrusive to site on land. But one possibility is that it could be erected in large numbers far offshore, in an area such as Dogger Bank — a shallow stretch of the North Sea about 60 miles off the coast.This is the proposed location of a giant wind farm being developed by the Dutch firm TenneT.          Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homesWith a man-made island to house its substations, and many hundreds of turbines, it could theoretically have a capacity as huge as 30GW (gigawatts), though because of its low productivity it would still only generate energy equal to about a third of the UK\u0027s needs, and would contribute little, or nothing, to security of supply.What does this all mean for the future of energy? If wind power\u0027s advocates are to be believed, something extraordinary.The average power capacity needed to meet electricity demand at any moment for the UK is 36GW, with a summer low in the 20s and a winter peak of 62GW.So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needs.Imagine: no more \u0027dirty\u0027 fossil fuel power just thousands of offshore turbines swishing in the distance, generating free, \u0027low carbon\u0027 electricity until the end of time.So runs the theory. But then, as with so many utopian schemes, there are huge catches — starting with the eye-watering cost.Electricity produced by onshore wind costs twice as much as conventional gas-fired electricity generation offshore wind three times as much. The only reason the wind industry is viable is because of the massive subsidies it receives. Subsidies raised silently from your energy bill.British Gas has said that by the end of this year, green taxes will add a fifth to the average fuel bill. Iain Conn, boss of parent company Centrica, said: \u0027It is going to be, in our estimates, about £200 on everyone\u0027s bill which is getting on for 20 per cent.\u0027By 202021, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the total cost of all the subsidies for renewable electricity will be nearly £11 billion a year, and wind power will be taking more than half of that. And don\u0027t be taken in by that ad campaign by Greenpeace and a coalition of environmental groups and electricity suppliers last year, claiming that the cost of wind energy is plummeting to the point where it\u0027s now cheaper than fossil fuel power.No it\u0027s not. The ads were withdrawn as the result of a successful complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, because they were deliberately misleading propaganda, based on projected costs, not real, current figures.In fact, Professor Gordon Hughes, of the University of Edinburgh, and his colleagues showed in a recent study published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation think-tank, that the capital costs of new offshore wind farms do not appear to be falling and indeed appear to be still rising as wind projects move into deeper waters.This new generation of mega-turbines, we\u0027re told by green advocates, will solve most of these problems. Bigger blades and taller towers mean they\u0027ll be able to capture the more plentiful wind that blows at higher altitudes, unlike the smaller turbines beset by \u0027low wind days\u0027 (one in every 5.6 days according to energy union GMB) when they\u0027re generating little, if any, power. Thus they will become more cost-effective.Also, being far out at sea, they won\u0027t alienate all those rural voters who can\u0027t stand having wind turbines industrialising the countryside, disturbing their sleep and killing bats and birds.Despite its huge cost, offshore wind remains a vital part of the Government\u0027s energy strategy — its best hope of meeting its EU-driven CO2 reduction obligations, under the 2008 Climate Change Act. But according to John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation, this is a chimera.          So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needsWind energy, he says, will never be a solution because of \u0027fundamental physics: wind, by its nature, is a low density and intermittent flow of energy. Correcting those deficiencies to supply reliable electricity to consumers means huge capital expense in the turbines and in the electricity system as a whole\u0027.Making turbines bigger and putting them out at sea only makes things worse. They are much more expensive to erect and maintain in a remote, hostile environment, and have a much shorter working life.Analysts have known for years that rising repair costs would mean the economic lifetimes of turbines were way under the 25 years promised by the industry.In February this year, Danish offshore wind operator Ørsted admitted it might have to repair the blades of more than 600 turbines, after just a few years on the water, at a cost of about £1million per turbine.And the bigger they are, the worse this is going to get, for all sorts of reasons.These machines are already dealing with large forces, putting huge loads on their components. Making them bigger just increases the problem, and not just because of increased weight. Wind shear — the difference in wind speed at different heights — leads to uneven loading at the top and bottom of the blade radius and causes huge strain on the working parts. This is really difficult and very expensive engineering.Then there\u0027s the erosion of the blades, due to high-speed impacts with small particles, dust, ice and salt. Ørsted is replacing those blades because their edges had become rough, and as any engineer will tell you, when a wing gets rough it becomes unstable.Then there\u0027s the wind industry\u0027s dirty little secret: according to some concerned ecologists, those spinning blades could be killing millions of birds and protected bats every year.In Spain alone, one survey estimated, up to 330 birds and 670 bats are killed per turbine per year a survey in Sweden put the bird death toll as high as 895 per turbine. The wind industry denies these estimates, which are hard to confirm, not least because the areas below the turbines where the bodies might be found are often jealously guarded.But those figures are for onshore wind turbines. It\u0027s likely that fewer birds are killed offshore because they are more scarce.Indeed, according to a recent study at Vattenfall\u0027s Thanet wind farm seven miles off the coast of Kent, just six collisions were recorded on video and radar over a two-year period — an average of one every four months.The industry (which funded the Vattenfall study) is desperately trying to persuade us all that there isn\u0027t a problem. But the RSPB, which has historically leaned over backwards to help the industry, is finally losing patience and has just rejected the latest impact study.Concerns have also been raised about the damage done to other marine wildlife by offshore wind turbines. There is evidence to suggest the turbines\u0027 lower frequency noise is disrupting the sonar of whales and dolphins, causing them to beach and die. Another offshore wind farm was implicated in the death of baby seals found stillborn on the beach nearby.But if wind is really so expensive, inefficient and environmentally damaging, why does our Government remain so committed to it?Largely because of the lobbying of a hugely powerful industry. An industry desperate not to lose its extraordinarily generous subsidies.For example the (mostly foreign) owners of the London Array — the largest wind farm in the world, off the coast of Kent, which was opened by David Cameron in 2013 — receives about £190 million a year in subsidies, on top of selling electricity they make. That sort of windfall, forgive the pun, ensures the industry presses its case with ruthless efficiency.It is now under real pressure. The Treasury has put a moratorium on new subsidies until the middle of the next decade at the earliest, and the wind industry is trying to survive by pretending that falling generation costs have made them economically viable. Secretly, they are hoping for a change of policy (Jeremy Corbyn?) and a stonking carbon tax.This latest propaganda about \u0027bigger\u0027, \u0027better\u0027, \u0027faster\u0027 new mega-turbines is designed to keep us and the politicians in the industry\u0027s thrall.Even now, they are building the new biggest wind farm in the world, called Hornsea Project One, off the Yorkshire coast. It will have 174 turbines over a 240-square mile area, each 620ft high (189 metres). And that\u0027s before we get on to Hornsea Projects Two and Three, which are already in the pipeline and which, you can bet, will be still larger and with even more monstrous turbines.As the Renewable Energy Foundation\u0027s John Constable explains: \u0027All this is designed to give the illusion that there has been massive technological progress in the industry when in fact the major problems remain unsolved: the energy in the wind is of low quality. Turning it into high quality, reliable energy for the consumer is still very expensive indeed.\u0027Yet the propaganda often finds a ready audience because so many want to believe, against all the evidence, that wind must be a preferable alternative to our gas-fired turbines, vanishing set of coal-fired plants or ageing nuclear reactors.We don\u0027t want to hear about the intermittency of the wind, which makes it so problematic as a reliable source of power for an advanced economy and means we need alternative generating capacity as well.Nor about all the pollution — and extra CO2 — generated by the gas-fired back-up for when the wind\u0027s not blowing. Nor all those birds and bats being killed. Nor the capitalist fat-cats getting rich off all the subsidies we have to pay them.As those Nazis believed in the Thirties, so today\u0027s Greens — and the attendant climate industry — would have us believe today: that wind is the kinder, cheaper, cleaner, more natural solution to our energy problems.Well, it isn\u0027t. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/26/10/4A90B2F400000578-0-image-a-20_1522055311213.jpg","title":"British adults internet double time did 10 years ago","story":"    Ofcom has said that for many people not having the internet would be a threat to their livelihood Nine in ten adults are now online – including 96 per cent of those under 55 and 98 per cent of those aged 16 to 24. Smartphones are the most popular device for surfing the web, meaning we are more connected than ever before – not just using the internet at home or work.Ofcom\u0027s Adults Media Use and Attitudes report said: \u0027Whereas in previous years being without internet access would have been an irritating inconvenience, some would now consider it a threat to their livelihood.\u0027As reliance on the net increases \u0027people need the skills to question and make judgements about their online environment\u0027, Ofcom warned.The secret to happiness?

I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine. He never said he agrees with his politics.\u0027 In a separate tweet Kardashian reiterated that she loved and respected her husband.  \u0027Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that\u0027s why I love him and respect him,\u0027 she said.           Less than an hour later at 10.30 PST, West tweeted that his wife Kim Kardashian had called him about the Trump tweet          Kardashian (pictured with West in a recent family photo) was a vocal supporter of Clinton during the 2016 presidential election campaign           But Kardashian later took to her own Twitter to defend her husband, tweeting around 12.30pm PST that her husband was \u0027years ahead of his time\u0027          She also hit back at the media, claiming reports of West having \u0027mental health issues\u0027 were \u0027not fair\u0027 and \u0027actually scary\u0027          Donald Trump Jr later tweeted his support following Kardashian\u0027s defense of West, using the 2016 Clinton hashtag #ImWithHer\u0027And in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren\u0027t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time.\u0027  Kardashian also hit back at the media, which she said was trying to \u0027demonize\u0027 West.  \u0027Your commentary on Kanye being erratic \u0026amp his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u0027 Don Jr jumped in to show his support for Kardashian, retweeting her defense of West and adding #ImWithHer - the hashtag originally used to show support for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.West\u0027s public support for Trump even made its way into the discussion at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. A reporter asked Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Trump had reached out to West following the rapper\u0027s recent praise. \u0027I don\u0027t know of any conversation that they\u0027ve had over the last week or so, I\u0027ll keep you posted if that changes,\u0027 Sanders said, breaking into a smile. \u0027I know they met during the transition, that\u0027s the only meeting I\u0027m aware of that\u0027s taken place, or conversation.\u0027             Ivanka Trump jumped on board to retweet Kanye with the hashtag #truth          Eric Trump also got on the Kanye train, retweeting the same tweet his dad did and adding a few American flags           At 1pm PST he tweeted a screen grab of Trump\u0027s retweet - posted half an hour earlier - which he had seen from mediatkd, a Kanye West Twitter fan page          West, who made multiple references to becoming the \u0027future president\u0027 in his Wednesday tweets, also posted a picture of a poster for him to become president in 2024  At 1.30PST West posted a screengrab, which appears to be from his longtime collaborator Tracey Mills, texting him that they needed to talk about his Make America Great Again hatWest first revealed his support for Trump shortly after the November 2016 election, when he told a California concert audience he would have voted for the Republican.\u0027I told y\u0027all I didn\u0027t vote, right? But if I would\u0027ve voted, I would\u0027ve voted for Trump,\u0027 he said.\u0027We live in a racist country. That is a fact. This world is racist, OK? Let\u0027s stop being distracted to focus on that as much.\u0027  But in a separate tweet on Wednesday, Kanye wrote that he also loved Clinton, who Kardashian publicly supported in the 2016 presidential election.\u0027If your friend jumps off the bridge you don\u0027t have to do the same,\u0027 he began. \u0027Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you.\u0027 Kris Jenner slams claims she is fighting with Kanye West...Kanye West bonds with daughter North in sweet post amid...Kanye West hit by claims he \u0027battled an opioid addiction\u0027......Share this article\u0027For people in my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don\u0027t tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary I love Hillary too.\u0027 The rapper continued to discuss free thought, saying he loves when \u0027people have their own ideas\u0027. \u0027You don\u0027t have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love. That\u0027s free thought,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027I\u0027m not even political. I\u0027m not a democrat or a republican.\u0027           West (pictured outside an LA music studio on Tuesday) recently came under fire for tweets supporting far right-wing media personality Candace Owens           Around 9.30am PST West was discussing free thought, saying he loves when \u0027people have their own ideas\u0027          The rapper declared that he was \u0027not scared anymore\u0027 and \u0027not scared of the media\u0027 eitherWest declared that he was \u0027not scared anymore\u0027 and \u0027not scared of the media\u0027.  \u0027I\u0027m not scared of the past and I\u0027m optimistic about the future,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027This tweet is in love not fear.\u0027 \u0027With love I am invincible,\u0027 he continued in a separate tweet.    \u0027Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.\u0027 ‏\u0027No race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love,\u0027 another tweet read.           West also began tweeting about love, saying it made him \u0027invincible\u0027 and that \u0027no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love\u0027 West\u0027s Wednesday afternoon tweets began with a proclamation that \u0027traditional thinkers\u0027 were locked in a \u0027mental prison\u0027. \u0027Free thinkers don\u0027t fear retaliation for your thoughts,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison.\u0027  \u0027You are free. You\u0027ve already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.\u0027West told his fans he was hitting them with his \u0027zig zag thoughts\u0027 and encouraged them to \u0027unlearn linear thinking\u0027, \u0027decentralize\u0027, and \u0027burn that excel spread sheet\u0027, phrases that were written in three separate tweets. The tweets came just hours after West confirmed he had cut ties with his longtime manager Scooter Braun.           At one point during his stream-of-consciousness tweets, just before 8am PST, West shared a photo of eldest daughter North with a lady bug           The tweets came just hours after West confirmed he had cut ties with his longtime manager Scooter Braun at 7am PST          But six hours later West would tweet that he considered Braun to be a \u0027genius\u0027 and hoped his former manager would be part of a \u0027new platform\u0027 he was working on \u0027I no longer have a manager, I can\u0027t be managed,\u0027 he tweeted on Wednesday morning. \u0027I\u0027m nobody\u0027s client,\u0027 a separate tweet read.  Braun confirmed the news on Twitter this week, writing: \u0027A man\u0027s loyalty is truly tested when he is willing to stand by someone who will never show that same respect.\u0027Don\u0027t show that same love and loyalty waiting for reciprocation .. do it because your integrity demands.\u0027 Later in the day West said he wanted Braun to be part of a \u0027new platform\u0027 he was creating. \u0027Scooter is a genius,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027He\u0027s more than a manager so is Irving. We all need to sit together.\u0027  West also revealed he got rid of his last lawyer \u0027because he wouldn\u0027t come to work full-time\u0027.  \u0027I also asked my last manager to come work full time for Yeezy of course the last lawyer and manager said no,\u0027 he explained, seemingly referring to Braun. \u0027So now I hired a CEO and a CFO and i have two full time lawyers as of now.\u0027           Around 8am PST West was proclaiming he was the \u0027single highest paid person in footwear\u0027 and said his fashion company Yeezy is the second \u0027fastest growing company in history\u0027West then went on to declare himself \u0027this generation\u0027s Ford Hughes Jobs Disney\u0027, referring to Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, Steve Jobs, and Walt Disney. The rapper proclaimed he was the \u0027single highest paid person in footwear\u0027 and said his fashion company Yeezy is the second \u0027fastest growing company in history\u0027. \u0027It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history,\u0027 West declared in another post. West\u0027s tweets then turned to the media, as he called out both TMZ founder Harvey Levin as well as People Magazine for recent stories about the rapper.\u0027Harvey Levin of TMZ your hearing from your future president,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Let\u0027s be friends.

\u0027couldn\u0027t get anything done\u0027 when Barack Obama was president. \u0027I reached out to Obama for years and couldn\u0027t get anything done, but Trump gave me a meeting,\u0027 Darden claimed West said during their private conversation. Sources denied Daren\u0027s claims that West had an addiction and told The Blast on Monday that he had actually been in the hospital for suffering extreme paranoia after not sleeping for over 48 hours.In the same report, sources close to the rapper claimed that people in his \u0027inner circle\u0027 are concerned with his mental health.They also claimed West has an acute mental illness which was even used as his defense in the lawsuit against Lloyds Of London over insurance money when it came to his canceled tour at the end of 2016.

Apple\u0027.   Kanye has had many buzzing since his return to Twitter last week but an insider for the publication said that his comments \u0027aren\u0027t making a lot of sense\u0027 to his team.It was believed that his social media flood were just to promote his upcoming albums, however, the site report that friends and family believe that he may be \u0027spiraling into a dark place.\u0027A day after Darden claimed West had an opioid addiction, the rapper called into his show on Tuesday.           Rumors have also swirled that West\u0027s recent Twitter outbursts have caused him to have

Jenner has been upset with how \u0027erratic\u0027 West is acting and that she\u0027s concerned about \u0027her daughter\u0027s brand\u0027. \u0027Everyone is really, really worried,\u0027 the source added. A source said that West has been \u0027eccentric and erratic\u0027 and that he \u0027genuinely believes he\u0027s God and a genius\u0027, while another claimed he\u0027s \u0027all over the place\u0027. But another source close to the rapper said he\u0027s just \u0027being Kanye\u0027 and that he likes to \u0027stir the pot\u0027. \u0027He\u0027s willing to take risks with his public

shamed after making a string of nuisance 999 calls shouting: \u0027Muslims Out\u0027 in the wake of the Manchester Arena terror attack.Dorothy Anlezark, 75, got drunk and repeatedly rang the emergency services in the days after the suicide bombing last May.The atrocity killed 22 people and injured 400 others following an Ariana Grande concert.During the calls Anlezark, who lives alone in Clifton, Greater Manchester, hurled abuse at call handlers and shouted: \u0027Muslims out. All Muslims out. Get them out!\u0027Police tracked her down and arrested her but the OAP then made another threatening 999 call saying: \u0027If you come here with batons, I will baton you.\u0027Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court heard the 999 calls made by Anlezark had gone on for five years and police had repeatedly spoken to her about them.It emerged in some instances she would call 999 for a \u0027chat\u0027 about unimportant matters due to her isolation and loneliness.Anlezark admitted two offences of sending communication conveying a threatening message between May and November 2017 but was given a two-year conditional discharge after she \u0027accepted the error of her ways.\u0027Earlier prosecuting, Mr Gareth Hughes said: \u0027The background to this case is something the police have been dealing with for quite some time. \u0027They tried to deal with it in other ways to avoid prosecution but got to a point where all avenues had been explored.          Police tracked down the pensioner and arrested her but the OAP then made another threatening 999 call saying: \u0027If you come here with batons, I will baton you\u0027\u0027The defendant made a high volume of calls to the police. 999 call handlers have been dealing with these calls over the past five years. \u0027They have tried to refer the defendant for mental health treatment or other assistance but for one reason or another she did not engage.\u0027Sometimes it is just wanting to talk about unimportant matters and other times it is abusive. \u0027In May 2017 a number of calls were made on the 30th, this may be as a result of the Manchester bombing and there is reference made.          The atrocity killed 22 people and injured 400 others following an Ariana Grande concert.

All Muslims out. Get them out!\u0027 following the attack in May\u0027She was shouting: \u0027Muslims out. All Muslims out. Get them out.\u0027\u0027The police arrested her and she was summoned to court. Following her first appearance there was a further call - that was a threatening phone call. \u0027She contacted the police, gives her name and uses the same number saying: If you come here with batons, I will baton you.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Mr Nnamdi Inegbu said: \u0027The defendant has pleaded guilty and has never tried to step back from her actions.           Manchester Magistrates\u0027 Court heard the 999 calls made by Anlezark had gone on for five years and police had repeatedly spoken to her about them\u0027There were concerns about dementia and she has been offered help but has not embraced that help as much as she should have done.\u0027There has not been any re-offending since these matters have been to court and I think she has really recognised and accepted the error of her ways. \u0027This stems from a combination of loneliness, drinking and stress.\u0027She was at home, very isolated and when she decided to have a drink she would get on the phone and make these comments. It is a sad case she is now 75 years of age.\u0027Sentencing Anlezark JP Hamid Pouladi said: \u0027We sincerely hope what we have been told is how you are feeling and realising the error of your ways and stopping what is causing you to go down that route which is alcohol.\u0027We are minded to go with a recommendation from probation which is a conditional discharge. \u0027That will hang over your head for the next two years.

She made the Dutch team as a sprinter and her coach, Jan Blankers, who would later become her husband, encouraged her to enter the Berlin 1936 Olympic trials.At 18, Fanny was selected to compete in the high jump and 4x100m relay at the Games but came in fifth place for both events. Here, she met her idol Jesse Owens and got his autograph, which became her most treasured possession.In 1938, Fanny earned her first world record and won international medals resulting in many expecting her to excel in the upcoming Helsinki Olympic Games in 1940. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the competition was cancelled a week before the Netherlands was invaded.Fanny Blankers-Koen  children and husbandBefore WWII, Fanny had become engaged to her coach Jan and on August 29, 1940, the couple were married.At the time, Jan coached the Dutch women’s athletics team and a sports journalist, even though he originally believed that women should not compete in sport. This changed after his feelings towards Fanny changed.After Fanny gave birth to her first child, Jan Junior, in 1941, it was assumed that her career was over, as at the time, it was unusual for female athletes to be married and even more so, to be mothers. As the war went on, she earned six more world records between 1942 and 1944 in athletics.          After Fanny gave birth to Jan Junior in 1941, it was assumed that her sporting career was overNotably in 1943, Fanny improved on her high jump record by 5cm to 1.71m at a special competition in Amsterdam and she tied the 100m world record but this was not formally recognised as she was competing against men when setting the record.The war meant that food was scarce and the winter of 1944-1945, also known as the Hongerwinter, Fanny and other athletes were forced to take a break from competing. However, at the 1946 European Championship, Fanny made a comeback weeks after giving birth to Fanny Junior.Although she received a lot of backlash for competing and not staying home with her children, she continued. She told the New York Times in 1982 that she ‘got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with - how do you say it? - short trousers’.British team manager Jack Crump also said that she was ‘too old to make the grade’, unaware that she was actually three months pregnant at the time. At the 1948 Olympics, Fanny won four of nine women’s events: 100m, 80m hurdles, 200m and 4x100m relay and became the first to win four golds in a single Olympics.She became known as the ‘Flying Housewife’, the ‘Flying Dutchmam’ and ‘Amazing Fanny’ by the press and was praised on her return to Amsterdam. Reporters described her style as ‘like she was chasing kids out of the pantry’ and ‘racing to the kitchen to rescue a batch of burning biscuits’.She was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange Nassau.          On her return to Amsterdam, Fanny was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange NassauFanny Blankers-Koen controversyHowever, after a period of fame and travelling abroad to promote women in sport, a new talent Foekje Dillema emerged and was dubbed the ‘new Fanny’ after she broke the record for 200m.However, tests on cells obtained from her clothing found that Dillema had a Y-chromosome in her DNA and she was possibly a 46XX46XY woman.This deformation is also known as ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism and many believed that this new development was an attempt by Jan and Fanny to eliminate the competition, but these are just rumours.

She was also commended at a gala in Monaco, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and was declared the ‘Female Athlete of the Century’.Prior to her death, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and lived in a psychiatric nursing home. Fanny died at age 85 in Hoofddorp on January 25, 2004.What is a Google Doodle?In the Google Doodle for April 26, 2018, Fanny Blankers-Koen is honoured on what would have been her 100th birthday and is depicted running ahead of the rest on a track.

The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/21/4B8E60C700000578-0-image-a-24_1524688358911.jpg","title":"JAMES DELINGPOLE wind turbine trick","story":"    General Electric plans to build the world\u0027s largest wind turbine - twice as high as Big BenAfter an eventful war — which included springing Mussolini from his mountain-top jail in a daring glider operation and planning a (happily abortive) assassination attempt on Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin — the plucky SS-Obersturmbannführer settled in Spain where he spent his later years campaigning on behalf of the nascent wind industry.But it has taken until now for the Nazis\u0027 dream of a world powered by wind to become even remotely plausible.EU must be joking!

At last, the era of Big Wind is upon us, with a new generation of turbines that are bigger — and create more electricity — than ever before.          Danish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming poolDanish firm LM Wind Power, a supplier of components to the industry, has since 2016 offered blades 290ft (88.4 metres) long — bigger than the wing of an Airbus A380, or nearly twice the length of an Olympic-sized swimming pool.Perched on a rotor, they will sweep an area the size of three football pitches and — according to the manufacturer — pull the same weight as 16 African elephants, and each year produce electricity equivalent to the annual consumption of \u0027around 10,000 homes — that\u0027s a whole town\u0027.Which may sound like a lot except that you would require about 7,500 such turbines to supply the UK at peak time, and in any case, the intermittent nature of wind can\u0027t generate an uninterrupted supply to a single house.These monsters, however, will shortly be dwarfed by the world\u0027s biggest turbine model — the Haliade-X 12 MW — which will soon be tested by GE Renewable Energy at Blyth, Northumberland.Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homes. The size of such a turbine will make it too obtrusive to site on land. But one possibility is that it could be erected in large numbers far offshore, in an area such as Dogger Bank — a shallow stretch of the North Sea about 60 miles off the coast.This is the proposed location of a giant wind farm being developed by the Dutch firm TenneT.          Standing 853ft (260 metres) tall with 351ft-long blades (107 metres), it will produce electricity equal to the annual consumption of 16,000 homesWith a man-made island to house its substations, and many hundreds of turbines, it could theoretically have a capacity as huge as 30GW (gigawatts), though because of its low productivity it would still only generate energy equal to about a third of the UK\u0027s needs, and would contribute little, or nothing, to security of supply.What does this all mean for the future of energy? If wind power\u0027s advocates are to be believed, something extraordinary.The average power capacity needed to meet electricity demand at any moment for the UK is 36GW, with a summer low in the 20s and a winter peak of 62GW.So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needs.Imagine: no more \u0027dirty\u0027 fossil fuel power just thousands of offshore turbines swishing in the distance, generating free, \u0027low carbon\u0027 electricity until the end of time.So runs the theory. But then, as with so many utopian schemes, there are huge catches — starting with the eye-watering cost.Electricity produced by onshore wind costs twice as much as conventional gas-fired electricity generation offshore wind three times as much. The only reason the wind industry is viable is because of the massive subsidies it receives. Subsidies raised silently from your energy bill.British Gas has said that by the end of this year, green taxes will add a fifth to the average fuel bill. Iain Conn, boss of parent company Centrica, said: \u0027It is going to be, in our estimates, about £200 on everyone\u0027s bill which is getting on for 20 per cent.\u0027By 202021, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the total cost of all the subsidies for renewable electricity will be nearly £11 billion a year, and wind power will be taking more than half of that. And don\u0027t be taken in by that ad campaign by Greenpeace and a coalition of environmental groups and electricity suppliers last year, claiming that the cost of wind energy is plummeting to the point where it\u0027s now cheaper than fossil fuel power.No it\u0027s not. The ads were withdrawn as the result of a successful complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority, because they were deliberately misleading propaganda, based on projected costs, not real, current figures.In fact, Professor Gordon Hughes, of the University of Edinburgh, and his colleagues showed in a recent study published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation think-tank, that the capital costs of new offshore wind farms do not appear to be falling and indeed appear to be still rising as wind projects move into deeper waters.This new generation of mega-turbines, we\u0027re told by green advocates, will solve most of these problems. Bigger blades and taller towers mean they\u0027ll be able to capture the more plentiful wind that blows at higher altitudes, unlike the smaller turbines beset by \u0027low wind days\u0027 (one in every 5.6 days according to energy union GMB) when they\u0027re generating little, if any, power. Thus they will become more cost-effective.Also, being far out at sea, they won\u0027t alienate all those rural voters who can\u0027t stand having wind turbines industrialising the countryside, disturbing their sleep and killing bats and birds.Despite its huge cost, offshore wind remains a vital part of the Government\u0027s energy strategy — its best hope of meeting its EU-driven CO2 reduction obligations, under the 2008 Climate Change Act. But according to John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation, this is a chimera.          So that 30GW Dogger Bank project alone — if it ever comes to fruition — ought nearly to be enough to supply much of Britain\u0027s electricity needsWind energy, he says, will never be a solution because of \u0027fundamental physics: wind, by its nature, is a low density and intermittent flow of energy. Correcting those deficiencies to supply reliable electricity to consumers means huge capital expense in the turbines and in the electricity system as a whole\u0027.Making turbines bigger and putting them out at sea only makes things worse. They are much more expensive to erect and maintain in a remote, hostile environment, and have a much shorter working life.Analysts have known for years that rising repair costs would mean the economic lifetimes of turbines were way under the 25 years promised by the industry.In February this year, Danish offshore wind operator Ørsted admitted it might have to repair the blades of more than 600 turbines, after just a few years on the water, at a cost of about £1million per turbine.And the bigger they are, the worse this is going to get, for all sorts of reasons.These machines are already dealing with large forces, putting huge loads on their components. Making them bigger just increases the problem, and not just because of increased weight. Wind shear — the difference in wind speed at different heights — leads to uneven loading at the top and bottom of the blade radius and causes huge strain on the working parts. This is really difficult and very expensive engineering.Then there\u0027s the erosion of the blades, due to high-speed impacts with small particles, dust, ice and salt. Ørsted is replacing those blades because their edges had become rough, and as any engineer will tell you, when a wing gets rough it becomes unstable.Then there\u0027s the wind industry\u0027s dirty little secret: according to some concerned ecologists, those spinning blades could be killing millions of birds and protected bats every year.In Spain alone, one survey estimated, up to 330 birds and 670 bats are killed per turbine per year a survey in Sweden put the bird death toll as high as 895 per turbine. The wind industry denies these estimates, which are hard to confirm, not least because the areas below the turbines where the bodies might be found are often jealously guarded.But those figures are for onshore wind turbines. It\u0027s likely that fewer birds are killed offshore because they are more scarce.Indeed, according to a recent study at Vattenfall\u0027s Thanet wind farm seven miles off the coast of Kent, just six collisions were recorded on video and radar over a two-year period — an average of one every four months.The industry (which funded the Vattenfall study) is desperately trying to persuade us all that there isn\u0027t a problem. But the RSPB, which has historically leaned over backwards to help the industry, is finally losing patience and has just rejected the latest impact study.Concerns have also been raised about the damage done to other marine wildlife by offshore wind turbines. There is evidence to suggest the turbines\u0027 lower frequency noise is disrupting the sonar of whales and dolphins, causing them to beach and die. Another offshore wind farm was implicated in the death of baby seals found stillborn on the beach nearby.But if wind is really so expensive, inefficient and environmentally damaging, why does our Government remain so committed to it?Largely because of the lobbying of a hugely powerful industry. An industry desperate not to lose its extraordinarily generous subsidies.For example the (mostly foreign) owners of the London Array — the largest wind farm in the world, off the coast of Kent, which was opened by David Cameron in 2013 — receives about £190 million a year in subsidies, on top of selling electricity they make. That sort of windfall, forgive the pun, ensures the industry presses its case with ruthless efficiency.It is now under real pressure. The Treasury has put a moratorium on new subsidies until the middle of the next decade at the earliest, and the wind industry is trying to survive by pretending that falling generation costs have made them economically viable. Secretly, they are hoping for a change of policy (Jeremy Corbyn?) and a stonking carbon tax.This latest propaganda about \u0027bigger\u0027, \u0027better\u0027, \u0027faster\u0027 new mega-turbines is designed to keep us and the politicians in the industry\u0027s thrall.Even now, they are building the new biggest wind farm in the world, called Hornsea Project One, off the Yorkshire coast. It will have 174 turbines over a 240-square mile area, each 620ft high (189 metres). And that\u0027s before we get on to Hornsea Projects Two and Three, which are already in the pipeline and which, you can bet, will be still larger and with even more monstrous turbines.As the Renewable Energy Foundation\u0027s John Constable explains: \u0027All this is designed to give the illusion that there has been massive technological progress in the industry when in fact the major problems remain unsolved: the energy in the wind is of low quality. Turning it into high quality, reliable energy for the consumer is still very expensive indeed.\u0027Yet the propaganda often finds a ready audience because so many want to believe, against all the evidence, that wind must be a preferable alternative to our gas-fired turbines, vanishing set of coal-fired plants or ageing nuclear reactors.We don\u0027t want to hear about the intermittency of the wind, which makes it so problematic as a reliable source of power for an advanced economy and means we need alternative generating capacity as well.Nor about all the pollution — and extra CO2 — generated by the gas-fired back-up for when the wind\u0027s not blowing. Nor all those birds and bats being killed. Nor the capitalist fat-cats getting rich off all the subsidies we have to pay them.As those Nazis believed in the Thirties, so today\u0027s Greens — and the attendant climate industry — would have us believe today: that wind is the kinder, cheaper, cleaner, more natural solution to our energy problems.Well, it isn\u0027t. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/26/10/4A90B2F400000578-0-image-a-20_1522055311213.jpg","title":"British adults internet double time did 10 years ago","story":"    Ofcom has said that for many people not having the internet would be a threat to their livelihood Nine in ten adults are now online – including 96 per cent of those under 55 and 98 per cent of those aged 16 to 24. Smartphones are the most popular device for surfing the web, meaning we are more connected than ever before – not just using the internet at home or work.Ofcom\u0027s Adults Media Use and Attitudes report said: \u0027Whereas in previous years being without internet access would have been an irritating inconvenience, some would now consider it a threat to their livelihood.\u0027As reliance on the net increases \u0027people need the skills to question and make judgements about their online environment\u0027, Ofcom warned.The secret to happiness?

It was a defensive fortress built by William I (reign, 1066-1087) circa 1086 to guard the Thames valley against any marauding Saxons bold enough to challenge his supremacy. He chose the commanding spot on top of a 100ft cliff overlooking the River Thames which provided easy access to the capital. William first built up a mound of earth to create an artificial hill and then erected a wooden palisade (staked structure) above it. At the base was a ditch, which could be filled with water if necessary, as a defensive measure. Surrounding the base, within the lower walls, was the bailey. Beyond the walls lay several homesteads, which may have acted as a gatehouse, along with several fields for the rearing of livestock. The site had a large staff of servants and defenders and also served as a marketplace for the townspeople, which created growth in the area. The main route from the fort led down to the river for the transportation of goods for trading in London. All that remains of this structure today is the mound on which Windsor Castle\u0027s iconic Round Tower stands          THE CASTLE DURING THE SIEGE OF 1216.

This artist\u0027s impression shows the room being prepared for the Garter feast of April 28, 1476, during the reign of Edward IV (1461–83). The room was probably quite plain, but when the court was in residence it was transformed with rich wall hangings, furniture and gold and silver plate. Here, the wall hangings are decorated with the motif of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain, founded by Edward III at Windsor          PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROSE TOWER, 1366: Edward III (reign, 1327–77) - the \u0027warrior\u0027 king - is best known for his lengthy campaigns in France during the Hundred Years War. He spent £50,000 transforming Windsor into a Gothic palace, rebuilding the Castle\u0027s Upper Ward to include square towers and high octagonal stair turrets. This illustration shows the small octagonal \u0027Painted Chamber\u0027 of the Rose Tower (today known as King John\u0027s Tower) in Edward III\u0027s day.

Hans Eworth\u0027s Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses, 1569, is thought to include the earliest painted representation of the Castle.During the Civil War of 1642–51, the castle was occupied by Parliamentarians and used as a prison to hold Royalist supporters. Prisoners\u0027 graffiti is still visible today in a room above the Norman Gate.Windsor Castle first became a tourist destination between 1714–76, when the court and royal family rarely visited. Visitors came by coach or barge from London to walk along the terraces, view St George\u0027s Chapel and tour the State Apartments led by the Housekeeper. The first guidebook was introduced in 1749.In 1747, the Italian artist Canaletto visited Windsor to record the castle for Sir Hugh Smithson, one of Canaletto\u0027s most important patrons in England.A 1763 inventory of the Round Tower apartments of the castle\u0027s Constable and Governor, the Earl of Cardigan, includes a room for his servant Ignatius Sancho, a composer, actor and writer. Sancho was the first-known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election and lobbied for abolition of the slave trade.The appearance of the Round Tower dates from the major remodelling of Windsor in the 1820s by George IV. In line with the king’s romantic notion of castle architecture, the tower was heightened by nine metres and given Gothic-style battlements.In June 1887, George Sanger\u0027s travelling circus paraded in the Quadrangle before Queen Victoria and her grandchildren, and gave a performance on the East Lawn. In her journal, the Queen describes 100 horses, 50 ponies, seven elephants, five lions, three camels, a cage of tigers, leopards, a puma, a kangaroo, a monkey, three llamas and an Indian bull.In 1911, Queen Mary persuaded King George V to reintroduce weekly band concerts for the public, which had last taken place at the castle during George III\u0027s reign.In 1924, Queen Mary was presented with a dolls\u0027 house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a gift from the nation. After its display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, the miniature house was installed permanently at the castle.During the Second World War, the Royal Archives were evacuated from the Round Tower to an underground space beneath the castle known as the South Bowe. In addition to being an official royal residence and one of the principal homes of the Royal Family, Windsor Castle encompasses St George\u0027s Chapel and has been home to the College of St George since 1348.

Exclusive talks with Elliott began in late January. Mamut’s firm, Lynwood Investments, which has owned Waterstones since 2011, will retain a minority stake in the business. The deal is expected to be completed in early May.Daunt hailed the acquisition was “definitely a good thing” for the chain, a vindication of “good old-fashioned bookselling”, stressing that there were no closures or job cuts planned as a result. “Quite the opposite – we’re very much in expansion mode, we’re opening up new shops,” he said.“By the end of the year we’ll have more shops not less, and next year an awful lot more shops … For the last year we’ve been pretty distracted with this whole process but have managed to keep going at a reasonable clip – hopefully we will now get on with it with a bit more focus. There’s plenty of room to grow – there are plenty of very nice towns and high street and even shopping centres which don’t have bookshops and should, and we will be very happy to put them there.”Paul Best, head of European private equity at Elliott, which has funds under management of around $35bn (£25bn), said the firm would be “supporting James Daunt and his entire team over the long term as they continue to build and grow the business”.“As the leading physical book retailer in the UK, Waterstones is a mainstay of UK high streets and has a huge and loyal customer base,” said Best.After the demise of household names such as Borders, Dillons and Ottakars, Waterstones’ almost 300 shops make it the only specialist bookseller on the UK high street with the scale to challenge the might of Amazon. When Mamut acquired Waterstones from HMV in 2011, for £53m, the chain had not made an annual profit since 2008. He brought in Daunt, the founder of the independent London book chain Daunt Books, to run the company. Daunt has taken a hands-off approach, allowing local shops to develop their own ranges and displays rather than dictating a uniform approach from head office. In 2016 Waterstones made its first annual profit since 2008, after Mamut invested around £100m in the business, and as physical book sales saw a resurgence and ebooks plateaued.Daunt said today that the chain “would have gone under” without Mamut’s 2011 intervention. “Come 2015 when ebooks started to drop away again, we began to really prosper,” he said, “but it took nerve.”“Most ‘proper books’ are sold at Waterstones on the high street, and if you didn’t have Waterstones you’d have very few independents – lovely independents, but very few, not giving much access to books to many. And then you’d have Amazon, which is a very different sort of a place, no curation, no selection, no championing of authors and inidual books, and without it the trade as a whole would be a very much less vibrant place.”According to the award-winning novelist Jeanette Winterson, bookshops aren’t just selling “stuff”, they’re selling “soul”.“That’s why readers resisted the e-format,” she told the , “and why the non-readers who predicted the end of print couldn’t understand that the physical object of a book is so much more to a reader than just format.”Bookshops are a “civilising presence” on the high street, she continued. “There is more to life than fast food, fast fashion and pound shops. For me, a bookshop is about different values, about the life of the mind, and a cultural space too. The best bookshops around the world are run or owned by book lovers. If Waterstones messes with that simple truth it will fold.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309fc9b1fc861a48565441e6512ff071a5d31b44/0_168_5029_3017/master/5029.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dc04dce05a784d62cff226e0c76984d","title":"homebase sales plunge 20 after beast from the east froze garden sales","story":"Late winter weather deepens DIY chain’s woes with furniture and plant sales hammeredPerth-based Wesfarmers said the cold snap had played havoc with demand for plants and garden furniture, resulting in a fresh setback for the struggling chain. Wesfarmers had planned to convert the chain into an outpost of its successful domestic chain Bunnings, which, in Australia at least, is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. So far only 23 of Homebase’s 250 stores have been converted to the Australian brand and it is unclear whether the group will continue with the costly refurbishments.Earlier this year the Wesfarmers managing director, Rob Scott, said the conglomerate was considering pulling out of the UK after what has been billed as one of the most disastrous retail takeovers ever seen. In February, Scott said the group was writing off A$1bn (£543m) after bungling the 2016 takeover.Wesfarmers bought Homebase for £340m two years ago but it is now understood to be considering offering more than £100m to find a buyer. Another option would be to pursue a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure being used by New Look and Carpetright to dump loss-making stores.The collapse in Homebase sales has in part been self-inflicted after the original Australian management team axed senior managers and key departments, including home furnishings, which had appealed to British shoppers. The former B\u0026ampQ executive Damian McGloughlin has been drafted in to run the chain.The Bunnings group managing director, Michael Schneider, said it was making “satisfactory” progress on several Homebase projects focused on areas such as improving store standards, ranges and promotions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d64993246c7c509c27c2c2fbb81bbfbe7318e0/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6a8e30079b505f0345fab0bd2229615","title":"how has the brexit vote affected the economy april verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and trade in the UK•Interest rate rise clouds outlook•Experts debate the dataWhat’s bad for the pound is good for the FTSE 100 because many of the companies in the index make substantial profits in dollars and export around the globe. The weak pound, which is a boon for these firms, has helped the index of bluechip British shares rise by almost 400 points over the past month. Fears over a potential trade war between China and the US rattled markets earlier in the month but a softer tone from Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has placated investors.The spectre of a damaging global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could dent the ambition of leading Brexiters to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world after the UK leaves the EU. For now, despite the warning signs, there was better news last month in the narrowing UK trade deficit. The trade deficit highlights the difference between what Britain sells abroad and what it imports. In February, this narrowed to £10.2bn, down from £12.2bn in January. There were signs that the freezing weather and heavy snow early last month brought the UK economy to a standstill, raising questions over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May. Barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The IHS MarkitCIPS all sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.1, down from 54.2 on a gauge where a reading of 50 splits the difference between expansion and contraction.

Philip Hammond received good news from the public finances last month, with figures showing the UK budget deficit had narrowed to the lowest annual level since the financial crisis. According to the ONS, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by £3.5bn to £42.6bn in the last financial year – making 2017-18 the best year for the budget deficit since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and what it receives from taxes was £2.6bn lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Meanwhile, the chancellor had hinted during the spring statement he could raise spending in the autumn budget should the public finances remain on track. Brexit uncertainty is weighing heavily on the UK property market, where house price growth has slowed across the country and in reverse in London. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed demand from buyers fell for the 12th consecutive month in March, coupled with the seventh month in a row for fewer new instructions from sellers. Meanwhile, official figures from the ONS showed the first annual fall for house prices in London since the depths of the last recession in 2009.

Can you edit a video? These were two of the questions that came to me when I heard news of anxious debate over the fact that some schools were switching to digital clocks in exam halls because “teenagers cannot tell the time”.The story came about after comments from a former headteacher, Malcolm Trobe, now deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, who said “the current generation aren’t as good at reading the traditional clock face as older generations”. To help minimise stress in important exams, he has suggested switching to digital clocks.As a maths teacher and a parent, I know that one of the requirements in the key stage 1 curriculum is for children to be taught how to read a traditional clock face. On questioning friends, teachers and students, I found few don’t achieve this. That older students might be finding calculating the time they have left in exams difficult is thus more likely about practice. For most pupils – and adults too – digital displays are simply more common, whether on train platforms, computer screens or mobile phones.Trobe’s comments don’t appear to be backed up by any large-scale study, so I will offer the results of my own, rather unscientific, survey: although a couple got the time wrong before correcting themselves, all the teenagers I spoke to were able to read an analogue clock perfectly well. However, for many this wasn’t an embedded reflex – doing so required a level of thought akin to performing a calculation. They get there, but they have to think about it.It therefore seems sensible for Trobe to suggest that, when students are meant to be focusing all their thinking on answering exam questions, they are shown the time in the way they are most familiar with.However, this still leaves us with the deeper question as to why this change in timekeeping technology has caused such a furore. Nobody is suggesting that children have no idea what time is the sense of outrage seems to be because the devices children are using aren’t the ones in common use 40 years ago.I experienced the same exasperation when I was at school and my maths teacher discovered that none of us could use a slide rule. I remember the sneering dismissal of us as hopelessly stupid, the sigh that worried what the world was coming to.In fact, when taught, we picked up the method quickly enough and enjoyed the nostalgic feel of using an “old” tool. But did we deem it a necessary skill to master and put to daily use? No.This is what gave rise to my questions. How many of those now huffing about pupils so dim they can’t read a clock face could themselves still calculate in pre-decimal currency, use an abacus, or calculate their longitude using a sextant? All these once-essential skills have fallen into disuse not because we have become more stupid, but because our tools have become more sophisticated.I also wonder if those complaining would be able to throw together a film with fades, dissolves and subtitles. All my students are fluent with such tools, which leave many of their parents looking rather dull in comparison.Outrage at the apparent stupidity of millennials and the generations following them has become a trope for certain sections of the press, one that is crass and offensive. As GCSE season arrives I can’t help but think that this storm over clock faces is an early shot in the annual “exams are getting easier” vein.We have been here before. Indignation over such technological change is a generational shibboleth, a means of testing membership of the “proper” world as certain privileged adults have labelled it.Rather than perpetuating a tired struggle about which technologies signify this proper intelligence in those coming after us, what we should celebrate instead is the extraordinary proficiency that our young people are developing with suites of tools so sophisticated they make telling the time seem like child’s play.• Kester Brewin is a maths teacher based in south-east London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e2337ff61a96a00c4c7a9d2d177ada827d8bae/0_121_5676_3406/master/5676.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c41b0cb374033d4b535ac01ff59b332","title":"theresa may go home vans operation vaken ukip","story":"The name is a departure from Home Office protocol, and has some distinctly unsavoury associationsA little-known fact. The pilot scheme to encourage those living illegally in the UK to leave voluntarily was called Operation Vaken. The pilot lasted one month, and took place between 22 July and 22 August 2013 in six London boroughs. The operation was to test the hypothesis that people without leave to remain would depart voluntarily if they were made aware there was “a near and present” danger of being arrested. Operation Vaken is best remembered for the controversial vans carrying the message “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest”, also known as the “Go home” vans.Operation Vaken took many people by surprise, not least in its crude populist approach. But perhaps the most surprising thing about it was its name. Why, of all words, Vaken? After all, we’ve had many operations over the years by the Home Office, police and military, but they’ve usually been given simple names, often taken from nature. So Operation Yewtree investigated the sexual abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and others, Operation Bumblebee was an anti-burglary campaign in the 1990s, Operation Antler was an investigation into alleged malfeasance at Porton Down. We don’t understand the significance of the names attached to the operations for a good reason. There shouldn’t be any. Operation names are intended to be neutral and unrelated to a particular case.Which is where Operation Vaken becomes a little odd. Vaken isn’t an easily recognisable word. Nor is it an English word. Operation names should not stand out. This one does.Operation Vaken was part of the government’s “hostile environment” strategy (first introduced as a phrase by Labour home secretary Alan Johnson, then heartily championed by Theresa May in her six years at the Home Office). The evaluation report on the pilot, published in October 2013, stated: “There have been 60 voluntary departures which we believe can be directly attributed to Operation Vaken.” The report also identified a further 65 cases that were “currently being progressed to departure”.Like much Home Office policy, it appeared to be a response to the then growing popularity of Ukip. If the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition was to keep Ukip at bay, it believed it would have to convince voters it was not a soft touch: that it was equally determined to reduce the number of immigrants (the home secretary, Theresa May, was almost obsessively determined to get the figure down to tens of thousands) and had a zero tolerance policy to those who had no right to be in the country.Last week Bob Kerslake, who headed the civil service between 2012 and 2014, said May’s policy at the Home Office was seen by some ministers as “almost reminiscent of Nazi Germany”.Firstly, a short, screening interview is conducted with the applicant, to obtain basic details about the person and their claim.\u0026nbspNext, the person will have their main interview with the Home Office, which tries to deal with straightforward cases within six months, although some people wait for more than a year.Finally, a caseworker will decide on the person\u0027s need for protection based on their interview, supporting documents, and the Home Office\u0027s country guidance about the applicant\u0027s country of origin.The asylum seeker will usually be interviewed at one of 12 regional casework units by a Home Office representative, with an interpreter present if needed.\u0026nbspDuring the interview, the applicant will be asked why they are seeking asylum and about their journey to\u0026nbsp the UK.Incredibly so. The transcript, which is written by the Home Office representative during the interview, becomes the main record of the claim. People are often refused asylum on the basis that there were inconsistencies in their interview, or between their main and screening interviews, which the Home Office will say undermines the person\u0027s credibility. The transcript is also used heavily if the claim is refused and goes to appeal.Miranda Butler, a barrister at 3 Hare Court Chambers in London, calls the interview a totemic piece of evidence. It’s their chance to tell their story. You’ve got to give your claim in a watertight fashion … It’s very difficult to change your account afterwards and if you do people will assume you’re lying.”If someone is granted refugee status or another protection visa, they have the right to live and work in the UK and may be able to bring their spouse and dependent children over to live with them.Which takes us back to the puzzling name. In 2013, sociologists Les Back and Shamser Sinha wrote an article for the political website Open Democracy, revealing that the government has abandoned plans to send the “Go home” vans around the country. Open Democracy asked the Home Office to explain its origin. A spokesman said Home Office operations were named alphabetically, and that Vaken means “awake” in Swedish, but insisted that was not why it was chosen.So are we to believe it is a codename randomly allocated for security purposes? Or is it an esoteric biblical reference in Swedish (“Vaken fördenskull ty I veten icke dagen, ej heller stunden”, or “Wake therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour”, from Matthew 25:13, makes a scary kind of sense)Or is it something even more insidious? Northern European languages often share many old Norse and proto-Germanic roots the word vaken in Swedish (from the old Norse) equates to awake or awaken in English and erwache or erwachen in modern German. It also has symbolic resonance in many languages – not least German. Dietrich Eckart,who has been labelled “the spiritual father of national socialism”, wrote a famous poem in 1922 called Deutschland Erwache (Germany Awake).It is a call to action against infidels. The poem starts “Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm! Storm!  Ring the bells from tower to tower!  Ring until sparks begin to fly,  Judas appears to win the Reich!  Ring until the ropes turn red from blood,  With only burning, torture and murder around,  Ring the storm until the Earth rises  Under the thunder of liberating vengeance!” The poem concludes “Germany, awake! Awake!”That poem Deutschland Erwache was adopted, for many years in the 1920s and 1930s, as the Sturmlied (Storm Song) which became the de facto anthem of the Sturmabteilung, the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi party until supplanted by the Horst-Wessel-Lied. The phrase “Deutschland Erwache” was emblazoned on banners that flew at the Nuremberg rallies. Hitler dedicated the second volume of Mein Kampf to Eckart.Another popular marching song, also called Germany Awake, included the lyrics “All these hypocrites, we throw them out, Judea leave our German house!”.In 2016, in the London Review of Books, the political economist William Davies wrote that he had taken part in a project prompted by Operation Vaken to try to understand how the billboard had come about. He spoke to Home Office civil servants off the record, and revealed that “one former official compared the ethos of the Home Office to that of Millwall football fans: ‘No one likes us, we don’t care.’”Perhaps it was a Home Office official with a similar view who dreamed up the name Operation Vaken. Perhaps it was a Home Office official bitterly opposed to the project who hoped to alert us to the historical precedent. Or perhaps, as the Home Office would doubtless assert, the resemblance between Operation Vaken and Deutchsland Erwache is pure coincidence. But if it is, it’s certainly an unfortunate one.• Simon Hattenstone is a features writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/905435e3e58fda19c03f62a2e91a3c9e1538a1e5/39_0_1682_1009/master/1682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84cdb8218241654ce262b6b829e39a43","title":"theresa may labour customs union","story":"The government is crashing toward the critical stages of Brexit negotiations. In 11 months we leave the EU and enter a transition period. The prime minister can no longer rely on warm platitudes or catchy phrases, but will soon be judged on the reality of the deal she achieves (or worse, the no-deal she ends up with). The success of Brexit now hinges fundamentally on two questions: whether our new relationship with the EU will put the British economy first, and whether the Good Friday agreement, which has brought lasting peace in Northern Ireland, will be respected.To achieve both outcomes, the UK must negotiate a new customs union with the EU. This would ensure that no Northern Irish border is necessary. It would also maintain the frictionless movement of goods into and out of the country, keeping many of the benefits of trade with the EU.It was a former prime minister who once noted how “it is no small thing to have completed and preserved a customs union covering a market of nearly 300 million people”. No, not the words of Tony Blair, nor Harold Wilson, but of Margaret Thatcher. Oddly, this puts the Iron Lady on the same side as Jeremy Corbyn when it comes to this crucial issue of Britain’s future relationship with the EU (though not much else), and on a different side of the argument to Theresa May. By explicitly ruling out such an aspiration in her negotiating stance, May takes a rather lonely perch against this consensus, confined by the ideological whims of the Tory hard-right.This is an unenviable position for the prime minister, who looks increasingly exposed to the judgment of history. Politics is, after all, about building coalitions. This is a point not overlooked by MPs from across the political spectrum, who are coalescing around a motion that calls for the government to accede to Labour’s demand for a customs union. The benefits of Labour’s position are so many that most MPs now find it impossible to disagree that it is the only route forward. The motion has found signatories from almost all parties, and was tabled by the chairs of every select committee in the Commons. It leaves those who support British isolation after Brexit looking rather isolated themselves.Should this cross-party coalition win the vote today it would be yet another symbol of a widening split between parliament and the government over May’s Brexit approach. We have seen the government defeated three times in the Lords, including on the question of a customs union. With legislation still going through the Commons on our future relationship, it seems the voice of parliament will be respected. The case is now overwhelming. The government must back Labour’s position of negotiating a new customs union with the EU, as outlined in full by Corbyn at the beginning of this year, and by Thatcher 40 years earlier.• Peter Dowd is shadow chief secretary to the Treasury"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fca06268716cb2f59d61d2ba9298373f9151653/0_115_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12fd892429142c342c46f3231f21ae14","title":"the sun bust in britain male cleavage","story":"Every morning I sit down with my coffee and read a stack of newspapers (what can I say? I’m old school). A few weeks ago I spotted something in the Sun that made my heart sink. The newspaper had launched Bust in Britain 2018, its annual search to find the nation’s “cleavage queen”. In honour of the competition, the Sun dedicated a full page of the paper to some of the “best” entries this year.It’s hard not to conclude that, according to the Sun, you have to be a skinny white woman with long, straight hair and giant boobs to be beautiful. Everyone else need not apply. Each day I flip through the paper and the top contenders for this year’s prize look pretty much the same. I’ve counted one woman of colour who has featured in its photo spreads over the past month. I happen to tick one of the Sun’s beauty boxes (big boobs), but that’s it. If they are right, I’m too tall, too black and too curly-haired to be beautiful.For years, as an overweight, geeky teenager, I believed messages such as that. I tried every diet under the sun (cabbage soup, Atkins, GI), felt crap about myself when I looked in the mirror without makeup, and straightened my hair every day. (It’s type 3 so, believe me, getting the curl out was a constant challenge.) It took me well over a decade to realise this was a lie, that plenty of people find you attractive if you don’t look like a Page 3 girl. And that I can find myself attractive without dropping three dress sizes. Now I keep my hair natural, wear clothes I like, rather than ones that make me look slim, and I’m not afraid for people to see my face without eyeliner.The Sun likes to pit people who criticise Bust in Britain against the women who enter it. So let me be clear: my problem isn’t with people who want to win £5,000 and a trip to Ibiza (honestly, who doesn’t?). All the women featured in the Sun have the right to enter the contest, and all of them look gorgeous. My problem is with the not-so-subtle message the paper’s editors send when they promote the contest to readers: if you don’t look like them, you need not apply.The good news is, I’ve checked the rules – and Bust in Britain has no restrictions on gender. So this year, Level Up is encouraging men and non-binary people to apply. We asked our male supporters to submit cleavage selfies to get the ball rolling. The results are quite something.It matters when papers such as the Sun promote outdated ideas about beauty. Whether or not you read it, it is a part of British culture its editors have a powerful platform and millions of readers.Right now the message they are sending to people of colour, men and non-binary people who buy the paper is that they aren’t attractive and no one wants to see their boobs. That’s not true in 2018.Too often I see something sexist in the media, roll my eyes and turn the page. But this stuff seeps into our brains. It’s the reason so many of us, and so many young girls, have a negative body image. And it’s not that hard to change.Level Up is a feminist community for all the people who are tired of sexism in the UK and are ready to take action to change things. All genders are welcome, and anyone can join. If you want to support our campaign, you can submit a body-positive selfie today.

The bid has come from Shahid Khan, the owner of Fulham and the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars.Khan is understood to have offered around £500m to purchase the national stadium and under the deal the FA would retain the rights to Club Wembley, its debenture and hospitality business, understood to be worth around £300m.The FA Cup final and semi-finals would stay at Wembley if a deal with Khan, which is said to be in its early stages, goes through. It is understood the FA would be keen for the stadium’s name to continue to include the word Wembley under the terms of any sale.The money from a deal would be ploughed back into grassroots football by the FA, notably on pitches. If the governing body accepts Khan’s offer, it would clear its remaining debt from the rebuilding of the stadium and free the FA from the financial burden of running Wembley.The stadium cost around £830m to rebuild, considerably above the projected amount. The FA said in a statement: “We can confirm that the FA has received an offer to buy Wembley Stadium.”Khan stressed that Wembley would remain “home to the England national teams” and that Fulham would stay at Craven Cottage in a message to the club’s fans. “The Football Association would be able to focus on its core mission of developing players with the best player developers and facilities anywhere in the game, thanks in part to the vast financial benefit that would result from the transaction,” he said. “I trust many, if not most of you, are also supporters of the England national teams, so I hope you welcome the potential of this becoming a reality. Always know Wembley would be home to the England national teams, and that we would strive every day of the year to be the best possible steward for a venue that is iconic and beloved here and throughout the world.Jacksonville would play NFL games at Wembley if Khan buys the stadium. Mark Waller, the NFL’s executive vice-president of events and international, said: “We are very happy for Shad Khan and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The potential purchase of Wembley stadium is a further powerful sign of their commitment to the UK and their vision to help us grow the sport.“Having stadium options in London has always been critical to the NFL and, in tandem with our 10-year partnership with Tottenham Hotspur, this new relationship would allow for even greater flexibility in scheduling future NFL games in London.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17eafc533b9111b866ae19f168b992994d0b2227/0_59_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df87b551db14e1116899e1a19b4b216","title":"gareth bale real madrid frustrated stay bayern munich","story":"• Bale was an unused substitute at Bayern Munich on Wednesday• Forward happy at the club and determined to fight for his placeGareth Bale is extremely frustrated with his lack of playing time at Real Madrid but remains happy at the club and has no plans to push for a move.Bale was an unused substitute on Wednesday at Bayern Munich, where Real Madrid won 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final, raising renewed questions about his long-term future at the Bernabéu. Lucas Vázquez and Isco were selected ahead of Bale, while Marco Asensio – who came on at the start of the second half and scored the winning goal – and Karim Benzema were preferred as attacking options from the bench.Bale is bitterly disappointed to be out of the team and it is starting to appear he does not fit into Zinedine Zidane’s plans, but sources close to the player insist he is determined to fight for his place and has no interest in pursuing a move at the end of the season. The 28-year-old has a lucrative contract that runs until 2022, is settled in Madrid with his family and loves playing for the club.Zidane said after the Bayern game that he would be “relying” on Bale in the weeks to come, yet it felt significant the manager made three substitutions without calling on the Welshman, especially after the quarter-final second leg against Juventus, when Bale was withdrawn at half-time. There is a school of thought that Zidane – who is expected to retain his job irrespective of whether Madrid win the Champions League – prefers attacking players who are more defensive-minded than Bale.Even if Bale does become available this summer, there are doubts whether a Premier League club would be able to match his financial package. Manchester United have long appeared to be Bale’s most likely suitors in England, with the club indicating towards the end of last year they were determined to sign him and were not put off by his injury problems. However that trail appears to have gone cold for now, perhaps because of the arrival of Alexis Sánchez in January.Either way, Bale is understood to be thinking only of playing for Madrid and trying to help the club he joined in 2013 for a then world-record fee win a third successive Champions League."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/785ac6d599f5b71769386ef68dd1cae0a71ffa17/0_128_3854_2312/master/3854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12b0504ad4a1eeca16f82115ec6fa0f2","title":"world cup fiver here come the belgians again","story":"Sign up for our free weekly email featuring the latest news, intrigue, analysis and blunders from the 32 competing nationsIf history teaches us anything, it is that teams lumbered with the ‘Golden Generation’ tag can usually be expected to indulge in pre-tournament hubris, lose their best player to serious knack before a ball’s been kicked, take a work experience kid along as one of their strikers, forget to put the right people in the right positions, chop and change systems from one match to the next, grind out a couple of miserable wins, stink the place out, lose on penalties and end up praying that a foreigner can take some of the blame.

They’re unbeaten in 472 matches, won’t have to face any striker as potent as Hal Robson-Kanu this time, Marouane Fellaini is ready to assume Andrés Iniesta’s mantle as the silkiest midfielder in Europe and even The Fiver is familiar with most of their squad, so they must be doing something right.Other than a row over the lyrics in a proposed and thankfully cancelled Ethics World Cup song, things appear to be falling into place.

Which is where the sense of unease comes in. For while outsiders expect Belgium to do well, regular watchers of the Red Devils aren’t quite as convinced. For starters they lack World Cup pedigree, having failed to produce much of note since a fourth-placed finish in 1986, while there are also doubts over tactics used by Bobby M, a man who is only marginally more popular than Sam Allardyce with Everton supporters and who once tried to build a defence around Antolín Alcaraz. There are fears that a 3-4-3 system will expose Yannick Carrasco’s defensive naivety at left wing-back and while Bob can choose from some classy centre-backs, Toby Alderweireld is looking rusty after falling out of favour at Tottenham. “It’s been a concern,” he said on Monday - and if a man who once labelled Gareth Barry “one of the best English players ever” is low on optimism, then it’s surely only a matter of time before the curse of the Golden Generation tag takes hold.

We ask because a detail about sandwiches was one of the odder elements of a story about a Westminster security alert.A woman accused of meeting men via a “sugar daddy” website while working for parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, has exactly the same thing for lunch every day: a Pret a Manger chicken caesar and bacon baguette, with a pot of fruit and the same smoothie.But is this really that unusual?The statistics we have on how people choose to eat lunch at work are usually gathered by surveys, which can be unreliable, but all the indicators are that a significant proportion of the UK workforce eat the same thing for lunch every day. Whole Foods Market carried out a similar exercise four years earlier. It found that a third of Britons ate the same lunch daily, and half said they had been doing so for six years. Cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches are apparently the favourites of a nation stuck in a lunchtime rut. There are upsides to repetitive eating. There’s a theory that because you become subconsciously bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. It can also help with budgeting: those purchasing the same thing each day can anticipate exactly how much they are going to spend on lunches. Another reason to stick to what you know might be to do with allergies – repeatedly ordering the same thing avoids the risk of unexpected ingredients. This may not be the case with Raab’s sandwich, however, since it contains seven items listed by Pret as possible allergens: gluten, sesame seeds, dairy, egg, celery, mustard and fish.Still, regardless of what you have for lunch at work, your habits will never be as eyebrow-raising as the man who claims he eats Christmas dinner every single day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8908436488bf99f8f3659b3ecfc42a57d3626829/892_1454_6214_3728/master/6214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704f47910abfed3ef413be0dbe1a98c0","title":"no stir risotto recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"Think risotto is all about endless stirring? Think again…I’m going to let you in on a little secret: despite what every nonna and Italian cookbook will tell you, you don’t need to chain yourself to the hob to make a decent risotto. The method below, which involves a mere two minutes of stirring, comes from a fourth-generation rice grower from the Veneto. And if it’s good enough for him …125ml white wine550ml stock3 tbsp butter ½ onion, peeled and chopped200g risotto rice, carnaroli or vialone nano ideally, though arborio will do25g parmesan, gratedBring the wine and 400ml of the stock to a simmer (chicken or vegetable are the most versatile, but ham, fish or beef may work better, depending on your choice of ingredients: if you’re using a stock pot or cube, which can be salty, taste and dilute as necessary before use). Red wine is sometimes used for risottos featuring beef or sausages.Over a medium-low heat, melt two tablespoons of the butter in a wide, shallow pan for which you have a lid (a wide pan means that more of the rice will come into contact with the stock, so it will cook more evenly). If you’re making a seafood risotto, or would simply prefer to keep the dish dairy-free, use extra-virgin olive oil instead.Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until it’s soft and golden make sure it doesn’t brown. Depending on what kind of risotto you’re making, once the onion has begun to soften, you could also chuck in finely chopped garlic, carrot, celery or pancetta, but leave any fresh herbs and other delicate ingredients until the end.Turn up the heat slightly and tip in the rice. Stir to coat with the butter and fry until it’s hot to the touch, without letting it colour. Use arborio rice, if that’s all you can find, but carnaroli and vialone nano are starchier, more robust varieties that are harder to overcook, so will produce a creamier result.Pour in the hot stock and wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and leave to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes – a good time for the cook to pour a glass of wine and put your feet up: once you’ve warmed the remaining stock, cut the rest of the butter into pieces and grated the cheese, that is.After 15 minutes, the rice should be almost tender, with just a hint of bite, and have absorbed all the cooking liquid. Add the butter (or oil) and the remaining 150ml stock to the pan, then stir for a couple of minutes, until the risotto is creamy but the consistency is still fairly loose.Stir in the grated parmesan (or pecorino, or any hard, dry cheese, or leave it out altogether, if you prefer, or if you’re making a seafood risotto). Either way, turn off the heat, cover the pan again and leave to sit for two minutes, then season to taste (a touch of nutmeg works well) and serve.This basic risotto is delicious on its own, or with cooked veg stirred through it (I had mine with wilted spinach and baked squash), but it’s easy to adapt. A classic Milanese risotto, say, is made with beef stock and a good pinch of saffron (add it to the final 150ml stock as it warms) and served alongside osso buco.Mushroom risotto can be made along the same lines, with meat or vegetable stock and the soaking liquid from dried porcini. As can, in just a few weeks’ time, asparagus risotto made with vegetable or chicken stock and a glug of asparagus cooking water. Note that fragile ingredients such as asparagus or seafood are best cooked separately and stirred into the risotto just before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee5ee9148d84c471ec250f1160c9d58d3b47b605/170_107_3503_2101/master/3503.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29a50f2e53dede72e966c821ecfa8f68","title":"kate bush makes second tribute to emily bronte with art installation","story":"Carol Ann Duffy, Jeanette Winterson and Jackie Kay also set to celebrate Brontë sisters’ legacyKate Bush is to make her second tribute to Emily Brontë, providing words for a permanent art installation on the wiley, windy moors that inspired Wuthering Heights.Bush will join the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy, the Scottish makar, or national poet, Jackie Kay and the novelist Jeanette Winterson in a summer project celebrating the Brontë sisters. All four have been commissioned to write a piece of poetry or prose which will then be engraved on stones positioned over the eight-mile route between the sisters’ birthplace and the family parsonage.Winterson will celebrate the Brontë legacy as a whole, Duffy will celebrate Charlotte, Kay has Anne and Bush has Emily.The Brontë stones project takes place in the bicentenary year of Emily’s birth and, appropriately, the 40th anniversary year of Bush’s Wuthering Heights, the mindblowing song she released when she was just 18 years old.Bush said she was delighted to be involved in the project. “Each sister being remembered by a stone in the enigmatic landscape where they lived and worked is a striking idea. “Emily only wrote the one novel – an extraordinary work of art that has truly left its mark. To be asked to write a piece for Emily’s stone is an honour and, in a way, a chance to say thank you to her.”The writers have been commissioned by Bradford literature festival, which will unveil the stones in July. Getting Bush involved is a real coup. While not, in her words, the “weirdo recluse” she is sometimes portrayed as, Bush avoids the limelight. She rarely gives interviews. When, out of the blue, she announced a series of live shows in 2014, her first for 35 years, the news made headlines around the world.The festival’s director, Syima Aslam, said Bush had been approached with a degree of trepidation. “We saw it as such a good fit, but equally we were, ‘she might just say no’. But you won’t know unless you ask … and she said yes, which was tremendously exciting.”The stones project is the only way Bush will be marking the 40th anniversary of her song.Aslam said the Charlotte stone will be at the house where the Brontës, including their wayward brother Branwell, were born in the village of Thornton. Anne’s stone will be in a meadow beside the parsonage in Haworth, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, where the family grew up. The Emily and Brontë legacy stones will be in the landscape.Putting the Emily stone on the wild and exposed moors was not a difficult decision to take. “There was no other way of doing it,” said Aslam. “I remember a long time ago being laughed at by a friend as we were driving through the moors and I said, ‘It’s all so bleak, it reminds me of Wuthering Heights’. She just looked at me and laughed.”Aslam said it had been important to get a northern writer to celebrate the Brontë legacy and was thrilled that Winterson said yes.Winterson recalled growing up in Lancashire and roaming the hills in the rain and feeling both passionate and misunderstood. “I read the Brontës and felt their spirit stand by me,” she said. “The Brontës showed me that hearts beat like mine, that the struggle to know who you are happens across time and generations, and gender. “They showed me that writing needs the power of the personal behind it – but that somehow the story one person tells has to become a story many people can claim as their own. And the Brontës are women. As a woman I needed those ancestors, those guides. I still do.”Aslam said the calibre of the writers was important. “It has just been perfect. I could not have asked for anything more. These are writers who will be remembered. As much as the stones will be a way in to the work of the Brontës, they will also be a way into these writers as well.”Michael Stewart, who lives in Thornton, came up with the idea in 2013. He said he had long wanted “my village to receive recognition for its place in the Brontë story … It’s fantastic to see the project come to fruition”.Stewart will lead a guided walk between Thornton and Haworth, titled In the Footsteps of the Brontës, on 8 July. The day before, Duffy, Kay and Winterson will be in Bradford to inaugurate the stones and read their words."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab82f263bb0ab1ca60c737448391ed26e0ceb231/0_0_3500_2323/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1c7e9426e6e54cc014605daea45462f 700w","title":"amber rudd admits home office set local targets for deportations","story":"Labour calls on home secretary to quit after she admits existence of targets, having previously said her department did not set themAmber Rudd faced fresh calls to resign after admitting the Home Office set strict local targets for removing migrants who were in the UK illegally, having previously told MPs her department did not set targets.The home secretary was hauled back in front of MPs in the House of Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour’s Diane Abbott, after Home Office documents revealed targets were set for voluntary removals.MPs have said the targets could have led enforcement officers to target “low-hanging fruit” – people living in the UK legally but without the correct documents, like many of the Windrush generation.Rudd said the Home Office had been “using local targets for internal performance management” but said she would review them. “I have never agreed there should be specific removal targets and I would never support a policy that puts targets ahead of people,” she said. “These were not published targets against which performance was assessed. But they were used inappropriately. I am clear they will have to change.”Rudd said she had requested a full briefing on how performance was assessed, including the use of targets, and that she would update MPs afterwards. “I do not want us to be run by a target culture. I want to make sure the inidual is at the heart of any decision,” she said. Asked by Labour MP Rachel Maskell who was running the department if Rudd did not know about the targets, the home secretary said: “I accept the criticism on the issue ... that’s why I’m in the house today setting out the changes I’m going to make ... to continue to develop the confidence of everybody involved.”Abbott said the revelations were part of a long-running saga of Home Office mistreatment of migrants, including the Windrush families. “Isn’t it time the home secretary considered her honour and resigned?” she said.Other Labour and SNP MPs echoed calls for Rudd’s resignation but her position was bolstered by Tory MPs who turned out in force to support her. Cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Sajid Javid sat beside her on the frontbench for her statement. Conservative MP Nicholas Soames said Rudd had “the total support of this side of the house in trying to resolve a very difficult legacy issue” to cheers from other Tory MPs.Pressed by Labour’s Paula Sherriff, Rudd said she did not intend to step aside. “I do take seriously my responsibility but I do think I am the person who can put it right,” she said. Rudd’s appearance in the Commons followed an appearance before the home affairs select committee, where she was asked whether her department had regional targets, after an immigration union official claimed they existed.Rudd said she was not familiar with the suggestion that regional targets were in place. “We don’t have targets for removals … If you are asking me if there are numbers of people we expect to be removed, that’s not how we operate,” she said. The Home Office immigration chief, Glyn Williams, also told MPs that targets did not exist.However, an inspection report from 2015 seen by the  reveals that the Home Office set a target in 2015 of 12,000 voluntary departures of people regarded as having no right to stay in the UK. It is not clear whether the target is still in force.Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee, said it was “deeply disappointing that the home secretary did not know the facts” when she spoke to the committee on Wednesday. Theresa May’s spokesman insisted removal targets was a concept which “goes back over a number of decades”, and cited ones imposed by Labour governments from 1998 to 2010, although these were aimed at more specific areas such as asylum seekers and foreign prisoners.Asked if May supported the principle of targets, he said: “Dealing with issues of illegal immigration and taking enforcement action has been a priority for a succession of governments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a4fd14ae39362a98588f7e5884ab2bfa17d92c8/169_0_1999_1199/master/1999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fadd6b6191a3fb4fc3225c11d8a432d","title":"amber rudd makes a staggering admission over immigration targets","story":"The home secretary’s belated acknowledgement suggests she was oblivious to the workings of her own department“I don’t know what you’re referring to,” said Amber Rudd, the home secretary, as she was quizzed on Wednesday over the existence of targets for removing migrants from the country.Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, could barely contain her incredulity. Moments earlier, the head of the the union for immigration workers had confirmed there were net targets for removing illegal immigrants.So did the home secretary mislead the committee? Or is she oblivious to her department’s workings?Come Thursday morning, it appeared to be the latter. “The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management,” she revealed in a staggering admission to the House of Commons in response to an urgent question.At the committee hearing, there was a suggestion Rudd had no grasp of her department’s workings.“I didn’t hear that testimony, I’m not sure what shape that might be in,” Rudd said in reference to the existence of targets.Here’s what shape it might have been in. There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportation is a specific term that applies to people and their children whose removal from the country is deemed “conducive to the public good” by the home secretary. It can also be recommended by a court. Administrative removals or removals refer to a larger set of cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or otherwise violated the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK. Finally, we come to voluntary departures. Crucially, these iniduals are still people against whom enforced removal has been initiated. The term “voluntary” simply describes how they depart. Within this category, are three sub-layers: those who depart by assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes, those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities, and those who leave without notifying the government.It did not take long for evidence of departure targets to emerge. In 2015, David Bolt, an inspector whose job it is to scrutinise the work of the immigration and borders system governed by the Home Office, published a report on enforced removals. Within the publicly available report, there are a number of references to targets. The key paragraph, 4.16, states:“For 2014-15, the Home Office set a target of 7,200 voluntary departures, an average of 120 per week, with the weekly target rising to 160 by the end of March 2015. For 2015-16, the annual target was raised to 12,000. These targets were split between the 19 ICE teams across the UK.”In black and white in Bolt’s report, a clear reference to targets for “voluntary departures”. Not a reference, technically, to administrative removals, but a departure target nonetheless.But crucially Lucy Moreton, the head of the Union for Borders, Immigration and Customs, said the target culture in the immigration operations had trickled down from the headline “net migration target” that Theresa May, the prime minister, has so obstinately kept in place.It is important to make clear the target to reduce net migration – the difference between those leaving and arriving – to less than 100,000 (the most recent estimate puts the figure at 244,000) does not relate to illegal migration. But it was launched in 2010 amid growing fears over the rise of Ukip and against a backdrop of ramped-up anti-immigration rhetoric, the same backdrop against which May unleashed her hostile environment policy in the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts to tackle illegal immigration. And that brings us back to the Windrush scandal. The jobs lost, the healthcare refused, the bank accounts decimated – lives of those with the right to be in the UK ruined by a policy targeted at illegal immigrants, built on an ideological pursuit of political targets.

Such athletes, including Semenya, will have to reduce and then maintain their testosterone levels to no greater than 5nmolL by 1 November if they want to compete in events ranging from 400 metres to a mile.The move, which is sure to ide opinion, was unanimously approved by the IAAF council last month. According to the world-renowned sports scientist Ross Tucker, the effect will be significant on athletes such as Semenya. “If this policy passes, then I would predict that Semenya will be five to seven seconds slower over 800 metres,” he wrote.“The other really interesting thing is that, guided by the new IOC transgender policy that lowers the upper limit for testosterone to 5nmolL, the IAAF are setting their limit at 5nmolL. It used to be 10. That will slow the times of these athletes down even more than it did in the past.”He told the : “History suggests Semenya will lose about four seconds to five seconds. Because in 2013 and 2014, when the IAAF were diligent about ensuring her compliance with the upper limit at that time (10nM), she was running 2:00. I don’t think she even qualified for the Commonwealth Games. Now, at 5nM, that effect will be even larger, I suspect. She will go from a 1:54 to 2:01-2:03, is my estimate.”Semenya burst on to the scene in 2009 when she won the world 800m title but was then required to take testosterone-suppressing medicine by the IAAF in order to compete. However, in July 2015 the court of arbitration for sport reversed that rule when it examined the Dutee Chand case – allowing inter-sex athletes to compete without taking testosterone-suppressing medication.The decisive factor for the Cas panel in 2015 was whether testosterone above the 10nmolL threshold set by the IAAF gave female athletes a competitive advantage over their fellow competitors. However research by the IAAF since then shows that in certain events testosterone does make an enormous difference. An IAAF report notes that “most females have low levels of testosterone circulating naturally in their bodies (0.12 to 1.79 nmolL in blood) while after puberty the normal male range is much higher (7.7 – 29.4 nmolL). Absent a DSD or a tumour, no female would have serum levels of testosterone approaching 5 nmolL, but iniduals with DSDs can have very high levels of natural testosterone, extending into and even beyond the normal male range.”The IAAF also makes it clear that science is on its side. In its report it writes: “There is a broad medical and scientific consensus that if these iniduals are sensitive to androgens (ie, they have properly-functioning androgen receptors), such very high levels of natural testosterone can increase their muscle mass and strength, as well as their levels of circulating haemoglobin, and so significantly enhance their sporting potential.“This evidence shows clearly that (at least in certain events) DSD athletes with levels of circulating testosterone in the normal male range have a very significant competitive advantage over female athletes with testosterone levels in the normal female range.”“To the best of our knowledge, there is no other genetic or biological trait encountered in female athletics that confers such a huge performance advantage.”In explaining its decision, the IAAF said it was trying to create “a level playing field and ensure that success is determined by talent, dedication, hard work, and the other values and characteristics that the sport embodies and celebrates”.It added: “The IAAF wants athletes to be incentivised to make the huge commitment and sacrifice required to excel in the sport, and so to inspire new generations to join the sport and aspire to the same excellence. It does not want to risk discouraging those aspirations by having unfair competition conditions that deny athletes a fair opportunity to succeed.“Because of the significant advantages in size, strength and power enjoyed (on average) by men over women from puberty onwards, due in large part to men’s much higher levels of circulating testosterone, and the impact that such advantages can have on sporting performance, it is generally accepted that competition between male and female athletes would not be fair and meaningful, and would risk discouraging women from participation in the sport. Therefore, in addition to separate competition categories based on age, the IAAF has also created separate competition categories for male and female athletes.It added: “The IAAF respects the dignity of all iniduals, including iniduals with DSDs. It also wishes the sport of athletics to be as inclusive as possible, and to encourage and provide a clear path to participation in the sport for all. The IAAF therefore seeks to place conditions on such participation only to the extent necessary to ensure fair and meaningful competition.”In a Q\u0026ampA sent out with its new rules, the IAAF also anticipated a frequent argument made in this debate – namely that all elite athletes have natural genetic andor biological advantages (such as height or lung capacity), so why deny DSD athletes the benefit of their natural levels of circulating testosterone?In response the IAAF wrote: “The IAAF ides competition into male and female classifications because male athletes have clear performance advantages in terms of size, strength and power, as a result (in particular) of increased lean body mass and increased serum haemoglobin, which in turn is due mainly to the fact that, starting from puberty, they produce 10‐30 times more testosterone than women. As noted above, the CAS has found that this difference justifies protecting female athletes from competition from male athletes.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6b5260a971ba0da976aa671b857307c26837000/0_129_2966_1780/master/2966.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbadd9d57ebb131e2bef746b12fa8b5","title":"shaquem griffin nfl draft","story":"The linebacker is one of the biggest stories in this year’s draft but he faces unique challenges as he attempts to step up to the professional gameEvery player in this week’s NFL draft has a unique story, a path that brought them, often through challenging circumstances, to professional football. But there hasn’t been a player quite like Shaquem Griffin before. A twin, Griffin was born with an undeveloped left hand caused by amniotic band syndrome, a condition that can result in damaged tissue or, in extreme cases, even fetal death.Griffin later had his hand amputated after the pain led him to try to cut off his own fingers at the age of four. Pushed by his father, Griffin didn’t let his situation hold him back, ending a standout high-school career by making second team All-State in football. While he could have pursued a track scholarship, both Griffin twins, Shaquem and Shaquill, elected to attend the University of Central Florida. There are those who believe Shaquem was signed by UCF solely to make sure the college got the highly rated Shaquill, who now plays for the Seattle Seahawks, and Shaquem initially saw little playing time. It wasn’t until Scott Frost was hired as head coach – after a 0-12 season – that Shaquem got his chance. Named the American Athletic Conference defensive player of the year after his first season as a starter in 2016, Griffin followed that up with All-Conference first-team honors in 2017. Griffin’s first step in convincing evaluators that he can play professionally came at the NFL Combine in March, an invite-only event that has players run, jump and perform position-specific drills. Running the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds, the fastest by a linebacker since 2003, Griffin also used a prosthetic hand to bench press 225lbs 20 times, a solid result. Despite showing game-changing speed, something NFL scouts generally salivate over, Griffin was only rated as a backup or special teams player.NFL evaluators found weaknesses which they believe will push him into the later rounds of the draft, despite his college accomplishments and Combine numbers. For NFL scouts, those limitations primarily relate to his tackling ability: “Griffin’s physical limitation should be discussed as it pertains to areas like tackle disengagement and consistency of finishing, but his instincts, play speed and technique have all been major factors in helping him thrive at his position.”Johnny Nansen, linebackers and assistant head coach for the USC Trojans, says those doubts may be due to the huge step up from college to professional football. “In the NFL, particularly at linebacker, great tackling technique is expected,” says Nansen. “The ball carriers will be faster and stronger than those at the college level, requiring the defensive players to have good technique to bring them to the ground and end the play.”Nansen emphasizes that poor technique not only leads to missed tackles but can result in injury. “A player can be the strongest or fastest guy on the field but if he puts his head down or leaves his feet when tackling, his strength and speed will not mean anything. If he leads with his head, it’s the first thing to make contact and makes concussions and neck injuries much more likely.”Justin Tuck, the former two-time Pro Bowl defensive end for the Giants and Raiders believes Griffin can carve out a solid career. “He proved through his play in college that he has the skills to play the game at a high level,” says Tuck. Though there might be more uncertainty for a player like Griffin – he would be the first in NFL history with one hand – Tuck believes that Griffin could be a steal for a team as a fifth- or sixth-rounder. Four-time Pro Bowler Richard Sherman went even further and wrote on Twitter that if Griffin “doesn’t get drafted in the first two days the system is broken”.“I think the challenging part for him will be the obvious – shedding blocks and tackling NFL caliber athletes,” says Tuck. “He has obviously found a way to overcome this so far though, so it will be exciting to watch him develop even more.”The only player comparable to Griffin, at least as it relates to limitations, is a former team-mate of Tuck’s in New York, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul. Paul lost much of his right hand after a fireworks accident in 2015 and has played portions of the 2016 and 2017 seasons with his hand wrapped up like a club. Pierre-Paul finished last season with eight sacks and 47 tackles.While Pierre-Paul has remained effective with one hand, differences in positional responsibilities make Griffin’s challenges unique. In that respect, Tuck gives the immediate advantage to Griffin. “Though there are similarities, I believe Griffin would have the advantage here because he has dealt with this for far longer than Jason.” However, Tuck also believes that Pierre-Paul will overcome this obstacle as he continues to adapt and learn how to use his hand.The NFL, like any other professional sport, is a results-driven business and players pursue any advantagethey can against an opposing player, something that Tuck envisions happening. “I’m sure many teams will try to attack his left hand and there are many ways that blockers and ball carriers will attack it,” Tuck says. “But if he has been this successful dealing with those same attacks in college, I’m guessing that he has some tricks of his own to combat those attacks and set himself apart.”Historically, NFL talent evaluators tend to shy away from the different – the short quarterback, slow wide receiver, or undersized offensive lineman – afraid to take a chance on a player that doesn’t fit the mold, a factor which works against Griffin. But one aspect of Griffin’s game which can’t be measured at a Combine or Pro Day is his drive and motivation to prove his doubters wrong, a powerful tool that has fueled the ascent of many late-round picks before him. In that, Tuck figures that Griffin isn’t finished. “Griffin has already proven himself with what he has accomplished in college and I’m sure he is extremely motivated to continue proving people wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733f2054114452b2769dc78d93bae93dd3042c3a/55_141_2746_1648/master/2746.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256bb8862dd3e0a28ed90d2b4b0de2b3","title":"tom youngs confident leicester triumph must win newcastle premiership rugby union showdown","story":"Leicester captain says Northampton defeat has made club more determined to maintain record of always qualifying for Premiership play-offs as they prepare for must-win matchLeicester have never failed to qualify for the Premiership play-offs since the current system was introduced in 2005-06, but defeat to Newcastle at Welford Road on Friday night would all but end that record.The Falcons are fourth in the table, two points above Leicester, and their director of rugby, Dean Richards, spent his playing career at Welford Road and became the club’s director of rugby before being fired in the 2003-04 season.Then, as this campaign, Leicester lost four league matches in front of the Welford Road faithful, but if their supporters could pick an opponent for a must-win home game, Newcastle would be high on the list having only won once in the Premiership at Welford Road, back in its inaugural season in 1997, and having mustered only one victory in the last 15 league meetings between the sides.“We are under no illusions, we know we have to win on Friday,” said the Leicester captain, Tom Youngs. “It will be a final every match for us for the rest of the season. We will have to win again at Sale in the final round and that would give us an away semi-final, probably in Exeter, and again we would have to deliver. We know what we have to do and we are confident in our ability.”Leicester would have one foot in the play-offs had they not succumbed to a surprise home defeat to their East Midlands rivals Northampton in the last round, a run of five straight Premiership victories ended by a team whose only away success in the league and Europe this season had been at London Irish.“It was a reality check for us,” said Youngs. “The end of that match was one of the worst feelings I have experienced in a Leicester shirt. There was no complacency, but we were off it mentally and if that happens in the Premiership, which is as tight and competitive as it has ever been, you will invariably lose.The return of Richards, a Leicester icon, will add to the occasion. “He was an awesome player for the club and a great coach,” said Youngs. “He knows what it is all about and they will be well prepared. They are fourth for a reason, because they are a very good side who have done well away this season (six league wins out of 10). They deserve to be up there.”Exeter have secured a home draw in the play-offs and Saracens will do so as well if they win at London Irish on Sunday, but it has been a season when every club has endured at least one stumble. Worcester have spent the campaign trying to finish above Irish, but they won at Leicester and Exeter.“Sometimes the team that you think will win loses,” said Youngs. “That is sport and what makes it so compelling. If it was predictable, no one would watch. The Premiership is a tough, vibrant tournament with every club capable of winning on any given day. Perhaps it has cost us in Europe because no one can afford to rest players ahead of Champions Cup matches, but because strength is spread across the board in our league it makes it tighter. It becomes harder to play in every season.“The Pro 14 is different and player talent is more concentrated. I have been very impressed with Leinster this season and when I saw them win at Exeter, I fancied them to go all the way in the Champions Cup. It should be some final against Racing 92 next month.”Youngs intends to be preparing for a play-off semi-final by the time that match is played. “What we can take from the Northampton game is that we had plenty of chances at the beginning and did not take them,” he said. “The negatives from that day have made us better and even more determined.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b2be40a14d384dcce7c26ec408926705f1f2033/0_309_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ecb013d65c7b1c7082d9104c0f0db6","title":"alexandra palaces hidden theatre to reopen after 188m restoration","story":"Performers to grace the Victorian stage in London after a gap of 80 years, once lottery-funded revamp finishes this summerFor the first time in more than 80 years, regular performances are to be staged at a huge, abandoned, Victorian theatre hidden inside Alexandra Palace, north London.The theatre is being restored with the help of an £18.8m lottery grant – which was one of the biggest ever for a UK heritage project – and the work will near completion over the summer.On Thursday, Alexandra Palace’s charitable trust announced details of the theatre’s opening programme in December, an eclectic line-up that will include a performance by Gareth Malone, Gilbert and George in conversation, an evening of jazz from Ronnie Scott’s, and a run of the Horrible Histories Christmas show. Ahead of that, on 1 September, the Proms will visit with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Trial by Jury.The building will not be a gleaming interior, the trust said. “I describe it as a gentle nudge into the modern era,” said Emma Dagnes, the trust’s deputy chief executive. “We do not want to impact on the space too much because that is not its story. It opened with wonder and spectacle and excitement for the Victorians and, like all theatres, it had an interesting and eclectic history. And then it closed its doors. It would have been wrong to crack open the gold leaf and take it back to a pastiche of its former self.”The theatre opened in 1875 with a performance of Offenbach’s operetta Breaking the Spell. Spectacular pantomimes with huge casts followed, as well as opera, ballet, music hall variety and stage drama, in a space capable of holding an audience of 3,000.During the first world war Alexandra Palace was used as an internment camp for German and Austrian “enemy aliens” and the theatre became the camp’s hospital. After the BBC arrived in the 1930s it was employed as a useful prop store. It was mostly hidden away for 80 years until the restoration project started.Dagnes said it had been important to maintain the scars of the theatre’s dereliction. “We have done a lot of work on the ceiling but we have deliberately taken the decision to not fill in all the holes and make it look perfect. That would have been jarring to the space.”One big change is the raising of the floor by about 3.5 metres in an attempt to make the space more intimate. All the original floorboards were taken up and carefully numbered, and will be put back in precisely the same pattern.The theatre will officially re-open on 1 December with an as yet unnamed performance by a headline act. On 2 December there will be a gala night of music, comedy and circus, compered by Adam Hills.The project, part of a wider £27m restoration of Ally Pally’s east wing, is promoted as being all about channelling the original philosophy of a people’s palace. “The Victorians really understood the importance of culture and entertainment, and recreation and leisure, for the wellbeing of the soul,” said Dagnes. “For me, that’s probably even more important now than it was then. It is such an exciting opportunity to give this back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01dfe987bd4aa911edc417854c1f708fef79ef86/0_18_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a786d61ebd1c820152b95fa74254330","title":"eu third party trader amazon google ebay","story":"Amazon, Google and eBay will be obliged to ensure sellers know how to influence online rankingAmazon, Google and other tech firms will be forced to be more transparent in their dealings with third-party businesses who sell goods on their sites, under a draft EU regulation.Thousands of companies use platforms such as Amazon and eBay to sell goods online, allowing a sole trader working from a garage or kitchen table to reach millions of potential customers.But many complain that the big firms are opaque about their rankings, why some get top billing, while others struggle to be seen by internet browsers. App designers, selling through Google’s Play Store or Apple’s App Store, report similar problems.Under a draft regulation published on Thursday, large tech platforms would be obliged to rewrite their terms and conditions, to ensure third-party sellers know how they can influence their online ranking, for instance whether payment is required for a top spot. Online platforms would also have to give an explanation for a decision to suspend any third-party business from their site and set up a system to handle complaints.EU legislators want to fast-track the law and hope for agreement between European ministers and MEPs in early 2019. Under this timetable, the law would start to affect firms from autumn 2019.“You see things like user conditions being changed from day to day,” said Mariya Gabriel, the European commissioner for digital economy and society. “We are saying to the platforms you need to have transparency with regard to your conditions for use, data access and so on, to provide businesses with the opportunity to know what their criteria are and to create an environment based on rules that everyone is familiar with.”This is only the latest attempt by the EU to regulate online businesses, which have become economic powerhouses, without facing the same constraints as their bricks-and-mortar rivals. Amazon, described by one of its former product managers, as a “great white shark” has grown from an online bookshop to become a vast retail empire, selling groceries, consumer electronics and cloud services. But the European commission thinks that it and other digital giants, such as Google and Apple, do not pay their fair share of taxes.Responding to the latest proposals, the pan-European tech industry group Digital Europe welcomed what it called the commission’s measured approach but urged EU legislators not to introduce further regulatory requirements that it said would hinder innovation and ultimately hurt European businesses and consumers. “We recognise that understanding the functioning of platforms is key to building trust with users,” said Digital Europe’s director general, Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl. “However, any disproportionate requirements, catering to inidual interests, could undermine this growth.”Consumer groups sounded a cautious note. “The EU should go a step further than only demanding platforms to be more transparent,” said Monique Goyens, director general of the European Consumer Organisation. “Being transparent about unfair and discriminatory practices does not correct what is wrong. Platforms should not be allowed to apply tactics that make it more difficult for companies to reach consumers or lead to higher prices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/579444d5a1f0d59505189eceb42c4a1fcec14c75/7_52_2155_1293/master/2155.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bcec7386b0ae579393df71bde40823f","title":"bbc shelves human planet after doubts cast on whale hunting scene","story":"Broadcaster withdraws series from distribution amid doubts over harpooning sceneThe BBC has withdrawn its TV series Human Planet from distribution after finding a second editorial breach in a matter of weeks.Earlier this month the corporation said a scene in one episode showing tribal people living in treehouses had been faked by the programme’s makers. Now, it has said a scene showing a hunter apparently harpooning a whale is not an accurate portrayal of the man’s role.“The BBC has been alerted to a further editorial breach in the Human Planet series from 2011,” it said in a statement. “In episode one, Oceans, a Lamaleran whale hunter named Benjamin Blikololong is shown supposedly harpooning a whale.“On review, the BBC does not consider that the portrayal of his role is accurate, although the sequence does reflect how they hunt whales. The BBC has decided to withdraw Human Planet from distribution for a full editorial review.”It is not the first time the series has been hit by claims of fakery. In 2015 it emerged that a semi-domesticated wolf had been used because the crew had been unable to find a wild wolf on location.

Then inject the drama of an EastEnders Christmas special or the high-energy camp of a panto and cram it all into a sweaty lycra singlet for your nan to scream at. Such a heady combo is akin to the idiosyncratic brilliance of British wrestling at its finest.This week ITV confirmed that World of Sport Wrestling (WoSW) is coming back to the channel for a 10-part series, three decades since the end of its original run. For 20 years, wrestling beamed into the living rooms and went head to head with the BBC, “engaging in a David and Goliath Saturday afternoon battle with Grandstand”. While World of Sport showcased other (arguably more legitimate) competitive endeavours during its Saturday show, it was the 4pm wrestling that really captured the imagination of its audience.In its prime, it drew millions of fans, from small children cheering for the babyfaces to OAPs shaking fists at the heels. It brought people together, and gave them the opportunity to get behind something innocent, eccentric and unmistakably British.In those days, grapplers such as Mick McManus, Klondyke Kate, Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks were household names, with the latter two developing a feud still revered as one of the greatest in wrestling history. When WoSW was dropped in September 1985, wrestlers stepped from the glow of telly limelight, into the social clubs and function rooms. American wrestling continued to thrive on the other side of the pond, with WWF superstars such as Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior taking the sport to a new level. But with little chance of the sport bringing fame and fortune to Brits, the UK scene went underground, with wrestling heroes having normal 9-to-5s, shedding their day-to-day attire for dex and baby oil at the weekends.To be a wrestler, you had to really want it. Those desperate to be at the top of their game evolved their style. Promotions such as Fight Club: Pro are drawing thousands of fans at venues such as Birmingham’s NEC, and PROGRESS is gearing up for its biggest show at the SSE Arena Wembley – playing to passionate audiences. The WWE has seen the UK talent and their potential, giving them a global platform on which to showcase their abilities worldwide. Hardworking Pete Dunne from Birmingham, the fierce Welsh wonder Steffanie “Nixon” Newell, Dudley’s Tyler Bate and Trent Seven, a moustachioed powerhouse from Wolverhampton, are all regulars on the global WWE Network. While hopefuls once dreamed of one day making it to America to compete, now the US is looking to us for the best talent in the world. Popular Netflix series GLOW, a comedy based on the real-life Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling franchise, and movies such as The Wrestler and British wrestling film Walk Like a Panther prove there’s still a wider cultural interest in the sport. Now ITV has potentially found the perfect time to remind the wider, British audience of WoSW magic.Filmed in front of live audiences in Norwich in May, it promises to “combine the best of the past with incredible talent available today”. On New Year’s Eve 2016, the channel screened a one-off episode, testing the water and introducing the nation to stars such as the masked El Ligero, the world-class Viper and reigning champion, man mountain Dave Mastiff.One of the main criticisms levelled at it by living room sceptics was that it wasn’t real, and that the outcome of the bouts are pre-determined. When Giant Haystacks was going at it with Big Daddy, the fact that the matches were a “work” was unknown to most.But turning away from wrestling for being fake is as ludicrous as writing off a Steven Spielberg blockbuster for being staged. Wrestling asks nothing of you but to suspend your disbelief for an hour or so, and allow yourself to watch a story unfold. When WOS Wrestling returns to our screens, take an hour to sit down with the kids to revel in an old, but not quite forgotten, British tradition. A lot of things have changed in the last 30 years, but our ability to scream blue murder at a hairy bloke in pants, hopefully, has not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be3020ea5ca0f7619b697beb3340f6cf176c9c38/0_142_4690_2814/master/4690.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9d65c1f67abf0dbece06f42a44ac199","title":"arizona teachers strike","story":"Educators across the state, some of the worst-paid in the US, are preparing to take action after strikes from West Virginia to OklahomaTeachers in Arizona will embark on another landmark strike on Thursday, the latest in a series of teachers’ walkouts over wages and funding that has spread across the US from West Virginia to Oklahoma.Tens of thousands of teachers across the state are preparing to walk out despite threats that their teaching licenses will be revoked. Seventy-eight percent of Arizona’s 57,000 teachers voted to strike. About 820,000 of Arizona’s 1.1 million public-school students will be affected by closures, according to an Arizona Republic analysis.“Governor Doug Ducey’s idea of taking money already designated for other worthy purposes is a ‘rob Peter to pay Paul’ scheme that is wrong and unacceptable,” said the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Arizona president, Ralph Quintana.The strike comes as Republicans in the deeply conservative state are reeling from a local election that saw their candidate win by a five-point margin in a seat that Donald Trump won by 21 percentage points in 2016.The state – which has passed tough immigration laws in recent years – has been successfully sued for attempting to ban Mexican-American studies in schools under threat of defunding school programs.People say “let’s not bring the race”, said the Arizona congressman Raúl Grijalva. “‘It’s simply about a conservative state and their teachers.’ Well, it’s much more complex. Some of the strongest support you are having is from Latino schools and Latino parents.”Grijalava said the Arizona teachers strike was calling out the racism that he believes is at the core of the underfunding of schools in the Latino community.Since 2008 the state has cut $1.5tn from the school budget and salaries for teachers rank as the 50th lowest in the country.Phoenix elementary school teacher Alexis Aguirre said she had had enough. Aguirre, who said she lives from paycheck to paycheck, said: “We have seen the dynamic of older white folks moving here in their retirement and having a culture shock in their community that is brown, that is immigrant. So they are coming into our community and they are telling us that we need to change that they don’t have kids and they aren’t going to fund schools.In Arizona, Latino community advocates said they were hopeful that immigrants and labor unions could help build new alliances and foster new partnerships around the need to improve schools.“It’s always been a civil rights issue for Latinos, just as immigration is a civil right for Latinos,” said Grijalva. “I think what the teachers are doing with their strike only clarifies that issues and gives it a profile that it didn’t have before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d8e12c120d8526fbb5e10c8d3003362736aa47/0_259_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2a5b19e3b6cf6b113f51a71c05e3979","title":"how palm oil ban has made the eu a dirty word in malaysia","story":"Angry farmers despair at what will happen to their livelihoods when the Brussels biofuels ban takes effect in 2020In the small farming settlement of Palong in rural Malaysia, the EU is a dirty word. A few months ago, these men – mostly in their sixties, their skin brown and weathered from years working the land – had never even heard of the European parliament: but now their livelihoods are at risk because of it.The crop they harvest is palm oil, one of Malaysia’s biggest exports worth $20bn a year. The European Parliament has voted overwhelmingly to ban the use of palm oil in all European biofuels by 2020, citing environmental concerns. If it is approved by the European Commission, the impact on the 650,000 smallholder palm farmers in Malaysia will be devastating. “I have spent all my money on the palm oil farm, I have recently planted new trees that will last for the next 25 years, and my whole family relies on this. It’s how my kids afford to study,” said Hussain Mohamed, 66, who has had his 10-acre plantation for over 30 years, and supports his entire family on the income. “Our whole community here totally depends on palm oil. But now we hear about the EU biofuel ban and this came as a shock to us, we still do not understand it and everybody is scared of what is going to happen to us in two years time. We have all signed petitions,” he said.Shaking his head angrily, he said the uncertainty had already affected the selling price of palm oil. “I am proud of my farm, I really take care of the trees every day. How can they say I am bad for the environment?”In the past few years, campaigners have gathered mountains of damning evidence that the growing demand for palm oil from the EU and China has fuelled massive illegal deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia by governments and big corporations, forcing several species to the brink of extinction. Lehan Samiran, 62, who has had his 10 acres since 1981, shook his fists angrily. He has three children in university who are all supported by the income from his palm oil farm. “Why are the EU doing this to us?” he said. “They have not thought about the farmers, about the human price. The statement ignored us. They are so far away they do not care. We are not harming the environment, we are looking after it. I am very angry, everybody is very angry. How can we not be, this will affect our rice bowl.”The EU is Malaysia’s third biggest palm oil customer, and much of it is imported to make biofuels. The farmers and Felda also fear the resolution would be just the first step towards banning palm oil outright in the EU. Iceland supermarket has already said it will not use palm oil in its own- brand goods. The proposed ban in biofuels, which is part of a revision of the EU’s renewables directives, has already prompted the rumblings of an international trade dispute, with Malaysia and Indonesia threatening retaliatory sanctions against EU goods in response, and Malaysia reportedly threatened to cancel defence contracts worth £5bn if the UK backed a palm oil ban in Brussels.MEP Kateřina Konečná, who was the first to bring the motion to ban palm oil to the European parliament said that while she understood the plight of the small farmers, “these smallholders are a slice of big national and international corporations who are responsible for deforestation.” But a spokesperson for Felda, questioned why palm oil had been singled out over other vegetable oils used to make biofuels - many of which, like rapeseed, are grown in EU countries - calling it “crop apartheid” and condemned the EU for disregarding “the hundreds of thousands of lives it will destroy”.“It’s the same colonial attitudes, the white man imposing their rule on us from afar.” he said. “If the EU respect Malaysia as a sovereign country and as a partner in development and trade, they should not put this unfair restriction on us, and instead work with us on environmental concerns. Freezing us out is wrong.”He was echoed by Dato’ Haji Aliasak Bin Haji Ambia, the President of the National Association of Small Holders Malaysia. “Palm oil has allowed the rural poor in Malaysia to develop our own land, lift ourselves and our families out of poverty, and take control of our own economic destiny,” he said. With the Malaysian election coming up on 9 May, this is also a pivotal issue. Felda farmers are a key support base for the ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and prime minister Najib Razak has made promising to defend palm oil one of the talking points of his campaign. Greenpeace this week published further evidence that palm oil has driven further forest clearance in Papua, Indonesia, tainting its reputation further. Yet a ban does not necessarily solve the environmental problems.The market for biodiesel in the EU is still growing, with a large percentage currently made from palm oil. Should the ban be implemented, other vegetable oils will have to be be used in its place, such as soybean oil, which has also been proved to be environmentally destructive, responsible for mass deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.There are also wider political ramifications of the EU ban. Banning palm oil in biofuels is likely to also weaken the EU’s influence in southeast Asia, and hand even more more power to China – the biggest palm oil customer in the world – at a time when the EU has expressed concern about increasing Chinese domination of the region. But for the country’s farmers, this is simply about sustaining the food in their rice bowls. Nur Harun Muhammad, 64, stood among the palms that he has tended to every day for the past 35 years and smiled widely. “See, not poison, not bad,” Nur said, showing off the bright yellow palm oil that had oozed out onto his hands. “When you go back to England please, please tell them palm oil is good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a23a9d8b06b611c69cbd039a0627dbc846008e1/599_574_3714_2229/master/3714.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d3af64c21687f231a23fd5c643ec28","title":"now chance kosovo deal serbian president what cost aleksandar vucic","story":"Aleksandar Vučić will accept independence only if Serbia gets something concrete in returnWhen Nato bombed Serbia in 1999, Aleksandar Vučić was information minister, enforcing censorship rules for the country’s president, Slobodan Milošević, who would later be indicted for war crimes.Nearly two decades later, Vučić himself is Serbia’s president. Claiming to have shed many of his former nationalist views, and brushing off accusations of authoritarianism, he is now seen by the international community as the man who could sign an agreement that would eventually bring reconciliation over Kosovo. The former province of Serbia pulled away from Belgrade under international supervision after the Nato air campaign, and proclaimed independence in 2008. Serbia still considers the territory its own.In an interview with the  in Belgrade this week, Vučić said he believed there is now a brief window of “six months or a year” in which it might be possible to sign a deal.“We are ready to discuss every single issue, we are ready to take into consideration every single proposal that would mean a compromise solution,” he said, provided Serbia is offered something in return.Kosovo is recognised by more than 100 nations, but there are still five EU countries that do not recognise it, mainly because they fear it could set a precedent for their own domestic territorial disputes. Nor do China, India and Russia. The hope in Brussels is that a deal could be struck that would lead to Belgrade acknowledging if not formally recognising Kosovo’s independence, and would pave the way for Kosovo to take a seat at the UN and for both nations to begin a path towards EU membership.Vučić has been playing up these hopes, but in return wants a package of benefits for Serbia. He is already involved in regular EU-supervised dialogue in Brussels with Kosovo’s president, Hashim Thaçi, which attempts to implement the provisions of an interim agreement signed five years ago. Thaçi also told the  last week that he expected a comprehensive agreement to be reached this year. Vučić has also spent the past months engaged in a whirlwind of meetings with western leaders, trying to convince them that they should offer a compromise solution that brings concrete benefits for Serbia rather than simply acquiesce to the facts on the ground.That Vučić could be the one to sign the deal is remarkable, given that in the 1990s he was part of the Radical party, which sought a Greater Serbia and supported the Serb political and military formations fighting in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Vučić, however, is a man of contradictions. He dominates the country’s political scene, having transformed the presidency from a largely ceremonial role to the centre of power after moving over from prime minister’s seat last year. Unlike other domineering leaders, however, there are no wild gesticulations or frothing oratory. His voice rarely rises above a mumble, and he uses whispered emotional appeals, portraying himself as a tireless martyr for the Serbian cause. “I am squeezed on a daily basis,” he said. “It’s mainly Kosovo to tell you truth. Everything else is peanuts. I have invested at least 400 days so far in the last four years since I became prime minister, only on Kosovo. It takes your energy out, and people don’t see it, they don’t understand it.”After meeting Angela Merkel in Berlin this month, he said he had not been able to sleep the night before and was unable to eat during the meeting because he was so nervous about the fate of Serbia.Vučić’s critics say this is all part of a carefully constructed image of a selfless fighter for Serbia that masks a raw drive to consolidate power. “This is kind of a new style in world politics, creating a public image as the ‘best’ person in Serbia,” said Boban Stojanović, of Belgrade University’s faculty of political science. “But actually we have corruption, little free media and are on the path to a one-party system.”The EU and other institutions have also criticised Vučić for a media crackdown, an accusation he brushes off, saying the media atmosphere is partisan on both sides and complaining of a “campaign 247 against me” from independent media.European leaders may be willing to extend credit to Vučić though, both because he is seen as able to deliver a compromise package on Kosovo that a weaker leader would not be able to sell to Serbian public opinion, and because of desires to counter Russian influence in the region. The European council president, Donald Tusk, who was in Belgrade to meet Vučić on Wednesday, said after their talks that he viewed the Serbian president as a soulmate and that Vučić was “living proof that you can be at the same time a strong patriot and a reasonable pragmatist”.At a time when relations between Russia and the west are at a low point, Vučić perhaps more than any other world leader is walking a tightrope between the two, insisting European integration is a top priority for Serbia while maintaining very close links with its traditional ally in Moscow.In a sign that he still performs a careful balancing act between past and present, he declined to say whether he would refer to nationalist Vojislav Šešelj, his former political mentor, as a war criminal, after a UN court in the Hague this month overturned an acquittal for inciting crimes during the 1990s.But he did say he regretted many of his own earlier nationalist outbursts.“Do you know someone in the entire world that is not a sinner? I haven’t met that guy so far. The difference is that I do acknowledge that and I was totally sincere with our people.”Vučić is still only 48, and many say that with his appetite for power and sense of historical mission, he could be planning to stay around for the long haul, perhaps eyeing a decades-long reign of power in the mould of Milo Djukanović in neighbouring Montenegro.“I can guarantee it’s not going to happen,” said Vučić, briefly laughing before transitioning back to his characteristic beleaguered whisper. He said he would “most probably not” stand for the presidency again in 2022: “I don’t have that kind of energy.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474244.1524682835!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland has 208 border crossings officials from north and south agree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBorder country: one of the 208 crossings between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyIreland has 208 Border crossings, according to the first officially agreed count since the island was partitioned, almost a century ago.Emails between Government technicians reveal they endured a “nightmare” trying to definitively map out all roads, paths and dirt tracks that traverse the 500km frontier. In addition to technical limitations, there was confusion about crossings where the Border runs up the middle of roads or juts in and out of routes, or where roads are privately owned on one side and publicly maintained on the other.The joint mapping exercise involving the Department of Transport and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure, which started last year, came to light after being referred to in minutes released after a Freedom of Information request.Newly disclosed documents charting the process since then show the Border runs along the middle of 11 roads, which is more than twice the number originally believed, while the frontier meets in the middle of at least three bridges and dissects two ferry crossings.On one section of the Dublin to Belfast motorway, traffic travelling in one direction is in the North while that travelling in the opposite direction is in the South, the documents also reveal. It is “half north and half south”, an official says.Previous estimates put the number of road crossings between Ireland and Northern Ireland – the UK’s only land border with another European Union country – at 275. In one of the final emails between Dublin and Belfast in recent weeks, signing off on the first agreed count, an official concludes: “I’m now getting 208 Border crossings in total, hope you are too.” The final figure will confirm there are more crossings in Ireland than along the entire border between the European Union and the countries to its east, which has 137.The emails show officials immediately ran into difficulties when they began working together, last November, over differing classifications between Belfast and Dublin of whether roads were public or private. “It’s almost impossible . . . due to the variation in this on each side,” said one.Another official conceded the final report on Border crossings may have to carry a disclaimer. “With something so ambiguous as the Border there will be a few metres out here and there,” he said.A third added: “There are practical implications when it comes to roads that are split along the middle that probably can’t be represented on maps but that is as good a way of representing it.”The Department for Infrastructure said it expects the final report to be made publicly available in the coming weeks.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475240.1524745154!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk needs to climb down from brexit barricades hogan says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commissioner Phil Hogan: ‘We must be on our guard.’ File photograph: Eric VidalReutersEU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan has called on the UK to “climb down from the barricades” and find a Brexit solution in the best interests of its people.In an address to the Seanad Mr Hogan said the UK “wants to keep its red lines, understands that a free trade agreement means a hard border, and is trying to escape by ‘inventing’ a new type of border.“It says a soft border can be assured - even in a free trade agreement - through new customs practices and modern technology, what I have called a cyber border,” he told Senators.“The EU has looked at the UK’s ideas is not convinced that they can give us the border security we need, within the Brexit timescale and has sent the UK back to the drawing board. Meanwhile it insists on the back-stop of a customs union for the whole island.”He said British prime minister Theresa May wants the UK “to retain many of the advantages it gains from EU membership. She has given us a long list of what the UK wants to keep. A very long list. “On the other hand, she maintains her red lines.”But said future discussions would show how badly the UK wanted this. “ And by future discussions, I don’t just mean Brussels-London, I mean also the London-London discussions. Indeed, I would say that London-London is the more critical.”The former Fine Gael minister said some form of customs arrangement and the softening of Britain’s red lines “must be in the best interest of all concerned”.He added: “Or do the Brexiteers want to carry on the civil war until there’s not a building left standing on the other side? Is this the sort of victory they seek? If so, they don’t only endanger the UK’s economy but its society also.”Stressing that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and his Government, supported by the EU, “have made it clear that they are not fudgers”, he said the UK “has to face up to the fact that decision time is here”.He described comments by Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg on Irish beef as both unhelpful and irresponsible. Mr Rees-Mogg said the Irish agriculture industry would be in serious trouble if the UK applied the common external tariff on Irish beef and he believed Britain was in a very strong negotiating position because the EU did not want to sacrifice the Irish economy on the altar of EU ideology.Mr Hogan said that instead of “costly immoderate ideology”, the EU and UK should “compare and honestly weigh the costs and benefits of a free trade agreement versus a customs union this is a moment for balanced judgement”.He said “now that Brexit is irreversible, such a review would be the statesmanlike option”.Mr Hogan also warned of the dangers of fake news . “The way in which what we used to call tall stories and gossip no longer goes from mouth to mouth but from one set of fingers to a million sets of eyes, with a tap on the keyboard. Brexit shows us how vulnerable we are.”He said hat was why the commission is alerting member states to the dangers, “advising them to set up an infrastructure that can counter the lies and half-truths”.He said it was particularly urgent and significant given next year’s European Parliament elections. “We must be on our guard,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3474240.1524696521!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk trapped by self imposed contradiction on brexit says hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit warning to Theresa May: “The UK has to face up to the fact that decision time is here.” Photograph: AFPGettyThe United Kingdom is trying to invent a new kind of Border that will not work because it is trapped by the “self-imposed contradiction” of its Brexit position, the EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan, will tell the Seanad today.“The UK has to face up to the fact that decision time is here,” Mr Hogan will say, echoing the warning of the European Council president, Donald Tusk, last week. “The EU must be satisfied the UK’s invention will work or it is the backstop. The deadline is set for June. No decision, no withdrawal treaty. No withdrawal treaty, no transition.”Mr Hogan will also take aim at the unwavering commitment of the British prime minister, Theresa May, to her “red lines” opposing a customs union, hinting that “London-London” discussions, between Brexiteers and Remainers, “will show us how badly the UK wants what the prime minister has asked for”.In Brussels much hope is being placed on the possibility that the House of Commons will overrule Ms May on the customs union.Mr Hogan will also suggest that Ireland, while maintaining its neutrality, needs to think again about its attitude to European security. “For us, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, security questions may sometimes seem remote. But is this a moment for us to review our thinking on these wider, strategic questions?“We have felt the strength and benefit of EU solidarity over the past couple of years. Imagine what it means to our fellow members in the Baltic region, for example, who border Russia and have large Russian-speaking populations. Imagine what it means to those member countries that are in the front line in dealing with immigration from the Middle East and the Mediterranean.“As part of the EU we all share the union’s destiny. We who have felt, and are still feeling, the benefits of its solidarity should be ready to ask how we may better contribute to the solidarity offered to others. We value our neutral status but should not stand aloof because of it. We should also want to play our full part in the union’s security.”Mr Hogan warns that Brexiteers appear to “want to carry on the civil war until there’s not a building left standing on the other side. Is this the sort of victory they seek? If so they don’t only endanger the UK’s economy but its society also.” Mr Rees-Mogg said: “If we were to apply the common external tariff on Irish beef, the Irish agricultural industry is in serious trouble.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

We began focusing on knotweed at a time when there was a great deal of hysteria surrounding it.\u0026quotAt the time, most information for people affected by the plant was largely based on anecdote. This led to the prospect of unscrupulous companies offering expensive and ineffective treatment solutions.\u0026quotIt was incredible to us that there was no long-term, large-scale field trial analysis of the treatment methods used to control Japanese knotweed.\u0026quotProfessor Dan Jones said gardening companies who claim to be able to eradicate the plant were not fully accurate.He said: \u0026quotOff the back of the first three years of data we\u0027ve found that eradication is not possible. Hopefully over the longer term we may move towards that by using new chemicals we\u0027re looking at.\u0026quotBut it\u0027s not a question of eradication, it\u0027s a question of sustained control and management and well informed control and management.\u0026quotClaims made by companies, stating that they could eradicate Japanese knotweed using herbicides in short spaces of time have now been proven to be false, based on our experiments.\u0026quotFurthermore, we have shown that applying the wrong herbicides at the wrong time of the year leads to greater herbicide use and environmental impacts.\u0026quotDr Jones said the best chemical to control the knotweed was glyphosate - but the herbicide is feared to pose a risk to other wildlife too.Japanese knotweed – everything you need to knowDr Jones said: \u0026quotThere\u0027s a range of issues in terms of risk and hazard. There\u0027s a political issue around glyphosate as well.\u0026quotWhat we\u0027ve done is work with the biology of the plant to minimise the amount of herbicide we\u0027re using over a treatment life cycle.\u0026quotAlthough we\u0027re using quite a contentious herbicide in that respect, we are using far less of that herbicide than you would use for other products that don\u0027t work on Japanese knotweed.\u0026quotHousehunters looking at homes in areas dense with Japanese knotweed can often struggle to secure mortgages - over fears the roots could cause structural difficulties to buildings.Chartered surveyor David Gregson, who provides specialist advice on the issue, said: \u0026quotThe main problem is mortgage lenders are very reluctant to lend on properties where knotweed is present and obviously that means in turn people can\u0027t sell their properties and it might sometimes be because knotweed is present in the next door garden.\u0026quotA typical situation is a couple wanting to get orced. They\u0027ve got a lot of knotweed in their garden, they both want to move on with their lives and they\u0027ve got a house they can\u0027t sell.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyPalestinian refugee camp in Syria turns \u0026#39unimaginably brutal\u0026#39 as Assad regime drives Isil out of YarmoukComment: When will Democrats realise their obsession with Russia is turning off American voters?Admiral Ronny Jackson withdraws as Donald Trump\u0026#39s veterans affairs nomineeInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaHow Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s wife Ri Sol-ju went from cheerleader to North Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39first lady\u0026#39Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsHospital boss bans employees from telling patients trust is short-staffedKim Jong-un meets Moon Jae-in: How an heir to a dynasty and a child of refugees could bring about Korean peacePrince Harry asks William to be best man at his Royal wedding to Meghan MarkleBBC withdraws Human Planet series after whale hunt scenes exposed as more fakery Modern language slump in Scottish schools amid teacher shortagesSwiss brewery provokes Nepalese fury by naming beer after late KingNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal. And by 2016 at least four WHO world regions should have eliminated measles – only one, the WHO region of the Americas, has achieved this. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said World Immunisation Week, was an opportunity \u0026quotto remind everyone of the incredible value of vaccines\u0026quot.\u0026quotYes, vaccines work, vaccines prevent disease, vaccines save lives,\u0026quot he said. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Palestinian refugee camp in Syria turns \u0026#39unimaginably brutal\u0026#39 as Assad regime drives Isil out of YarmoukComment: When will Democrats realise their obsession with Russia is turning off American voters?Admiral Ronny Jackson withdraws as Donald Trump\u0026#39s veterans affairs nomineeInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaHow Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s wife Ri Sol-ju went from cheerleader to North Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39first lady\u0026#39Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsHospital boss bans employees from telling patients trust is short-staffedKim Jong-un meets Moon Jae-in: How an heir to a dynasty and a child of refugees could bring about Korean peacePrince Harry asks William to be best man at his Royal wedding to Meghan MarkleBBC withdraws Human Planet series after whale hunt scenes exposed as more fakery Modern language slump in Scottish schools amid teacher shortagesSwiss brewery provokes Nepalese fury by naming beer after late KingNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

It emerged that film-makers had staged scenes of a rainforest tribe supposedly living in a treehouse 140 feet from the ground.The opening episode of the 2011 series visited the Indonesian island of Lembata and focused on a young man named Benjamin Blikololong. He was shown jumping into the sea during a sperm whale hunt, and viewers were told he had succeeded in harpooning it.A voiceover from John Hurt said: “Benjamin’s moment has arrived.” After he leapt into the water brandishing the weapon, Hurt said: “He’s got it.” Viewers are then Blikololong received a larger share of the whale meat because he \u0026quotstruck the decisive blow\u0026quot.The voiceover said Benjamin struck the first blow during the huntBut a journalist writing a book on the whale hunters, who live on the tiny island of Lembata, met Blikololong and heard that he had not harpooned the whale. He then contacted the BBC.In a statement, the corporation said: “The BBC has been alerted to a further editorial breach in the Human Planet series from 2011.“In Episode 1, Oceans, a Lamaleran whale hunter named Benjamin Blikololong is shown supposedly harpooning a whale. On review, the BBC does not consider that the portrayal of his role was accurate, although the sequence does reflect how they hunt whales.“The BBC has decided to withdraw Human Planet from distribution for a full editorial review.”In all, there have been four fakery stories surrounding the series.The whale hunt itself was not staged, the BBC saidIn 2015, the corporation admitted that it had used a semi-domesticated wolf in one episode because the crew were unable to find a wild one.And shots of a tarantula, purporting to be taken in the Venezuelan jungle, were actually taken in a studio.At the beginning of this month, it was revealed that a 140-foot high treehouse said to be a home to the Korowai people in Papua New Guinea was built for the benefit of the cameras.Writer and adventurer Will Millard went to the village to film another BBC series, My Year With The Tribe, and learned the truth.The BBC said standards had been raised since Human Planet was made. “Since this programme was broadcast in 2011, we have strengthened our training for the BBC\u0027s Natural History Unit in editorial guidelines, standards and values.\u0026quotPalestinian refugee camp in Syria turns \u0026#39unimaginably brutal\u0026#39 as Assad regime drives Isil out of YarmoukComment: When will Democrats realise their obsession with Russia is turning off American voters?Admiral Ronny Jackson withdraws as Donald Trump\u0026#39s veterans affairs nomineeInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaHow Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s wife Ri Sol-ju went from cheerleader to North Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39first lady\u0026#39Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsHospital boss bans employees from telling patients trust is short-staffedKim Jong-un meets Moon Jae-in: How an heir to a dynasty and a child of refugees could bring about Korean peacePrince Harry asks William to be best man at his Royal wedding to Meghan MarkleModern language slump in Scottish schools amid teacher shortagesSwiss brewery provokes Nepalese fury by naming beer after late KingNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

She said that her child had been disturbed by the publication of the photograph, which she considered to be private.The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The photograph had been taken ten years ago, so it did not consider that the child, who was not named in the article, would be easily recognisable from the image. It also noted that the image was publicly available on the complainant’s public Facebook page. The newspaper said that in any case, there was also a public interest in publishing the photograph as it helped to bring home to readers the gravity of the situation in which children had been involved.The article clearly reported on a subject which involved the child’s welfare: she had been involved in a shooting and had witnessed her mother being shot and seriously injured. The un-pixilated photograph of the child showed her full face. The image of the child had been taken 10 years ago however, this did not justify the newspaper’s decision to publish it un-pixilated in the context of this article as the child was still under 16 at the time of publication.Publishing the unedited image in the context of this story, without the consent of a parent or a similarly responsible adult, represented a breach of Clause 6. There was no specific public interest in publishing this image, particularly as an exceptional public interest justification was required in the case of a child. The complaint under Clause 6 was upheld.Palestinian refugee camp in Syria turns \u0026#39unimaginably brutal\u0026#39 as Assad regime drives Isil out of YarmoukComment: When will Democrats realise their obsession with Russia is turning off American voters?Admiral Ronny Jackson withdraws as Donald Trump\u0026#39s veterans affairs nomineeInside Panmunjom: The DMZ \u0026#39truce village\u0026#39 that will host historic talks between Kim Jong-un and South KoreaHow Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s wife Ri Sol-ju went from cheerleader to North Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39first lady\u0026#39Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsHospital boss bans employees from telling patients trust is short-staffedKim Jong-un meets Moon Jae-in: How an heir to a dynasty and a child of refugees could bring about Korean peacePrince Harry asks William to be best man at his Royal wedding to Meghan MarkleBBC withdraws Human Planet series after whale hunt scenes exposed as more fakery Modern language slump in Scottish schools amid teacher shortagesSwiss brewery provokes Nepalese fury by naming beer after late KingNeutral ground or dramatic backdrop?

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they are used inappropriately, then I am clear that this will have to change.”She went on: “I have asked officials to provide me with a full picture of performance measurement tools which are used at all levels and will update the House and the Home Affairs Select Committee as soon as possible.”Amber Rudd denys Home Office have set deportation targetsMs Rudd again repeated that she had not been aware of the targets being used by some officers, but then added “I want to be aware of them”.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott highlighted the resignation of former foreign secretary Lord Carrington, who quit after The Falklands were invaded saying it was “a matter of honour”.We now understand that people have been removed because of targets, and she said she didn’t know. I say with all conscience, is she really the right person to lead this office of stateShe went on: “Isn’t it time that the home secretary considered her honour and resigned.”Other Labour MPs also set their targets at Ms Rudd, including David Lammy who has been at the forefront of campaigning for those affected by the Windrush scandal.The Tottenham MP said: “I asked the minister at the last urgent question how many people had been deported, she said she didn’t know. I asked her how many people had been imprisoned in our own country, she said she didn’t know.Amber Rudd says she ‘bitterly, deeply regrets’ failing to see the Windrush scandal sooner“There are impact statements that have been ignored. There are letters from MPs and she said she wasn’t aware of a pattern.“We now understand that people have been removed because of targets, and she said she didn’t know. I say with all conscience, is she really the right person to lead this office of state.”Ms Rudd said that there was an “element of surprise” in the systemic nature of the problem around the Windrush victims, but argued that she had worked to address the problems raised by Mr Lammy after they were brought to her attention.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

Downing Street, where Mr Robbins now heads up the Brexit unit, however confirmed last week that UK negotiators are still arguing for the solutions proposed in the position papers in talks, stating that “the two proposals we have put forward remain the basis for our negotiation position”.The same proposals interrogated by Mr Sterling in the letter were reportedly rubbished by EU officials during the talks and subjected to a “systematic and forensic annihilation” during meetings with the European Commission in Brussels.The letter to Mr Robbins, dated 23 August 2017 says: “While the position papers have helpfully started a dialogue on movement of goods, many of the issues raised in June still require exploration.”While the position papers have helpfully started a dialogue on movement of goods, many of the issues raised in June still require explorationDavid Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland civil serviceGoing into detail about the issues with the UK customs proposals, Mr Sterling said plans to exempt small businesses from customs suffered from issues of practicality.“The iding line between businesses of different sizes in Northern Ireland supply chains will undoubtedly be blurred. This could make it difficult to accurately define which businesses are exempt from customs processes,” he said.“For example, bulk tankers owned or contracted by Irish milk processing firms collect raw milk from multiple farms in Northern Ireland before returning to Irish processing facilities.”He adds: “Small businesses trading on the island of Ireland may also be using inputs from outside these islands, or be part of an island of Ireland supply chain that ultimately sells into world markets.”The NI executive civil service chief also highlighted concerns with plans for a “robust enforcement mechanism” to keep goods from crossing the border.“The visibility and impact of a ‘robust enforcement mechanism’ to ensure goods not complying with the EU’s trade policy (whether through a lower tariff or erging standard) stay in the UK is a significant challenge,” he said.“The example of Turkey illustrates that customs duties are only one part of the picture and technical barriers can be equally disruptive to trade. Potential trade barriers created by erging tariffs or regulatory standards are therefore a key area for ongoing discussion. DAERA is currently engaged with DEFRA on complex sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues. “In a separate leaked document also seen by The Independent, an internal economic analysis drawn up by the Northern Ireland executive’s Department for the Economy warns that the province’s economy will suffer because of Brexit whatever solution is applied.“There is no quick or simple solution to the land border,” the assessment, dated May 2017 says. “There is likely to be some negative impact on the economy whether border controls are sited at the land or sea border, at least in the short-to-medium term. The policy question is therefore how these impacts can be minimised and what transitional support is required.”The Government has declined to comment on the leaks.There has still be little progress on the border question in talks this year, despite the opening of talks about the future relationship last week.Under the Good Friday Agreement there can be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and both sides agree that none should return. The EU however says the customs union and single market must have external border checks to maintain their integrity. Commission negotiators effectively proposed moving the customs checks to the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but Theresa May refused the approach after pressure from her allies in the DUP. Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

UK Brexit secretary David Davis said earlier this week that he was aiming for October.Mr Verhofstadt said negotiators “still have no proposal made by the UK side that could be a satisfactory solution for the problem”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They were later praised by Theresa May.Antisemitism demonstration in Parliament SquareAntisemitism demonstration in Parliament SquareHundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square to protest against antisemitism in the Labour Party.Protesters clashed during the demonstrationProtesters hold placards and flags during a demonstration, organised by the British Board of Jewish Deputies for those who oppose anti-Semitism, in Parliament SquareLabour MP Luciana Berger speaks during the protest.A protester blows through a shofar during the demonstration.Members of London\u0027s Jewish community protest in support of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn outside parliament.People protest against anti-Semitism in the Labour party as Jewish community leaders have launched a scathing attack on Jeremy Corbyn, claiming he has sided with anti-Semites again and again.

He resigned from that post over questions about his extensive lobbying overseas, including in Ukraine where he represented pro-Russian interests.\u0026#13Mr Gates joined the Trump team in spring 2016, and served as a top aide until he left to work at the Republican National Committee after the departure of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.\u0026#13George Papadopoulos was a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, having joined around March 2016.\u0026#13The President\u0027s eldest son met with a Russian lawyer - Natalia Veselnitskaya - on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard opposition research in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump\u0027s son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House. He met with a Russian banker appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Mr Kushner has said he did so in his role as an adviser to Mr Trump while the bank says he did so as a private developer.\u0026#13Former tabloid journalist and now music publicist Rob Goldstone is a contact of the Trump family through the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow. In June 2016, he wrote to Donald Trump Jr offering a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had information about Hillary Clinton. Mr Goldstone was the intermediary for Russian pop star Emin Agalaraov and his father, real estate magnate Aras, who played a role in putting on the 2013 pageant. In an email chain released by Mr Trump Jr, Mr Goldstone seemed to indicate Russian government\u0027s support of Donald Trump\u0027s campaign. Aras Agalarov (R) is a wealthy Moscow-based real estate magnate and son Emin (L) is a pop star. Both played a role in putting on the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. They allegedly had information about Hillary Clinton and offered that information to the Trump campaign through a lawyer with whom they had worked with, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone. Natalia Veselnitskaya is a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. She has worked on real estate issues and reportedly counted the FSB as a client in the past. She has ties to a Trump family connection, real estate magnate Aras Agalarov, who had helped set up the Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant which took place in Moscow. Ms Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort in Trump Tower on 9 June 2016 but denies the allegation that she went there promising information on Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. She contends that the meeting was about the US adoptions of Russian children being stopped by Moscow as a reaction to the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. Mr Flynn was named as Trump\u0027s national security adviser but was forced to resign from his post for inappropriate communication with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. He had misrepresented a conversation he had with Mr Kislyak to Vice President Mike Pence, telling him wrongly that he had not discussed sanctions with the Russian.Mr Kislyak, the former longtime Russian ambassador to the US, is at the centre of the web said to connect President Donald Trump\u0027s campaign with Russia. Mr Stone is a former Trump adviser who worked on the political campaigns of Richard Nixon, George HW Bush, and Ronald Reagan.\u0026#13The US attorney general was forced to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation after it was learned that he had lied about meeting with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak.Mr Page is a former advisor to the Trump campaign and has a background working as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.\u0026#13Mr Gordon met with Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 Republian National Convention to discuss how the US and Russia could work together to combat Islamist extremism should then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump win the election.
